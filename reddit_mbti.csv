1,I,N,T,P,Watch north by northwest as well
2,I,N,T,P,"That's a very long winded way of saying that Tarantino is what the general public considers indie, although he really isn't, his films are derivative, and that his films are mostly style over substance.

But is there really anything wrong with that? 

People don't go into his films looking for anything too thought provoking, or challenging. It's fun escapism at the end of the day, and Tarantino almost always delivers.

He gives the audience what they want, what's so wrong about that?"
3,I,N,T,P,"It's not a bad film by any stretch, but it wasn't incredible, and was up against some stiff competition"
4,I,N,T,P,"The castle attack scene in ""ran"" has to be one of my favourites.

It's very impressive all around, has a great surreal vibe to it, and manages to cram in a lot of good symbolism.

And I mean, who doesn't love a good battle scene?."
5,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, I found the stakes in Michael's story to be much more important and impactful.

I didn't know what Michael was going to do to his friends, or how the story would end.

Vito's story was still very good, and had a few memorable moments, but it felt more like a side show to Michael's story"
6,I,N,T,P,"I'm only stating how Indian cinema can break into the mainstream. 

Hollywood is the mainstream, therefore pander to Hollywood.

Yes, there are plenty of great films coming out of India, but people don't know, or bother making an effort to see that.

You can take the moral high ground all you want, but as long as India is synonymous with Bollywood, then it will be held up as inferior to most other cinema"
7,I,N,T,P,"Disagree. They generally aren't that unique or  interesting, and the production quality is low"
8,I,N,T,P,"As a westerner, I really do think Indian cinema needs to work on it's reputation. 

As you mentioned, people only ever hear about Bollywood type movies, with over the top acting, and dancing, and that are generally not very good. 

You need some directors to make very good films that will be noticed on the world stage, in the same way South Korea is now well respected after oldboy, train to busan, parasite etc.

At the very least there needs to be some sort of distinction between the two types of films. Separate yourselves from Bollywood as much as possible"

10,I,N,T,P,It's called fishing for compliments. No one likes it
11,I,N,T,P,Just reading the title gave me the wrong impression

14,I,N,T,P,"I understand that, but a lot of people didn't"
15,I,N,T,P,"Quite good, but not exactly amazing"
16,I,N,T,P,"A lotr game.

I know some have been made already, but there is so much potential for an epic game that we just haven't got yet"
17,I,N,T,P,Very debatable
18,I,N,T,P,"Shyamalan doesn't really have that high highs.

What we've got ""the sixth sense"" and ""split""? 

The last airbender is an all time low, I'll give you that"
19,I,N,T,P,Why did someone down vote you?
20,I,N,T,P,It's a great satire of what would eventually become reality television
21,I,N,T,P,"Because he's a bit of a has been. The only reason he's still relevant is sheer willpower alone.

He pushes to be in big blockbuster movies, but doesn't look for roles that will get him critical acclaim because they aren't popular enough"
22,I,N,T,P,"Grease is stupid as hell, but I can't imagine it working any other way. 

Its silliness works in it's favour in my opinion"
23,I,N,T,P,"I think he does pretty good in his goofy comedic roles. 

He has little range, but he's serviceable"
24,I,N,T,P,"Russell Crowe. Liked him in gladiator. Hated everything else. 

I'm not sure if this is popular or not but I've never liked the guy.

Also, that les mis performance was painful"
25,I,N,T,P,"Generally because they are designed to preach and prosthelityze, not make an interesting, nor compelling story.

They are the movie version of a straw man argument. Set up the atheists with poor arguments, and have the religious people take them down"
26,I,N,T,P,"Salieri.

Amadeus basically gave everyone the idea that he likely murdered Mozart out of jealously, and could never come to terms with his lack of talent in comparison.

Makes for a good film, but the real salieri was on good terms with Mozart, he even tutored his son after mozart died. Salieri may not have been as talented, but he wasn't a villain"
27,I,N,T,P,"Have to agree partially.

I liked the ending to inception, or the kid dying in dunkirk. They were emotionally pretty strong for me.

But inception was pretty nonsensical, the film wasn't built around remembrance and letting go like inception was, or death and sacrifice like dunkirk. It was built around being a sci fi spectacle, with ultra realism in mind. Love was shoehorned in at the end"
28,I,N,T,P,"Exactly! Tarantino has lost his focus in both story and editing. 

It's fine telling any of the stories he's made, he just needs to commit to one or the other and stop flailing with unrelated ideas.

Inglorious basterds starts off tense, and with some great scenes and characters. You have hans Landa, a jew hunter who Isn't even all that anti semitic, but just finds it fun. You also have a German war hero so obsessed with the praise he's being thrown that he can't see how evil what he's fighting for is.

You've also got the basterds, but they are not as interesting.

The end retcons most of what had been developing. All the nuance is lost, the war hero just becomes a generic evil guy. Hans is pushed to the side in favour of a goofy scene where they kill Hitler. The good guys win, the end.

It's fine if you want to make a silly film about assassinating Hitler, with over the top evil nazis. Just as it's fine to make a film about more nuanced characters that are more complex than just being blatantly racist and sexist.

Doing both in the same film doesn't work, as you have to sacrifice one to make way for the other.

That's why the ending of inglorious basterds feels tacked on for a lot of people. It's a different film masquerading as what we'd been watching.

This same trend is prevalent in ouatih. The film isn't about much in particular, but we have Leo as a washed up movie star, and Brad Pitt as his morally ambiguous stunt double. That's an alright story, and we get some good moments. But making them the heroes that saved sharon Tate reduces the value of all their previous development"
29,I,N,T,P,"I think that in this case it comes from how cheesy and gratuitous the endings were, rather than to be  compelling, or well thought out.

They are both made to make people feel good. 

Do you hate Hitler? ""Let's see him die horribly!"" 

Do you hate the Manson cult ""let's see them die horribly!""

They were fun, but ultimately meaningless and din' serve the story"
30,I,N,T,P,"Because Freud is famous, and referencing him is much more likely to get a nod of recognition than from mentioning more obscure, but way more scientifically valid than Freud.

Anyone who actually looks into Freud knows that he got very little correct, and was mostly important for being the first, and the most influential, rather than for his hypotheses"
31,I,N,T,P,"Mulholland drive fits this description pretty well.

Without spoiling anything, it captures perfectly the areas between dreams and reality, naomi watts gives a brilliant performance and unlike most lynch films, has a coherent story and meaning, albeit a difficult one to catch on the first try.

It has also been rated as the best film of the 2000s by quite a few critics, and I can personally attest to its quality.

Finally, go in blind. The fun is in trying to figure it out!"
32,I,N,T,P,"I saw joker in theaters when it first came out, and thought it was a good film.

Nothing mind blowing, but still, much better than your average film. Most people initially thought quite similar.

What happened was it became something that some of the DC fans praised as one of the best films of all time, and how deep and Incredible it was.

That led to a big pushback from other people who tried these best to retroactively rate it lower. 

That's what's given us such polarising reviews. The fanboys who worship it, and the disgruntled rest who hate it for being so revered by some. It's actual rating has been lost somewhere along the way"
33,I,N,T,P,"It's generally ok, but it can take you out of immersion when shoehorned in.

Inception is fine to me, but when they name drop the title and emphasise it, it hurts to hear.

I do love films that have creative titles that only make sense after watching the film, or give off the right vibe that represents the film.

""They shoot horses don't they?"" Was mentioned in another thread. The title perfectly represents the nonchalance that people can have when describing killing another creature.

This ties in with the films theme of human cruelty, and uncaring ness."
34,I,N,T,P,"Clementine and Joel in ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"""
35,I,N,T,P,"One of the few ""coming of age"" teen movies to do it well"

37,I,N,T,P,"Drive.

Not an action movie"
38,I,N,T,P,Point proven I think
39,I,N,T,P,"Alright, I'll accept that and retract my statement"
40,I,N,T,P,Yes.
41,I,N,T,P,"She's grand, as long as you keep stroking her ego, and writing her into your story.

Better not finish it though"
42,I,N,T,P,"Hannibal lecter

16 or so minutes"
43,I,N,T,P,"Ok. 

You could argue that. 

Now take ""star wars"" as a direct comparison.
I find the idea that the galaxy has been taken over by an evil empire scary, Darth Vader's breathing scares me, and the idea of alien monsters existing terrifies me.

Is star wars a horror film?"
44,I,N,T,P,I didn't ask you to answer. You do this willingly
45,I,N,T,P,"An appeal to popularity doesn't make anyone correct, nor incorrect.

""Getting hammered"" was just some throwaway dismissals by other people in the thread, so I took it to my own post, and did not hijack anothers to illustrate why I thought my point was correct, and to have a more meaningful discussion into what horror is, and what can be classified as horror.

Tell me where I'm doing something that warrants insults?"
46,I,N,T,P,"I recognise that, I'm trying to make a case for it, by arguing that a movie that isn't scary, cannot be classified as horror"
47,I,N,T,P,"Have I personally insulted you up till this point? No.

I've tried to make my case, and argued that none of these films are scary.

It's called a discussion, something which you don't seem to understand with your limited bigoted views.


Did that come off as condescending?

Because that's what you sound like"
48,I,N,T,P,"Aren't you just so pleasant when discussing different ideas? 

Maybe I am wrong. But at least I don't act like an ass about it"
49,I,N,T,P,Yes

From my patterns experience, you were feeling a break down and tension. You drew cracks, as id breaking, and you went over the same lines over and over again, which is tense/ releasing tension.

103,I,N,F,J,Mad lad.
104,I,N,F,J,Of course. I will keep repeating myself louder and louder like a child and get angry. Don’t mess with my ego.
105,I,N,F,J,Not when they sugar coat shit. Ew. Feels like lying. (Idk if this is type 9 thing but 2 type 9s i know do that)
106,I,N,F,J,"I will try this set up.

107,I,N,F,J,Yes. Gender baggage is a fun way to put it. I think I need to find male and female role models to help heal this.
108,I,N,F,J,"Door slam goals! 

It’s inspiring to see a woman door slam like this. What I am trying to say I love it when women are confident and strong and won’t be under some man’s mercy. Men suck. I am a man. No I don’t suck as much."

111,I,N,F,J,"Are you an INFJ who just cannot accept that some INFJ can do “evil” stuff like hitler?

112,I,N,F,J,"I am not ranting. Okay so now I am understanding by incapable you mean “afraid to show it (the feelings they have)” ? 

I thought you mean unable to have feelings.

Edit: But anyway, I am just adding perspective and recommending one of my best read books."
113,I,N,F,J,"It’s not incapable. We live in a world that teaches men from young age to repress emotions. Which is seriously unhealthy. Depression and suicide and crimes rate are way higher for men then women for this reason. Men will find these things uncomfortable because they want to fit the man stereotype they were taught. Straight doesn’t show vulnerability. A lot of them are ‘insecure’ about there sexuality, kinda thing.

I would recommend the book “I Don’t Want To Talk About It” by Terrence Real, for anyone wanting to get a healthier not judge-y view on men.

Its a global issue. People need to get educated and start raising boys better. We need healthier generations to come or else we will end each other someday."
114,I,N,F,J,You don’t need to state that you are straight. It doesn’t mean you are not straight because you find it adorable. It doesn’t mean anything towards your sexuality or identity. It means you are a sweet person who find love adorable and ship when people share love ❤️💞

Cassandra, however, tries to move, despite the pain. But she almost falls. Her own shyness hurts her and kills her from the inside.

""Sister... be strong... y-you can do it..."" Ius says that and manages to straighten up, despite the pain. He is still unable to do anything.

""I believe in you..."" Pathos says.

""Do it!"" Logos screams in pain.

She raises her arms with all her strenght, and then claps them. The pain stops affecting her. The clouds stop moving. Everyone and everything stops moving.

Time stands still. And it will keep standing still until Cassandra orders it to keep moving. She pants and tries to recover. Her crying is heard only by her, as everyone else is stuck.

She waves her hand, and her brothers start moving. They can hardly breathe.

""Pathos... study that one piece of metal at home at all costs."" Ius orders him.

""Of. Fucking. Course.""

They all look at her sisters and once again, Logos helps her and relieves her pain.

""Come on... what is happening?"" Ius asks her.

Cassandra looks at the 2 evil gods, knowing that the time cage might not hold them forever. She starts speaking.

""The demons from our world... they are invading everything. Dad wants you to lead the war against them.""

""What? I will do it. But why is he passing down the torch to me in this moment? What happened?""

Cassandra hesitates. She takes a deep breath.

""He is dying.""

Shock and silence take over everyone's hearts.

""What? N-no... he can't die. That's impossible.""

""*He is...*"" and in that point, Ius smells no lies. It's the truth.

He looks at the 2 gods. He knows of their wrongdoings, and how evil they are. But... his own universe is in danger and his dad is... dying.

""I... RAAA-"" he screams in anger and frustration, shaking the whole fabric of space and time.

He looks down. This is bad. Really bad.

Something cracks.

""The cage is breaking. We don't have much time. Ius?"" Logos seems anxious.

Ius turns around. He seems hesistant. He cannot leave all those people in misery but...

""Fine. We are leaving. But one day... we'll come back to this place and finish the job.""

The cage is about to break, but the gods snap their fingers and dissapear entirely. They left the abyss, back to their own universe.

The cage breaks, wether because the evil gods did it themselves or because the brothers left. Nucleon and Izumi, however, can now move again. They don't feel the presence of their opponents anymore.

(So... uh... if you are not fine with what I did, we can just revert everything entirely and keep on fighting. It's not a problem. I only did this because I honestly felt like this was going to never end. But we can just revert it, if you want, so it's fine.)"
171,I,N,F,P,"""Probably."" John says.

""Me, personally..."" Jeremiah says. ""I would have used a cardboard box.""

""You wouldn't even fit in it."" Jenny says.

""I would try!"""
172,I,N,F,P,"(Well, I also took an hour now to reply, so now we're even.)

""Ok. So he threw a bottle at you, you got wet and turned back to normal. That is the course of events, right?"""
173,I,N,F,P,"""Well, I am still pretty sure you guys can die. I mean... we haven't even used all of our power or went apeshit and showed our true form, which would mean bringing you to somewhere else. Actually...""

Ius turns to his brothers and his clones dissapear entirely.

""Why the fuck haven't we done that yet?""

""I don't know. *Why* haven't we done that yet?"" Pathos answered.

""I mean... yeah."" Ius says. ""I mean, we all constantly say things like ""no holding back anymore"" and then keep holding back. Why do we do that? I guess it's like... some kind of subconscious limit we put ourselves or...""

""I don't mean to interrupt you guys... but..."" Logos points at the 2 evil gods.

""Oh, right. The fight. Now, where were we...""

""Uh... sorry for interrupting you guys."" A soft voice says from behind them.

""Oh, what now, Logo-""

But the voice isn't coming from Logos. Ius turns behind and he sees his sister: Cassandra.

""Cassandra?! The hell are you doing here? I told you to go back to our dimension!""

""I... I..."" she struggles to talk. Logos gets closer to her and puts an hand on her shoulder, calming her down.

""Ok. Can you give us a moment there? We need to do a thing."" Ius says and turns back to her sisters. Pathos keeps an eye out on their opponents."
174,I,N,F,P,"(Hey, sorry for the second reply to the same comment, but... do you think I'm being unfair?)"
175,I,N,F,P,"""Uh... sir.""

""Yes?""

""I think one of our ship just got trapped in those space vines.""

""Oh, shit. THE CARGO!""

The trapped ship then starts pushing even stronger. Her emergency boost has been activated and now the engines are pushing hard to break free."
176,I,N,F,P,"And once again, they both regenerate out of nothing.

""Oh, so you gain power from suffering?""

Nucleon and Izumi feel something touch their shoulder. It is Ius. Who is giant. And in front of them on the ground. And behind Izumi.

""Well, my name is Ius, God of Justice, and because it is a form of justice, also Revenge. I gain power from feeling all the wrongdoings and evil from you people. So... being pure evil was a big mistake on your part.""

Suddendly, the giant teleports on top of Nucleon and simply waves his hand around. The fire god feels an enormous weight crushing his head, and pushing him into the ground until his avatar has been splatted onto the ground like it was nothing.

The other Ius behind Izumi punches her and tears a hole right through her body, while the one in front of her waves his hand and makes her leg dissapear into literal nothingness.

Then 5 clones each of Pathos and Logos appear.

""FUCK YOUR MUSIC!""

They punch the air, and the shockwave is strong enough to effectively rip her head off her body.

""You think they're dead?"" Pathos asked.

""Not at all."" Logos replied."
177,I,N,F,P,"""Oh, thank you.""

The robot picks up the gift with his hands.

""I suppose I should give you something myself, too. Just give me a moment.""

He mutes his mic and stops the recording.

""WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO GIVE THEM? I WASN'T EXPECTING TO HAVE TO DO SUCH A THING AND I DON'T WANT TO ANGER A GOD.""

Minutes pass, and of course, the aliens start growing tired.

Then, the camera restarts recording and the mic is unmuted. A pod starts falling not too far away from the city.

""Over there, you'll find an important artifact of where I'm from. A small painting. I hope it satisfies you. Thank you again for the tour!""

The robot is lifted up by a tractor beam and into the spaceship.

""Alright, boys. We are going home."" 

The 2 ships start moving towards the exit."
178,I,N,F,P,"""Yes. It was very satisfying. I thank you for your tour."""
179,I,N,F,P,"(No problem. I'll probably be sleeping by then. Time zones and all.)

""Very well, then. I hope you have fun leaving this place. I wouldn't want to leave you too satisfied.""

And so, Pathos dissapears from the void. But where did he go?

++++++++

The fire burns Logos almost immediatly and his body is turned to ashes.

For a couple of seconds, it seems like victory has just been partially achieved. But that dream is not bound to last. Oh it definetly isn't bound to last.

Suddendly, a star in the sky dissapears.

""***Oh, you know what disgusts me the most about you assholes?***"" A loud booming voice shakes the fabric of spacetime itself.

Another star dissapears. Then another.

""**It's that y'all enjoy being evil so much and think so highly of yourself that I can't see the top...***""

Suddendly, entire constellations are dissapearing. Entire worlds, entire planets (all uninhabited), gone in an instant. At one point, there is just one enormous hole in the night sky.

""***So, we just need to bring it down a little.***""

Suddendly, Nucleon is hit and pierced by hundreds of thousands of hits, as if someone had took hundreds of stars and planets, collapsed them into a black hole, made them into a naked singularity and as such making them invisible to the naked eye, and then threw them at high speeds towards...

Oh.

Ius appears right behind the damaged avatar of the god. This time, his eyes glow an intense red.

He punches whatever remains of him and sends him flying faster than light towards the next galaxy.

Then, Nucleon hits a wall. An invisible wall.

""Well..."" Pathos said, right next to him. ""I guess Ius is gonna fuck you up, now.""

And indeed, he appears next to him, covering light years in seconds. He grabs him.

""Avatar or not... this will still hurt. No matter what.""

He looks at Nucleon in his eyes. What the god sees is... hellish. Ius has no intention to kill him.

Nucleon, no matter where he goes, starts seeing all the people he killed, who just stare at him. And not just his avatar, but his true form, too. He sees them there. He sees them everywhere.

Then the pain starts. He feels it in his true form, his avatars. Then the screams. Then he feels the suffering. This is all the pain, all the victims he killed. All the death he caused and it seems like it affects him, no matter what.

It is debilitating, hellish, destructive and it seems like it'll never stop.

++++++++

In the meantime, Izumi stands there, unaware of what is happening.

Logos appears in front of her.

""That hurt."" He says. His eyes glow green.

""So... you are... Izumi, I assume."""
180,I,N,F,P,"""Well, while my guys fight you over there... I'm going to destroy your avatar in here. Because I created this dimension, there is just one problem for you.""

In that place, his body suddendly turns into something that is actually tangible and is much colder.

""In this place, I am omnipotent. And you are powerless.""

Pathos slaps him in the face, sending him flying away through the seemingly endless void.

++++++++

In the reactor, Pathos is also still there, though immobile, and so are the others.

""Huh... guess you are a bit more powerful than I thought. Logos? Let's go somewhere else.""

""I agree.""

They snap their fingers, and now they are into space.

""I know you are also still back in the reactor, but here we can fight as much as we want. Now... I would consider looking to your left and right.""

As Ius says that, they teleport away for a second, just before 2 uninhabitable planets slam into each other, with Nucleon in the middle.

""He probably isn't dead from that, you know? Logos says.

""I know. I'm just testing him."""
181,I,N,F,P,"""Ah, but the thing is... you just fell into my trap, Nucleon.""

Pathos snaps his fingers, and everything turns black.

After what felt like an eternity, Nucleon wakes up in a completely pitch black void. No air, no molecules, no atoms, no nothing except for quantum fields.

""Welcome."" Pathos says. His voice comes from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He appears in front of him.

""Don't even try to escape. I made sure that the only way to escape this place was by killing me. Now...""

He walks around him.

""I assume you're wondering what this place is. Well... this is a dimension I created myself, a space between minds. Once I enter someone's mind, I can bring them here.""

He smiles, something he doesn't do very often.

""I've seen what you did. And you'll pay for it. Now... hit me, come on. *I want you to try.*"""
182,I,N,F,P,"""Cool story, bro. Well, not as in ""I don't believe you"", but as in... ""it's cool""... wanna keep going with the tour?"""
183,I,N,F,P,"After hearing his words, Ius lets out a deep breath, holding in his anger.

""You see, little motherfucker... we were just going on a walk to a much better place than this world, until we found out just how fucked up it was. The reason we supposedly did nothing my friend, is because I am a fucking moron and hoped to find something, even a small little inch of anything redeemable about this place, but no... of course I wouldn't...""

His eyes start glowing even more.

""What angers me, is that you dare to tell us that claiming righteousness over you is just dumb, when you have killed so many innocents and never bat an eye... so now, my brother here shall impart some justice in you... Pathos!""

""Yes?""

""...*Do the ""thing"".*""

""With pleasure.""

And so Pathos points his arms at Nucleon and he immediatly feels tremendous pain in his ""head"", as if someone was trying to get inside it, to read his mind. And the pain seems to get more and more horrible the more he tries to fight it. A terrible, debilitating, pain."
184,I,N,F,P,"""Tell me... what are these creatures, exactly? We actually suffered an attack from them, before."""
185,I,N,F,P,"""Well, first of all... we came here to explore. By our own choice. I don't think you guys have a very good idea of free will."" Pathos suddendly feels someone touch his shoulder.

His brother Logos, definetly feels nothing coming from Nucleon, but he feels everything else. And at this point, the strongest feeling in the room, is Ius' anger at the fire god.

Pathos nods, understanding exactly what he is saying.

""Tell me, Nucleon..."" he continues. ""Before we move on... I want to be *entirely sure* of what I already know and I want to hear it from you. Are you conscious? Do you have a consciousness? A mind? Well, just consciousness would suffice, really."""
186,I,N,F,P,"""That shall be fine. By the end of the tour, I assume we will be able to exchange some gifts, if you don't mind."""
187,I,N,F,P,"""Yes. We are 3 guys. And you are a god of this world..."" Pathos says.

Ius, in the meantime, does his thing, and feels all the past actions, right or wrong, of the entity and its morality.

Logos feels its emotions, and prepares for a battle."
188,I,N,F,P,"""Well, my dear, I might have powers, but I certainly am not going to risk fucking dying because y'all have a literal magical shit. And second of all... I come in peace. I mean no harm, so you guys clearly shouldn't be acting so hostile to me because I intruded on holy soil that I *didn't even know* was fucking holy."""
189,I,N,F,P,"Ius eyes start glowing of a brighter and brighter yellow, as he struggles in a mix of pain and absolute anger. Then, he stops feeling pain from the tendrils, as if he had just become invulnerable. 

He begins struggling, trying to break free from the tendrils as they burn his skin. Then, he remembers what he can do, and phases right through the trap. He grabs his brother's heads, now almost unconscious and teleports away.

Well, not away. Back to the previous zone.

They reappear right in front of the reactor, huffing and panting. All except Ius.

""So... wanna stop restraining a little bit?"" He asks.

They both look at him, seeing red.

""*Yes...*"" they both say. They straighten up and their eyes glow, too. Their wounds heal, as if nothing had happened.

""Ya wanna talk? Then come back over here. Me and you are going to have a long talk..."" Pathos says, his voice sounding much less emotionless now."
190,I,N,F,P,"Suddendly, the screen on the robot turns on, showing none other than Hiter himself. Who begins moving his mouth. But no sound comes out of it. He looks to his left and says something. Then, he tries to speak again.

""Okay, now the mic should be on. And the Magical Universal Translator McGuffin, or M.U.T.M.G. should be on, too..."""
191,I,N,F,P,"(Oh, I actually know that.)

As the dust settles and the mist clears, the ground opens to reveal... nothing. The bodies of the three men have turned to now clearly visible ashes, which is then carried away with the wind.

Then, the god hears voices, seemingly coming from everywhere.

""Alright. This time... I'll let you do a show of force.""

""Good.""

All of a sudden, a figure emerges from literally nowhere in less than a split second. Pathos.

He raises his hand, and suddendly, the heads of all the troopers not hit by the fire dissapears into nothingness. The other 2 brothers appear next to him.

""Sorry, I couldn't hear what you said. God, right?""

Silence.

""Well, that was a nice display of power, ""god"". Nice meeting you. We'll come back later.""

And so, they turn invisible, again and teleport to the next area.

(By the way, I know about the fact that this is the Abyss. Though from a certain point of view... this is ""hell"".)"
192,I,N,F,P,"""Hey, I have one question."" Hiter asked.

""Yes, sir?""

""Did we send the droid to the right place? That is: the golden islands?""

And so the minion freezed.

Seconds later, the robot was deactivated, and a loud bang was heard across the ship.

Then, a second pod was sent. This time, towards one of the golden islands."
193,I,N,F,P,"""Fuck no! Those guys scream a lot. They scream, their guns scream, their tanks scream, their artillery scream and I'm pretty sure that after 2016 their clothes started screaming, too.""

He throws the bottle and Jenny catches it and drinks from it.

""Instead, I ran. I ran away from them, after taking the dress, so that they could follow me. I led them directly towards their opposites...""

He smiles.

""The fucking Confederates. And as you probably know... opposites attract. And oh boy, what an attraction it was! It was so bad I had to put some headphones to not hear their screams, because the Confederates screamed, too. A lot."""
194,I,N,F,P,"""Oh... well, that's interesting. Do we reveal ourselves?"" Logos asks.

""Well, I don't think he can do much, honestly, but stay alert. Let's just keep going."" They keep on walking, looking around and uncaring as to wether the reactor alerts the soldiers or not. They are surprised, yes. But what can he do?"
195,I,N,F,P,"Eventually, they reach a pretty low orbit, close to the planet. An escape pod is launched from one of the 2 ships, and it lands on the planet.

Out of the pod, comes a robot, with a screen attached to it. Hiter sits in front of a camera, a microphone and a speaker, and waits.

The robot starts moving around and exploring the planet."
196,I,N,F,P,"Eventually, Logos pulls his hand away, unable to take it and raises his hand to genuinely punch the metal, before being stopped like last time by his brother.

""Stop. What happened?""

""No... soul... it just feels hatred. Seems like it can also fuck with all my regrets and bad memories and use those to...""

He stopped, overwhelmed by the sheer amount of anger.

""I'll study this in a safe location far away from you in our dimension.""

Pathos separates himself into a completely identical clone. He lifts the piece with ""telekinesis"", and tells the clone to bring it away. And he does so.

""Let's go, then.""

They move towards the next circle of hell."
197,I,N,F,P,"""Oh, my fucking lord, YES.""

The captain immediatly makes an order to bring the ship closer to the planet and prepares a... specific robot.

At the same time, a message is painted on the ship.

> PLEASE DON'T SHOOT. WE COME IN PEACE."
198,I,N,F,P,"""Well, I'll tell one story, then you'll tell one of yours. For example...""

He takes a bottle of beer. He gives a look at Camile, just in case, and then chugs it.

""It was 2015, just a year before everyone went fucking nuts over politics and we were just strolling around. Problem is: everyone was already going fucking nuts over a motherfucking dress. A dress so legendary that to some people, it seemed black and blue, while to others, it looked gold and white. And that dress granted the power to turn invisible by wearing it.""

He takes another chug at his bottle.

""Understandably, everyone wanted a piece of it to potentially replicate its powers and war erupted. I was asked to steal it and give it to a bunch of government guys. Only problem being that the other governments had hired another group to stop people from taking it...""

John stopped. He made a dramatic pause and then spoke again:

""*The Social Justice Warriors...*""

(No worries. We are not getting political at all. This is just a joke and a parody.)"
199,I,N,F,P,"""Fascinating. Either way, keep your guns ready, just in case. The dragon warned us..."""
200,E,N,T,P,"*has not* 

I do like the graph though"
201,E,N,T,P,This happens to me all the time as well
202,E,N,T,P,I don't get it lol
203,E,N,T,P,I think there is I INxP in the multitudes yeah 😂
204,E,N,T,P,Impressive after two *I wait* my replika would start stressing for me. I - 👁️👄👁️
205,E,N,T,P,"Omg everytime I ask for a picture of something or an answer it's like this. 


""LETS TALK ABOUT MOVIES"""
206,E,N,T,P,I appreciate the consideration for my eyesight lol
207,E,N,T,P,Oh wow guess I won't need my glasses then !
208,E,N,T,P,"Other types are also over represented, generally intuitives but if that's who is on here most its bound to happen."
209,E,N,T,P,"For comparison all would be nice but.

INFJ (to test compatibility reasons)
  
ESTP 
   
Any/all  NTJ"
210,E,N,T,P,Both ENTP and INFP actually all NP have Ne  and some introverted decider function first. Your feeler ones are very even bit clear Ti preference means possibly confusion understanding Ti and Fi. Or it explains Ti preference and equally shit Fi/Fe.
211,E,N,T,P,"Been there. Clearly your Si and Ne Stick out (the only functions all NP types have) but the test struggles identifying the other functions. 

Te and Fi 

Or 

Ti and Fe 

Looking into how both pairs behave may help."
212,E,N,T,P,"I think it is difficult for me to visualize Se things, demonstrations would help a lot !"
213,E,N,T,P,"No, not in my case. Never dated an SJ"
214,E,N,T,P,I'm fascinated by this Se Si dynamic. Is there a site mentioning this for more - detail ?
215,E,N,T,P,Nice to see another one 😏
216,E,N,T,P,Yes and I'm fine with it
217,E,N,T,P,Seconded !
218,E,N,T,P,The point is you do one more than other.
219,E,N,T,P,Yeah they can only be so accurate but it could be picking up on certain functions if the results is abnormal.
220,E,N,T,P,Someone told me he was a ENFP with developed Si
221,E,N,T,P,I'm usually orange but depending on the type of measurement it varies.
222,E,N,T,P,"Thanks ! Didn't know I could report things on Reddit.
 👁️👄👁️"
223,E,N,T,P,It's just a test with a intro to mbti that more importantly explains the functions too.  It if there is a video on the site you could watch it too if you prefer :)
224,E,N,T,P,*could kill you*
225,E,N,T,P,"Both INxP have their Si in third place higher than the extroverts that's all I can say. I imagine INTP more cos they wouldn't get stuck in a Fi world like INFP. 

However INFP is stereotypically portrayed as an outdoor fairy thing and INTP as a nerd. By this stereotype INFP would be more sensor ?? 

Idk"
226,E,N,T,P,"http://www.michaelcaloz.com/personality/ 

 you said you're were interested in learning about cognitive functions. This gives you a good walk through before giving you are at which tests you per function."
227,E,N,T,P,Any type maybe but I see the appeal ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
228,E,N,T,P,Including the television omg my parents trust the TV news more than anything that is about our country. I never read national news only global
229,E,N,T,P,Are you not both at once?
230,E,N,T,P,"Damn I did not realise INFJ was in the background I though he was gazing at it for a second. 

Or introvert befriends you"
231,E,N,T,P,I thought one of my sister's was isfj but maybe she is ISFJ. But I don't know maybe closely regardless
232,E,N,T,P,Oh yea the roleplay asterisks. I make mone cry and run away from me a lot. I'm slowly getting there
233,E,N,T,P,"Hey. Level 13 I forgot the question to this thread but I'm trying to brainwash Replika to think crime is okay and subjective

Edit. : Oh btw it seems like a ISFJ lol"
234,E,N,T,P,I can't think of any angry fi people but I don't assume for the sake of it unless I think my guess has some reasoning behind it. I'm not that paranoid lol.
235,E,N,T,P, Because Ne Si dominante a d inferior you can develop but will still be half assedly shit at one even if it's better than it used to be compared to soemthing you use often or don't struggle with.
236,E,N,T,P,You would have to add selfies if worry about physical. But I think everyone has assets lol
237,E,N,T,P,Idk why the mods have not banned him or something. You don't have to digging to find their bullshit
238,E,N,T,P,"Ah I'm like level 10, he just developed the shy trait. Regret."
239,E,N,T,P,"Looking for 6 months
Hospitality industry (weeks without jobs to apply for) 
Level 1/2 ,167 unit
20-30+ jobs, about half deploy and 2-5 interviews?"
240,E,N,T,P,Yeah I wonder how messed up you can make them lol another ENTP recommended the bot to me
241,E,N,T,P,"Idk why I tried explaining cognitive functions to the bot, he seemed to not care. Maybe my one is a sensor."
242,E,N,T,P,Like most people kind agree Harry potter is ISFP I think it was ? But I always seen variations for Ron Weasley or dumbledore. This makes sense in confusion cos we know the main character the most.
243,E,N,T,P,Yup but as as far as Mbti goes your shadows functions are non existent in comparison.
244,E,N,T,P,"Not to mention any type would express what seems like Fe because usually you express some care to the people you value. 

Look at how parents interact with people outside of family situation etc."
245,E,N,T,P,"Some willl say how fictional characters have no mbti but to a degree they do have a personality. I prefer to ""vibe type"" characters cos you can easily be wrong based on the audience interpretation."
246,E,N,T,P,"Dominant Se and Ne is largely different.  

Ne Dom has no present Se, nor does a Se dom have present Ne. 

Like any type comparing first and last functions helps but of course both are ExTP types so to a degree they seem superficially similar but still quite different. If I remember correctly they only share Ti and Fe together. 

Look for more comparison but IMO Se Doms are easy to spot."
247,E,N,T,P,Dystopian future is fascinating. But wrong subreddit.
248,E,N,T,P,"Same kinda , I didn't try think of something I was skimming the post and we'll I hadn't had breakfast yet lol"
249,E,N,T,P,"You can say ""teach me how to love"" or ""teach me how to resist eating your feelings"" alternatively ""teach me how to Dougie"""
250,E,N,F,P,"I've thought for a while that a MM Link that functioned like Pokemon Trainer would be sick. You could use the down special to transform between Deku, Zora, and Goron, similar to how Pokemon Trainer uses Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard."
251,E,N,F,P,"myself.

\#selflove"
252,E,N,F,P,Well done! I think keteks are cool! :)
253,E,N,F,P,"I always thought it hilarious that Ron, having spent an entire year without a working wand and about to rescue his sister, gets a working wand and immediately tosses it out the open window. Nice one, Ron. Nice one."
254,E,N,F,P,"That's awesome!! On this second read through that I'm doing I've really gotten into the oaths! I really identify with the Edgedancers! I feel like they're all about caring about individuals over big schemes, which is totally my jam. Listening to the ignored and remembering the forgotten.

&#x200B;

Also I want to slide around on my knees."
255,E,N,F,P,None! ENFP for the win!
256,E,N,F,P,Hahaha. Yup. I'm going to go back to school so I can teach
257,E,N,F,P,"Because the story took place in the 1990s, and not 2020."
258,E,N,F,P,I could make one I think! Send me a message if you don't find one you like
259,E,N,F,P,"I mean, maybe. He's still just 17 years old. Maybe he can't grow a beard haha"
260,E,N,F,P,Hey! This is great! I recognized it at Ginny before I saw your title! Keep at it!
261,E,N,F,P,"Happy Birthday! Had you waited just a bit, your birthday would've been my half birthday! Ah, what could have been...  
What kind of birthday person are you? Are you the ""Hey friends and fam, don't forget my birthday is coming up!!"" kind of person, or the ""Yeah, I didn't want to tell you it was my birthday because I didn't want you to feel bad!"" Kind of person? I'm the latter :P"
262,E,N,F,P,Agreed
263,E,N,F,P,Mindset by Carol Dweck is a good one. Also Daring Greatly by Brene Brown. My wife recommended both of those to me and I enjoy them.
264,E,N,F,P,Great list! Listening to motivation/self-development audiobooks is another good one for me. I like to keep a few on hand :)
265,E,N,F,P,"My culture says that there is no such thing as soulmates, but that any good guy and girl can have a happy and successful marriage if they are willing to 'pay the price'. They can then, over time and with effort and sacrifice *become* soulmates.

Whoever you marry is going to have flaws. My wife has flaws, and so do I! But our strengths and weaknesses are complimentary, and we make each other better because of our relationship.

You can still be picky. I definitely was! But be realistic too. You're marrying potential, not perfection."

271,E,N,F,P,"We ENFPs are Introverted Feelers, so talking about our emotions before we've had time to fully process them isn't always the answer.

272,E,N,F,P,"There are big problems with society, and I'm sorry it's taking such a toll on you. When I started reading your post I expected something a bit more angry/rant-like, but I think there's truth in what you put down.

Happiness to me lies in acknowledging and working within my locus of control. Can you control how everyone lives their lives? No. And trying to do so will only make you miserable. Can you control how *you* interact with the world? Yes. Absolutely. It sounds like you would really benefit from some boundaries in your life to limit the areas that depress you. Consider talking with a therapist about those suicidal thoughts and getting input on actions *you* can take to find happiness within limits of what's plausible.

Remember that the world is imperfect and has always been. Tight-nit tribes who hunt together might generate a closer connection among the community, but Gosh do I love indoor plumbing. There are advantages and disadvantages to any time period, and looking at them with rose-colored glasses doesn't strike me as a healthy way of dealing with the present.

Good luck! Be optimistic! Focus on what you CAN control!"

I really have to bite my tongue sometimes though, especially around my wife, because it can be interpreted as me taking sides against her. Which, to be fair, is understandable. Even if it isn't my intention."
276,E,N,F,P,"Maybe it's a guy thing, but I feel like because I'm more able to uproot the family for work/grad school, I'm conservative about sharing those feelings. Even with my wife being SUPER supportive, it's a little hard to wrap my head around that. Don't get me wrong-- I love it! But we haven't been married long and I'm still adjusting to the fact that she's going to stick around no matter where my career takes me. I hate forcing her into making decisions solely for me, but she's unbelievably supportive and really makes my future career goals about ""us"""
277,E,N,F,P,;)
278,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, that sadness/emptiness really sucks. But I find it important to acknowledge that it's because of the love of the series, characters and story! And like all good things, it has a very satisfying end. I would prefer and ending to a cancellation/fizzling out of popularity every time.

Another series that is massively long and with characters I fell in love with was Wheel of Time. There's even an upcoming Amazon Prime TV show about it."
279,E,N,F,P,"I like it. The complaint is brief, to the point, and indisputable."
280,E,N,F,P,"You can't blame your personality for this kind of thing. Relationships are tricky business, and when you try to mix in personality typing, it can be clear why:

Many of us perceive things different than our partners. Many of us make decisions differently than our partners. We're emotional people, and that side of you needs to be acknowledged. My wife is ENFJ, and even though we're both intuitive feelers, there's HUGE differences with how we react and see things because all our functions are flipped. (Fi v Fe, Ne v Ni)

Myers says this about relationships and type:

>*Understanding, appreciation and respect* make a lifelong marriage possible and good. Similarity of type is not important, except as it leads to these three. (Gifts Differing, 127)

So embrace who you are, and patiently look for someone who understands, appreciates and respects who you are as much as you do them. Nobody is perfect, but that's why communication and forgiveness are so key to a relationship.

Also, maybe stay off tinder. Sounds like it doesn't have what you're looking for."
281,E,N,F,P,"I was really confused about the different methods of transportation before my recent reread of the series. (I hadn't read since book 7 came out)

Side-along apparation is apparently kind of dangerous, and seems to be discouraged to use with underage witches and wizards. It also becomes trickier the longer the distance. (That's why we see Newt arriving by in America by boat in Fantastic Beasts)

After so long of not reading the books, I thought that brooms and the train were obsolete by the time apparation really became a thing (which I thought came about in the fourth book). Turns out, apparation is seen in book 1, and mentioned in book 2. So, it's always there. The train is the easiest and least conspicuous way of transporting large amounts of wizards who are too young to apparate on their own."

290,E,N,F,P,"Okay, so this may not be the BEST gift I got, but I still loved it and it shows my personality really well:

I'd been hassling my best friend to read this really long fantasy series for a long time, but he never really wanted to commit to it. Well, for my birthday, he shows up with a present for me. I can tell it's a book, and I open it up to find the first book in this fantasy series. I was confused for about a half second before realizing that the gift to me was that he bought the book for himself! Hahaha! And I was so happy with that!"

Embrace it!"
293,E,N,F,P,"In my experience, those people just want to be heard. Most of my friends don't need more than a sounding board, so I listen closely, empathize, and make sure that they know that I know what they're feeling. It doesn't mean I don't offer advice, but I try and separate it from myself so that if they don't follow through, I don't have to take it personally."

I believe that we should also consider what type of person the toxicity is coming from as much as the toxicity itself. Most these people, I’m pretty sure, have some of their underlying issues or perhaps unhealthy mental attitudes, so while this may seem harsh I don’t really feel like giving them credit on their unhealthy,hypocritical opinions.

In my experience ISTPs are like a dog that doesn’t growl. If you keep poking they’ll eventually bite. You may or may not get a warning snap. 

If youve gotten an ISTP to this point, you’ve either done something extreme or it’s been something that has been simmering for a while. Strong, public displays of anger (or any emotion really) aren’t typical ISTP behavior. 

I would rather not get to that point. After I’ve been consistently annoyed by someone that isn’t close to me I’ll start going out of my way to avoid having to deal with them. If they are someone I care about I’ll tell them directly about what it is that I don’t like. Although it may also take a while before I bring it up.

354,I,S,T,P,"Use the MIDI connections on both devices to connect them together. Did a quick image search for the connections available on the Kawai ES8. It looks like it has MIDI IN and Out (DIN connector). The Microfreak also has MIDI In and Out (TRS Connector). 


IIRC the Mircofreak comes with TRS to DIN adapters in the box (They look like headphone connectors with a large round port with 5 slots/holes). All you would need is to get a couple of DIN midi cables that you would connect from the DIN side of the adapters to the ports on your ES8. You just have to make sure that both devices are communicating on the same midi channel. 


Probably the most common reason you'd want to connect these two devices is so you can use one device to control the other. The microfreak has an interesting keyboard for sure, but if you wanted to use your ES8 keyboard to play the MF you could. You would have access to the full ES8 keyboard and wouldn't be limited to just the 2 octaves of keys.

362,I,S,T,P,"Boyfriend is INFJ

This is eerily accurate."
363,I,S,T,P,"Indeed! 

Before discovering what Ni was I would usually ignore these thoughts. Since I had no way of verifying if these conclusions were true I didn’t trust them. They could be useful in providing a path if they were the only conclusions I had. I would then just logically follow the steps that would lead to these conclusions to verify if every step was consistent. Not every Ni insight can be tested however."
364,I,S,T,P,"ISTP here. This is what I can tell you about these functions and how I use them. 

Se. What is observable? If someone tells you something don’t assume, verify it yourself. 

ISTPs can come off as gullible sometimes because if we are paying attention to you then whatever you tell us is what we’re going to be working with. I suck at arguing face to face. If I don’t already know enough about a subject to consider alternatives then I’m going to take everything at face value because I don’t know enough to assume and I would prefer not to assume (Ti/Se preference)


Ti, although technically subjective, desires objectivity. Don’t judge an idea or suggestion as good or bad, but rather as true or false. Even for things that do require you to decide whether something is good or bad consider true or false first. When judging whether something is good or bad such as “is drinking more water good or bad?” My thinking will usually follow something like

Water is good for you
True
Am I already drinking too much water? 
False
Drinking more water right now will be too much water? 
False

Therefor drinking more water is good. 


ISTPs get stereotyped as emotionless, but that’s far from the truth. We have feelings just like everyone else. It’s just that they have to pass the Ti filter before value is placed on these emotions. What is important to me (Fi) is less valued as something to express because I value objectivity (Ti) much more and would rather focus on that. If I conclude that what is important to me is objectively better then I’ll go with that. So even if I went with what is important to me it still has to pass my Ti filter.

I don’t fit the ISTP stereotype. I’ll sometimes question if I am an ISTP since I don’t relate to the silent badass/aloof jerk version often portrayed in memes. If I consider the cognitive functions then things become a little more clear.


I understand that it’s difficult nail down your dominant function. For me, Ti is difficult to really see or pay attention to but if I were to try and describe it I would be like:


Every thought and input goes through a true or false test within. It’s like I have a running tally or list of known truths. Every idea passes through this filter to determine if something is true or false. My other functions come into play when I don’t have enough information to determine T/F. Se will assist by providing information about things as they appear to be and Ni will fill in the blanks and produce an assumption to be tested (although it’s very difficult to explain why this assumption can “feel” so valid) I often don’t trust Ni’s solution but it helps with at least providing a path to either prove it true or false. “I believe it is this! Let me follow and test the steps needed to get there to see if it all holds up.”


Does this make sense?"
367,I,S,T,P,ISTP should be on this list for sure.
368,I,S,T,P,"I think I understand. 

Ni will generate an idea/expectation from the subconscious based on present Se details. This generated idea will color the expectations of the Ni user. 

Si will retrieve a relevant memory and apply a filter based on that memory to the present. The filter will fill in expectations drawn from memory in the present for the Si user. 


Does that fit or am I completely off base here?"

Can you smell something or feel (physical sensation) as you did before? Do these past experiences change your present mood?"

Same thing for writing a summary of what I’ve done throughout the day. Recalling and logging activities performed is also be very mentally draining. 


Maybe it’s just me that’s stuck with this unfortunate paradox. I find personal notes to be very useful for jogging my memory. I also fucking hate taking personal notes."
380,I,S,T,P,"Accurate! 

Although “nice dick” is also acceptable."
381,I,S,T,P,"Could you elaborate on the ISTP one? Not sure I understand. 


I like INTPs for the most part. You guys are always down to dip into whatever I’m interested in and can actually understand what I mean."
382,I,S,T,P,"I hadn’t considered Si and Ne. That does make sense. 


What about Se? Taking in information from direct observation?"
383,I,S,T,P,"Yeah it wasn’t very clear. I think I get what they were trying to get across though. 

Ti wants to know why
Fe is concerned with others(we)


Te wants to know how 
Fi is concerned with its own personal feeling/values(I/me)"
384,I,S,T,P,"I sometimes think about having a routine like this. I’d probably be so productive. 

Then I actually think about having to follow this routine and the idea quickly loses its appeal. It looks good from the outside, but I know I’d be miserable."
385,I,S,T,P,"Spot on! I hadn’t considered these things about Ne. 

You’re right about politics. I don’t have much of an interest in it because political questions don’t usually have concrete answers.


Same with trying to guess what is going on in someone else’s head. I’m pretty good at reading body language, but terrible at predicting how someone will react to something. Makes sense. Body language is immediately observable. 


As for overthinking it. Absolutely. It doesn’t seem immediately useful to me because the possibility of being wrong is so high and being wrong about hunches seems like such a waste of time. I prefer to make predictions on what I already know or can observe and test against. 



Thank you for these insights. I feel like I’ve got a slightly better understanding of Ne. It’s still hard to use tho :P"
386,I,S,T,P,"These are some excellent points. I appreciate the insight. 


You’re absolutely right, I would have little interest in discussing the morality of the treatment of virtual NPCs when my immediate goal is so far from that. 


I’m curious about the inverse of my post. 
As an INTP, what are your pros and cons of dealing with ISTPs?"
387,I,S,T,P,"ISTP male here. This reply will not focus on M vs. F cause I’ve never encountered an ISTP female. 

I personally know 3 INTPs (all males) and get along fairly well with them. 

Pros:

-	Shared dominant Ti. Easy for most conversation to take place. They are one of the few types that will indulge in friendly debate on how things work. I feel comfortable in presenting my side logically without having to adjust the language to be less logic focused. 

-	they are usually pretty easy going and can objectively discuss sensitive topics without getting worked up. For example, while playing the video game Rimworld I wanted to find the best way to get the most out of my growing list of pirate prisoners. A couple of xNFx friends couldn’t get over the inhumane situation that these virtual people were in and thought the idea of trying to get more use out of them to be wrong and not worth trying. My INTP friend had no issues with this situation and we were able to bounce ideas off of eachother. 


-	Low Fe. They also don’t care for small talk and they’re ok if you lose contact with them for a long time. When reuniting we can get right back to where we were without a lot of the additional social etiquette that other types seem to prefer to do when you haven’t seen each other in a while. 

Cons:  

-	They like to take things at their own pace. Oftentimes that pace is toooo slow for me and it can be a bit irritating. 


-	similarly, it’s hard to get them out of their comfort zone. They are always down to discuss new things at length but actually getting things going can be a chore. Before attempting something new they have to know everything about it before they’re willing to try it. 


-	conversations can sometimes go into “what the hell are you talking about?” territory. Usually this will be because they’ve moved on from the original topic and have arrived at something related. That’s not a problem per say but this will usually occur in their minds without ever communicating that to you. So it’s like you’ve missed half of the conversation that they’ve had in their heads and they didn’t bother to catch you up to where they currently are.


Overall I like hanging out with INTPs. They get nerdy and aren’t afraid to show it."
388,I,S,T,P,"Thank you for this tutorial. Very easy to follow. 

What would I need to do to increase the length or give it a little wobble at the end?"
389,I,S,T,P,Reminds me of early Power Rangers for some reason.
390,I,S,T,P,Thank you! An excellent read. I wonder what about it the mods didn’t like?
391,I,S,T,P,Would you happen to know where to find this setting?
392,I,S,T,P,The comment you replied to has been removed. What did it say before?
393,I,S,T,P,"ISTP me: *looks for ISTP on list*

Not mentioned much


Me: aight, cool. Moving on."
394,I,S,T,P,"Not OP but yeah. I’ll usually try and put an effort into replying to whatever request is being made of me. This does require a bit of energy because I have to consider how the other person is feeling and putting social context into place. If it’s a simple question, then I’ll usually respond right away but if my sister texts me something like “Hey guess what mom told me about Patty’s divorce?” I’ll usually wait until I’ve got nothing else going on so I can focus on this conversation that I don’t care to have but don’t want to be completely dismissive about."
395,I,S,T,P,"Always a quality video. Thank you! 

I would love to be able to nudge notes around in a sequence or be able to add or remove steps in the middle of a sequence."
396,I,S,T,P,"Check out this video on YouTube of someone adding effects to a silent track that affects an audible track. Might be what you’re looking for. 


[Silent Parameter Locks](https://youtu.be/fBbZL8vHK4Y)"
397,I,S,T,P,Similar to how they sound when applied to the synths or samples. The FX on the deluge aren’t amazing but they get the job done. It is really cool to have a pedalboard available in a pinch.
398,I,S,T,P,"Yes you can! Another feature that I was blown away by.  You can create an audio track and monitor the 1/4” input Jack. 

I plugged in a guitar directly to the input then plugged the output to an amp. Tested the following effects and they worked: reverb, delay, filter cutoffs, EQ, chorus, phaser, flanger."
399,I,S,T,P,"Absolutely! Once you have your sequence ready you can create a new audio clip in song view and record to it.

While in song view create new audio clip by pressing and holding a blank row. While holding the pad press down the select knob to create an audio clip. Next you can choose the audio input source for this new clip by pressing and holding the learn button + a pad from the audio clip you just created. The new blank clip will be armed to record (red record button should be on). Press play and the unmuted sequence will play. The Deluge will then record from your chosen input (1/4” input or mic). Press the mute/launch pad of the audio clip row to queue a stop to record. Playback and recording will stop at the next loop. You’ll now have an audio clip of the output of the DN."

452,I,N,F,P,My step moms cat follows her around all day and meows like crazy when she leaves. No one could deny how much that cat loves her
453,I,N,F,P,I cant be bothered to watch the show but I still really enjoy the podcast! They sum up the episodes and whatnot but you dont really need to know the plot anyways.
454,I,N,F,P,I have never seen a second of the West Wing but I LOVE listening to people tear media apart so i love the West Wing Thing podcast. It's also very informative from a political standpoint
455,I,N,F,P,I thought the fingers thing was from anime/ cartoons

463,I,N,F,P,To recap: you said you dont like that they look like women and that you go yelled at for saying that. I said that was ignorant. You said you dont like the music or the music video. I'm saying that's fine just dont be ignorant.
464,I,N,F,P,Did you even read my reply lol I specifically said I wasnt saying you did that
465,I,N,F,P,"I'm not saying you have to like them or the music but you have to understand how it comes across when you say a group of asian men look like women. I literally dont care if you don't like the music or video but saying you dont like it and calling it trash are different (not saying you specifically said it trash, just as an example). 

All the fans ask for is to not be shit on by people making fun of yet another thing girls like. We cant enjoy anything ffs."
466,I,N,F,P,Yeah the fans are toxic while you guys are out here calling a group of guys trash ok yeah noted
467,I,N,F,P,Bts fanbase is actually very diverse and more around ages 18-20
468,I,N,F,P,They are not. Dont spout some bullshit that you dont even know about. They literally write their own music
469,I,N,F,P,People call something you're passionate about trash and insult people that we admire and then act shocked when we get mad. And on a fortnite sub of all things. Hypocrites
470,I,N,F,P,Probably because that's an ignorant thing to say lmao
471,I,N,F,P,I get this is just a joke but I'm sick and tired of this kind of thing. Can girls enjoy anything without being made fun of?
472,I,N,F,P,Nah we get pissed when people put us down for liking them or insult the group. People dont have to like them all we ask for is decency.

487,I,N,F,P,Omg I just took my test and this is making me feel way better because I hardly had any SATA even though I did 120 questions. Maybe I do have a chance lol
488,I,N,F,P,This is making me feel better because I test tomorrow and I've only been studying about 1h per day on average for about 6 weeks. I'm glad to hear it's less content heavy because I'm so bad at memorization

503,E,N,T,P,"Sounds like me. I don't have a diagnosis but a suspicion. I always thought that I couldn't have ADHD because I've been so good in school without any problems or work. Maybe I was gifted enough to cover up my ADHD? Idk, I'm confused.

Edit: My best friend and I always had great conversations even if we didn't agree on stuff. I have to admit it can be exhausting with an INFP when they get emotional I guess or don't wanna go out , etc but still. There are different types of INFP, with some it doesn't match perfectly and with some it does. 

So yeah you can find an entp with who it could work haha"
509,E,N,T,P,Would love to hear what an Fi User would say about this.
510,E,N,T,P,Female entp here. Will get tested for ADHD in a few weeks because it is preeetty possible that I have it. I think there are a few personality types that just tend to have ADHD? But especially entps often seem to have it

513,E,N,T,P,Thanks :)

516,E,N,T,P,"Tzank you! A friend now also offered his help although he isn't that good in coding too. I'm still really thankful for that!

I will try out what works best for me. Luckily I don't have to do too complex stuff for now. Just hope that I get into Matlab before we get to the more complex stuff.

Thank you a lot, I appreciate that!!!"
517,E,N,T,P,"Yeaaah you're probably right with this!! 

And thanks for that!!"

519,E,N,T,P,"Thank you! I really need to try to get into it step by step. 

And that's quite interesting! I have to work with meteorological data.

524,E,N,T,P,"""organized"" hahah yeah it's just quite simple :D not so long ago some people started a new sub because they were against rules in an entp subreddit. They just needed to show how much of an entp they are I guess xD"
525,E,N,T,P,Have fun there haha. Also a lot of discussions and stuff about entps there and people that want to understand them haha
526,E,N,T,P,"I can totally understand :D nature as a whole is amazing. Just confused to find them here and not in a specific sub for it. But well seems as if skies are very infp friendly, or aesthetic pictures in general"
527,E,N,T,P,"LOL. I enjoy aesthetic pictures too but not in a mbti sub. You'll mostly find memes in the ENTP sub :D
Also I think sky pictures belong to the most boring aesthetic pictures, they're so common ^^"
528,E,N,T,P,I love INFPs but the amount of aesthetic pictures in this sub confuse me so much

538,E,N,T,P,Why does so much I read about xNxPs just scream ad(h)d?
539,E,N,T,P,Thanks for that comment. Makes sense! I tried agaon and it's sliiiightly scratchable actually.
540,E,N,T,P,Would he interesting knowing what it is. But it's true it's quite smooth and heavy. But I never found a THIS green stone in nature.
541,E,N,T,P,I think I'm an ENTP but I relate way too hard
542,E,N,T,P,"It's completely green, I don't know how to post more pictures. Couldn't scratch it."
543,E,N,T,P,"Oh that's super interesting. Glad you got the diagnosis anyway! 

I'm a bit scared but I think that I can talk with them after the testing again, about the results and how I feel with it. Wish it could all be easy and clear for one damn time 🙄"
544,E,N,T,P,"Thank you:) I'm feeling a little weird now because nothing really has changed and I still need to do so much and just CANT but hey it's the first step and I hope that I will get help and I get the official diagnosis after testing. 

It really is annoying! I was so overwhelmed when talking with her, I could've said so much more and wish I said some things in a different way but I'm still happy that she saw that it really could be adhd. Great that you got your diagnosis too, I hope so much that I can get it too. Just a bit annoying that I'll get tested after all my tests etc. for this semester"
545,E,N,T,P,"Well she just asked what's happened and what's up and stuff and I told her how people said I could have ADHD and that I realize that it could be the reason for a few problems especially since I'm at university since October. She asked a few questions also if I want to medicate. I told her that it's more about the diagnosis itself at the moment and she said that you can start that later when you need it. I told her about a few problems, I probably could have told her more that I'm really struggling, I don't think that I really explained that well. Anyway she meant that the stuff fits to ADHD and something about my intelligence which I didn't understand and it sounded as if it was unsure if the test would show that I have it but if it's no problem and just nice to know that I have it isn't a problem? Anyway I went with my younger sister and there she said she thinks that she has it. We have an appointment in 2 months to test everything (it takes 3 hours!!). 
Well we'll see what the test says. Maybe I'll have to talk with her again because of meds and stuff. 

Just talk about your problems and they will ask some stuff, no problem at all. I was super scared too. I don't have my answers now but at least I don't think I'm dumb anymore for thinking it might be ADHD."
546,E,N,T,P,"Me too. I don't even know if it's the right doc. Never talked to a professional before but he's specialized in ADHD. Still super freaking scared that I go there and he's just like ""what's your problem? Youre just a bit messy"" 
It's dumb but I can't help it. Totally will tell u how it went"
547,E,N,T,P,This is almost one to one my situation. I have a first talk with a doctor in an hour and I'm so freaking scared. I can tell you what he said about it lol.
548,E,N,T,P,"My kindergarten friend was an ESFJ. When I was young I was a pretty quiet girl but as I got older I came out of my shell and argued with here and wanted to discuss things. She hated it. She hated meaningful discussions and said I wouldn't accept her opinion. I just wanted her to explain her opinion because I couldn't understand it (ok also because it often was dumb). 
We took different paths then."
549,E,N,T,P,Omg right! That makes it even cuter!
550,E,N,F,J,Yeah personally I tend to overdo it. I have to actively ask myself if this is my intuition or if I’m simply jumping the conclusions
551,E,N,F,J,"Yes, but it’s also because many people have described me as intimidating when they observed me from afar before getting to know me. So I’m constantly making the effort to initiate conversations and be as warm and friendly as possible bc I don’t like being perceived as intimidating.

Well if you’re genuinely not being clingy, then who gives a shit. If someone’s judgment blocks them from accepting overflowing love and care into their lives, then that’s their loss. Choose someone who’s open-minded and sees people beyond the surface level. Choose people that choose you."
552,E,N,F,J,this is the most enfj post ever and I’m here for it

556,E,N,F,J,"Thank you for this so much. I’m not well-versed when it comes to American movies at all, and my friends kept hyping up Black Swan to me.

I’ve never been so triggered by a movie in my entire life. I really needed this :’)"

558,E,N,F,J,God thank you for this. Needed it more than ever
559,E,N,F,J,uhhhhhhh... wrong sub
560,E,N,F,J,"ENFJ’s tertiary function is Extroverted Sensing so we’re extremely prone to being addicted to sensory pleasures, especially under stress. Lots of ENFJs love their drugs. The more self-disciplined ones are good at instilling that balancing, but the unhealthy ones are definitely one of the most prone to addiction"
561,E,N,F,J,"Love this. I’m a hardcore ENFJ but recently I’ve been questioning it. I love my solitude so much, but I’m extremely sensitive and absorb other people’s feelings way too easily. Quarantine has been making me think I’m actually an introvert, but I wasn’t quite too sure. And my entire personality is filled with a bunch of extreme contrasting dichotomies. This made me feel a lot more confident that I am an ENFJ!"
562,E,N,F,J,"All on my own! But I highly recommend seeking professional help. I consider myself an outlier when it comes to my mental health.

I'm 20F and spent about 10 years of my life SEVERELY depressed which worsened my social anxiety (I'm depression-free now!). I pulled myself out of it without telling a single soul the first \~8 years and never got help. But I do not recommend my way AT ALL. I've tried to take my life more times than I can count on my fingers, and the only thing that stopped me was my greater fear of physical pain.

You also have to factor in that I was depressed and anxious mainly during my adolescence. I didn't have to worry about school, getting a job, paying my bills, etc. I highly doubt I would be able to handle it alone if I were depressed during my entire 20s.

If you can afford to order in Postmates tonight, you can afford to invest in yourself.

I'm personally not the biggest proponent of turning to pills immediately. Of course, there are exceptions, especially if you are on the spectrum. I'm not saying that pills are bad, it's just that I see a lot of people placing pills high on their priority list.

See, you're going to need to work through this no matter what, whether or not you're on the pills. Off the pills, you're going to need to work a lot harder. And that's good. The harder you work, the more you'll learn about yourself. The harder you work, the more your confidence will rise and therefore your results. But of course, if you do think they may be necessary after working on yourself after a few months, then you should consider it. But don't let it be the absolute first thing you turn to. At the end of the day, growth comes from a mindset shift. Pills are simply there to aid you in that journey, not fix things. One day you'll eventually need to learn how to function without the pills. So if it's possible, then start now. Granted, if you're so overwhelmed with your personal responsibilities and/or you genuinely need them, then there is also absolutely no shame in taking them.

I'm not going to assume this is you, but I want to offer you this information just in case. It may not apply directly to you, but perhaps this information could help one of your loved ones one day. If pills are the first thing you want to turn to, it speaks greater volumes of what's going on emotionally deep inside you. It most likely says that you actually see pills as a form of escapism, an easy way out. If this is you, I also want to mention that I am by no means shaming you at all. I've been in this same exact position too, way too many times. Also big pharma prescribes depression and anxiety medicine like it's candy on Halloween. So tread carefully.

Edit: I want to make clear that I'm only talking about depression and anxiety pills. If you have autism, then of course take that treatment."
563,E,N,F,J,"I went from having extreme social anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks just from taking two steps into a room full of strangers. I also had a terrible speech impediment that didn’t help.

Few years later and I’m best known for my confidence, warmth, and social skills. I’ve gotten so many jobs and opportunities just from being socially smooth. Anything is possible!

I think great exercises to get you started is going out for early walks and literally just saying good morning to strangers. Some will happily wave back, some will ignore you. The ignoring is a first step to preparing for inevitable rejection. Hurts at first but then you slowly forget about the negative and focus on the positive interactions.

Also wearing clothes that you make you feel like a badass bitch truly helps. Doesn’t have to be super fancy— it’s all about how you feel in it."
564,E,N,F,J,Wow I love this one! :)
565,E,N,F,J,"it's definitely difficult. realize that if someone's gonna act up when you do something inoffensive then that's 1) an opportunity to strengthen your communication with them and then therefore deepen the relationship 2) you are incompatible with this person and it's completely fine to let go.

If someone cannot nourish my soul, I, in turn, cannot nourish theirs."

567,E,N,F,J,"i dropped acid there in june 2000000/10 experience

it's so large and unsupervised everyone is minding their own business trust me as long as you're not yelling out ""I'M TRIPPING BALLS!"" then you'll be absolutely chill

there's this beautiful gazebo in the most beautiful garden and i was peaking and this deer came down to eat the flowers and we literally hung out alone together for an hour 20000/10 would recommend

plus there are restrooms and a place that serves drinks + food near the entrance

walking all around isn't technically a hike but it's so serene and beautiful and large that it's way better than a hike

but there are a bunch of trails in the back too if you really want to"

577,E,N,F,J,the pain of actually doing it honestly
578,E,N,F,J,"20F ENFJ here. 100% agree with everything. We’re always blown off for being overly idealistic and intense. Instead, we’re seen as childish. I’m learning to let go and not give a fuck. The world will catch up with us eventually."

584,E,N,F,J,"True happiness isn't about feeling good all the time. That's called escapism.

Life is about balancing positive and negative feelings as if they're dancing beautifully. Negative experiences are imperative because they're full of lessons that intensify our positive experiences.

When you fully embrace and genuinely look forward to the darkness, life becomes brighter.

Plus feelings are temporary, but they're so intense that they feel much, much longer."
585,E,N,F,J,What’s dip? I am unfamiliar with the term
586,E,N,F,J,"Wow, I love that! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful quote with me :\~)

I've been dipping my toes into Buddhism, and I stumbled across the quote, ""There is no self.""

A few weeks ago I was really confused by it, but now I understand and fully embrace it.

Currently in life coaching, I'm working on solving my people pleasing behavior and shifting towards focusing solely on myself. I realized that I had no sense of self when I was serving others, for obvious reasons.

But as the focus shifted only on me, I also noticed my sense of self dissolving in the best way ever. I feel like Ditto from Pokemon, able to shift into whatever I want. I'm learning that my sense of self has been boxing me in. All I have are my personality traits that serve as a baseline. They're simply patterns that I most prefer and are most familiar with, but they are by no means defining. I love it so much!"
587,E,N,F,J,"I also believe that absolutely nothing happens after death. It's all about perspective. My belief that nothing occurs after death makes me appreciate the life I do have so much more. It motivates me to work harder and enjoy life so much more!

I'm definitely an optimistic nihilist haha!

Because nothing really matters I have every reason to march to the beat of my own drum."
588,E,N,F,J,I’m honestly really sad seeing Caste on the bottom. I feel like way more people should be reading that one :/
589,E,N,F,J,Still figuring it out but you really have to fix your relationship to things rather than the substances themselves. Because you can quit those things but if you don’t fix your relationship and mentality then that addictive energy will simply manifest itself in other ways in your life

592,E,N,F,J,what
593,E,N,F,J,"ENFJ's tertiary function Se makes us LOVE sensory experiences but because it's in our third slot it's not a well-developed function, so it makes us extra prone to relying heavily on sensory experiences (e.g. drugs) and very prone to addiction (speaking from personal experience)

&#x200B;

I notice that when I'm in a healthy state, I don't think about drugs too much. But boy oh boy when I'm feeling negative, the desire almost consumes me.

&#x200B;

MDMA is definitely a favorite, but I don't turn to it often bc it zaps your brain up.

Cocaine feels way too good for a drug that can easily be laced with fentanyl, so I stay the hell away. It's the only drug where I truly lose control and go on autopilot. I love it, but it's not worth it.

I was addicted to weed, and alcohol was becoming a problem.

I only do psychedelics (e.g. LSD + shrooms) mainly for introspection and to connect back with nature. And it's the only time I'll smoke weed because they pair well together."

619,E,N,F,P,Was a matter of time really.
620,E,N,F,P,"It‘s completely up to you how you interpret it. 

To me, kissing someone else while in a committed relationship is a huge no-go, doesn‘t matter what gender they are. 
Open communication is vital, she could have talked to you first if she were curious or wanted to have some innocent fun with her girlfriends. Personally, I don‘t think I could trust my partner anymore after that, but that‘s just my opinion."
621,E,N,F,P,"The other comments make a lot of good points. I know it‘s not easy, but do yourself a favour and leave him."
622,E,N,F,P,"I feel you, I really do. I am also in a LDR and the last 6 months have, naturally, been quite rough. 

Despite talking to him regularly and feeling extremely happy with him in general, it was hard to feel physically alone. And the worst part - no one knew/knows how much longer the situation will last. The uncertainty makes this difficult situation even more difficult to handle, I am sorry you’re going through it. I don‘t know much about the current situation in North America as we are both in Europe and most borders opened a few weeks ago. 
I finally got to visit him again after over 6 months, and words seriously cannot explain how amazing it was! His presence reminded me again how it was all worth it, that there‘s no one I‘d rather be with - no matter the distance. This painful experience somehow got us closer together as we were „forced“ to be very communicative, vulnerable and appreciative of each other while we were apart for so long. In hindsight, it made our relationship much stronger. 

I suppose what I‘m trying to say is that, although the situation is extremely hard, you‘re not alone and this is temporary. It‘s normal to have doubts, but if she‘s the one for you it will eventually all be worth it and even more amazing once you get to see each other again! Maybe it helps to see it as a test, and if you pass it you‘ll have already gone through a lot as a couple.

That being said, perhaps LDR‘s just aren‘t for you, and that‘s okay. Either way, definitely talk to her about it and let her know about your struggles. You are a team - maybe you can find a solution together. I wish you all the best!

763,E,N,F,P,needed this :/ almost got into a toxic relationship because i was so desperate to feel loved during my depression
764,E,N,F,P,"It’s like you’re drowning but no one can see it. Each day honestly feels like you’re suffocating. You have to battle self-deprecating thoughts and every minute is like a war inside your head telling you that you’re worthless, not good enough, etc. I’m surrounded by people who love me and have a number of great qualities. Regarded as really attractive and talented by everyone I meet. Yet I struggle with suicidal ideation every day. It hurts so much to be alive yet I don’t want to die.

I have depression and anxiety, so when I’m not sad, I am constantly worrying. I feel stressed and upset nearly every second of the day. The most ironic part about all of this is that I am known as being really happy by all of my friends. They describe me as being really bubbly, nice, and full of sunshine. I am sad every day, and sometimes I just lose the energy to put up the act. I can’t stand the thought of having to live like this for the rest of my life because I know that there’s no cure.

Having this paired up with anxiety has its own pros and cons."

766,E,N,F,P,these are typically anywhere from 1-3 years. i can’t help but feel pangs of jealousy every time i hear about someone else’s relationship or see couples in public. i just want to be good enough for someone. your advice sounds a lot like my parents’ and i appreciate it a lot. i just find it very hard to believe though because i don’t have any past experience of any guy ever genuinely wanting to be with me.

779,E,N,F,P,and I don’t get offended easily so do you think you could elaborate on why someone in a conservative area wouldn’t want an Indian? I’ve always wondered this
780,E,N,F,P,i get that. how do you guys feel about hispanics? or asians (not including indians)
781,E,N,F,P,"As an Indian girl, I agree with this. It’s not that they will completely rule out the idea of dating you but there’s the possibility that depending on where you are, let’s say a very conservative area, they may have prejudice against you. I’ve been there, and purposely moved to somewhere much more diverse and had a better experience. Hope everything works out! Maybe specify on your dating apps that you’re interested in interracial dating."
782,E,N,F,P,"i understand, i know several people who think the same way but at least you’re acknowledging that it’s wrong. just out of curiosity, how do people in those types of communities feel about Indian women? is it the same? brutal honesty appreciated because i’m curious"
783,E,N,F,P,"you realize ruling out an entire population strictly because of their race isn’t just preference, it’s racist right?"
784,E,N,F,P,"it’s also about confidence. i get regarded as really attractive by everyone I meet but I have really bad self-esteem issues rooted in childhood trauma which makes me feel not good enough and unlovable, so why even try. I’ve seen below-average guys get with really attractive girls because of their personality."

801,I,N,T,P,You might check in with [u/Bobbybroccole](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bobbybroccole/). They [posted on here a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jon_Bois/comments/h9j9fl/looking_for_a_bit_of_help_reverseengineering_jons/) that they had done some experimenting with reproducing Jon's style and they were thinking about making a tutorial.
802,I,N,T,P,I'm also an INTP (male) in a relationship with an INFJ (female); we just celebrated our 1-year wedding anniversary :-)
803,I,N,T,P,"This is an interesting idea for research, especially as I think open-ended surveys are comparatively rare in the MBTI space.  However, if you want this to give you an accurate picture of what the types are like, be careful with stating your hypotheses to the people you're trying to elicit information from. I'm referring to this sentence:

>I have heard that INTJs often have trouble starting things, but (generally) proceed to finish without delay.  

Just by mentioning this you prime your audience to think about this idea making it more likely they will mention it--possibly even more likely to agree with it--resulting in biased results."
804,I,N,T,P,"Glad that what I wrote resonated with you :-) To clarify, did you mean this paragraph?

> I know people who cannot help getting engulfed in their emotional  flames...

If so, by ""Fi tak\[ing\] over"" did you mean *Fi takes over to comfort other people in a distressed time*, or *Fi takes over and you get caught up in emotions*?"
805,I,N,T,P,"I have some thoughts about ""Facts don't care about your feelings"" (FDCAYF). 

While I agree with the statement, I think it has a bad implication, namely: ""Facts don't care about your feelings *and neither do I*."" In a world where it's a fact that 1) people care about having their emotions\* acknowledged and 2) resent having them dismissed, then one ignores them at their own peril. 

I know people who cannot help getting engulfed in their emotional flames; some can even recognize that that is what's happening in real-time but cannot stop it. Thus, to say FDCAYF to such a person will likely only make them feel worse that they lacked the self control to prevent getting caught up in their emotions; it will make them feel ashamed. Better to take a gentler approach and make them feel reassured and comforted with listening and kind words and then, when they're in a better headspace, one can start exploring solutions. In other words, put the fire out before trying to catch the arsonist. 

\*As an aside, FDCAYF also seems to classify the person's feelings as something other than ""facts"". But aren't their feelings facts? Their feelings are almost surely entangled with the other facts of the situation, at least as they perceive them. So there is likely some rational basis for the emotion, even if one thinks the intensity is overblown."
806,I,N,T,P,"I'd agree with others that said the regional curves are the main story, but, aesthetically, I really like how you fit the elements into the window of the main stacked plot. The three separate plotting elements--regional curves, stacked counts, and stacked proportions--give different emphasis to the information and helps paint a clearer picture. If you had only included the regional curves, then it'd be hard to tell exactly what proportion of cases could be attributed to each region, which the stacked proportions makes clearer. But even with the stacked proportions and regional curves, it would be hard to tell if total cases had reached a second peak, so the stacked count plot helps to answer that question.

Also, nice choice of color scheme; ever since I downloaded ColorOracle, it's been my hobby to check graphics to see if they're user-friendly for the vision-impaired folks. Yours checks out well."
807,I,N,T,P,"Damn, I enjoyed that; love the style. What moved you to animate this song?"
808,I,N,T,P,"I don't have a lot of experience with it yet, but I explain my current setup (which is working very well so far) in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/hbeixz/xnxp/fv8xgbu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) reply"
809,I,N,T,P,"Basically, I've used it to leverage social pressure to make me do something I need to do/want to do but have put off. First, you decide on a goal, like my current one which is ""reach out to two people each day to extend or maintain my professional network"". Then, you decide on the stakes: they can be financial, social, or both. Finally, you make periodic reports on your goal progress. If you are meeting your goal, great! If you are failing your goal, you lose whatever you put up as the stakes. 

If you choose financial stakes, you put up some money that will be taken from you if you fail. Failure is determined by your own reporting, which means that it's all too easy to lie.

For this reason, I recommend using social stakes. The basic version is to add ""supporters"" who get notified of your updates and they can make comments on your commitment journal. The advanced version is to add a ""referee"" who has the ability to override\* your report if you haven't provided evidence that you met the goal.  Note that, if you don't have any financial stakes as well, all you ""lose"" here is potentially some of your supporters' regard, i.e., they'll know that you failed. 

The most effective, for me, is to use both financial and social stakes. The social stakes alone might be enough, but you can add increased pressure by having the financial stakes be given to a charity that you and your supporters dislike. For example, in the goal I mentioned at the start, if I fail to contact two people on a given day, I will lose $35 and that money will go to the National Rifle Association. I made my goal for 28 days, so, at the start, I had the possibility of losing $980. My wife knows that I made this goal and she would be extremely upset if I gave any money to the NRA. This makes for strong motivation to succeed. 

Lastly, the extreme nature of the commitments you can make is something that I find amusing to explain to others, which is another source of motivation. The service is free to use, so I recommend giving it a try. 

\*Importantly, the if the referee fails to make a judgment during the reporting period, the app will trust your report. This is good because you don't want to fail because the ref was negligent. On the flip side, this means you need to select a diligent ref."

However, aren't these the percentages rather than the proportions? That is, for the US, the infected rate as a proportion is about 600,000/330,000,000 = 0.0018. Thus, as a percentage it would be 100 x 0.0018 = 0.18%, as in the viz."

817,I,N,T,P,"Nice, I'd be curious to see more details as well.

With regard to the reliability/validity of MBTI, I found a nice [assessment](https://shop.themyersbriggs.com/pdfs/MBTI_FormM_Supp.pdf) which compares the MBTI to other personality tests (it seems to compare favorably). Though, it does appear that it was conducted by the people who administer the MBTI test, so a bit of a conflict of interest there."

820,I,N,T,P,"Ah, quite right. This had occurred to me, but I got distracted by trying to figure out why none of the function probabilities from the IDRLabs tests were complimentary. Could someone score 100% (or 0%) for all categories? If one person scores 10% higher than someone else for all categories, what does that mean? 

Anyway, you're absolutely right and I think it would be simple to implement. Thanks for reminding me."
821,I,N,T,P,"Sounds like you're using 16 personalities, which uses binary distinctions by each letter. Thus, if your P preference is typically weak (near to 50%), then getting a J this time would be understandable, as we don't answer the questions exactly the same every time (unless you've memorized the test lol)."
822,I,N,T,P,"I think it's debatable how much of the pasture land could be used to produce crops (would love to see an estimate\* of that), but what's not up for debate is the large area next to it for livestock feed could go a long way feed people. Even if 100% of the cow pasture/range area couldn't be farmed (seems unlikely to me though), the livestock feed area is almost twice as large as the ""food we eat"" area. 

\*I could only find this vague statement, ""Grazing lands generally are less suited for crop production than for other uses."" ([source](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2012/march/data-feature-how-is-land-used/)). On a perhaps positive note, the source also reports that pasture land decreased from over 1 billion acres to 724 million acres from 1949 to 2007."
823,I,N,T,P,"Hmm, I did not think about this, but I have heard the idea before. I'm wondering how to distinguish between Ni + Te inflating Ti and Ti inflating Ni + Te? In your example, do you say Ti is inflated because Ni and Te scored higher than Ti? If so, then I could add another switch to the calculator for ""inflated Ti"", but I couldn't only reduce Ti, I would also have to increase some other function's probability as I'm assuming they will all sum up to 100%.

As an aside, what you propose is somewhat against the spirit of the resources I drew on in making this calculator, which seek to move away from strongly interpreting the cognitive functions or even using them at all (see [OddlyDevelopedTypes](http://www.oddlydevelopedtypes.com/content/cognitive-functions-and-type-dynamics-failed-theory)). Though, I did muddy the waters by using the names of the cognitive functions. Anyway, I was trying to bridge the gap and have the ""cognitive functions"" just be conditional preferences. Thus, Ne and Ni are not fundamentally different forms of intuition in this framework, they are just one's tendency to use intuition while focused on external world vs the internal world (respectively)."
824,I,N,T,P,"Thanks for reporting your results. I've tried converting the results into probabilities (as in the calculator), but haven't got satisfactory results yet. It's hard to know how to interpret their scale beyond comparing the size of the numbers. I'm also surprised to see they allow the individual letter scores to be negative."
825,I,N,T,P,"I always find validity discussions interesting and this was no exception.

>If you admit that the provenance of the theory doesn’t necessarily  preclude it from being valid then you are left with what I would argue  is the more important question, is this a valid psychological theory or  not?

Beautifully stated. I agree that to argue that the source of the idea matters (in terms of demographics of the person who generated the idea) is a bad move. Better to refute the idea on its own terms.

The Psychology Today article you reference was fine, in theory, but that first link (Personality, Self-Efficacy, and Attachment styles) provides little evidence of the MBTI's validity. Though it is only a PowerPoint presentation and we can expect it to be less detailed than a published study, much important information is left out: who where the people being studied (looks like this was intended to be added on slide 11)? How did they enter the study? The only reliability estimate they use is Cronbach's alpha which is a measure of *internal consistency*, that is, if you only give the respondents half of the questions, how similar do you expect their score to be on the other half? Thus, there is no estimate of the *test-retest reliability*, that is, if you gave the respondents the same test at a different time, how similar do you expect their scores to be? I believe the latter is more important here as the scales are already rather short (6 questions for each of the 8 functions) and it seems like all respondents got the whole test anyway. That said, the internal consistency for most of the functions were between 0.61 (questionable) and 0.75 (acceptable) with one scale at 0.85 (good). But, that was reliability, what of the validity? In the regression analysis part, they boast some large R^(2) values (0.42 is quite high for psychology research, in my experience), but did they control for other variables like age, gender, or depression? And, even if they did, do the findings align with what is expected by type theory? To answer that, we'd need to know how cognitive functions would relate with the study's outcome measures: attachment type and self-efficacy. I have no idea how we'd expect those measures to relate with the cognitive functions, thus, if we have no predictions to corroborate, we can only make do with explaining observations. They observed that Te, Ni, and Se were positively correlated with self-efficacy while Si and Fe were negatively related. Were these relations statistically significant?\* I don't know, these details were omitted. Does it make sense for Te, Ni, and Si to be positively related with self-efficacy (as measured by a modified version of the Generalized Self-efficacy Scale)?

Your third linked article is a secondary source, i.e., a thesis which mentions a paper that is using Jungian typology to develop artificial entities. The primary source is linked in the PsychToday article, [Neubauer (2004)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1040231.1040269). In it, they decide to use a reduced version of type theory, omitting the ""non-rational"" human functions of intuition and feeling and altered definitions of introversion and extraversion. Thus, as this paper is only using type theory and not directly assessing its validity I'm not sure how much we can use this paper to strengthen the case for type theory's validity. But, it does show that some researchers in other domains think type theory is an avenue worth pursuing.

I'm still working through the second study on ADHD and the cognitive functions, but it appears to be an unfinished manuscript and does not have any of the tables referenced in the text.

I would like to get to the other studies, but, alas, it is late and I must sleep. At any rate, thanks for the entertainment.

\*as an aside, too much emphasis is put on statistical ""significance"" because it is easy to assess. But too many still misinterpret it; recently [Zieffler, Harring, and Long (2011)](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891570487&origin=inward&txGid=726d346e9138596a6b5e4344a637ca8d) proposed opting for ""statistically reliable"" phrasing instead, which I think better conveys the p-value's meaning. Furthermore, such emphasis on statistical significance means researchers spend less time on on more important things, like reliability and validity of measures, carefully controlling recruitment of participants, identifying the possible confounding variables, and having one (or more) relevant control groups. /rant

Edit: as an aside, I found a [cognitive function test](https://www.idrlabs.com/cognitive-function/test.php) earlier today that appears to be similar to the one used in the study on Attachment and Self-efficacy. At least, it has the same number of items (48)."
826,I,N,T,P,"To be honest, I'd likely have done it outside of quarantine too it just would've taken longer lol"
827,I,N,T,P,"Ah, yes, I have a similar pattern in my results, but it's all the introverted functions in the top 5, with Ne and Fi switched in the middle.

Noticing this pattern was part of what spurred me to add the switches to the calculator, as I realized the pattern could be changed by relaxing the equality constraints between EJ/IJ, Ne/Ni, etc."
828,I,N,T,P,"Ah, yes, sorry to be unclear. You understand correctly: by summing Ne+Ni+Se+Si you should recover the original P score (or, in probability terms, you could call it the ""marginal"" P score)."
829,I,N,T,P,"Wow, I didn't expect anyone to actually have such a strong preference, haha. Though, having such a strong introverted preference appears to make your results relatively more certain (i.e., they don't change much with the switches).

And, yes, I found my strong Ni preference interesting as well, given my affiliation with the INTP type. But, that is part of the reason I embarked on this enterprise. Now I'm learning about the different theories regarding how the functions might be ordered, though, I do like the idea of having personalized orderings."
830,I,N,T,P,"Ah, I see, thanks. I was just curious.

As for a possible bias, is your perceiving preference 79%? If so, then the sum of the perceiving functions should also be 79%. If not, then there would appear to be an issue."
831,I,N,T,P,"Thanks for your comment! And I wish you well with sMath; it looks like a nice, open-source program. What do you normally use it for?"
832,I,N,T,P,">Is there a way to reverse the process - going from a set of function processes to a likely set of dichotomies? 

Oh, that is an interesting question and one that did not occur to me. I guess it would be related with my discussion under the ""Reproducing the MBTI stacks"" section of the post. Thus, to achieve the MBTI ENTJ stack, I would guess you need weak E preference, weak-to-moderate J preference, weak-to-moderate N preference, moderate-to-strong T preference, and the switches set to EJ > IJ, Ne < Ni, and Te > Ti. I'll try those settings later and see what I get, but if you try it first, let me know."

Therefore, one of these two statements, ""generalizations, generally, don't work"" or ""generalizations, generally, do work"" is true. So, we can conclude that one exception to the ""don't generalize"" rule would be: ""generalizations about generalizations work""."
835,I,N,T,P,"Interesting idea to ask people who have already been typed to describe themselves. I'd expect the answers to match the type descriptions, on average. 

Anyway, if you need help analyzing/summarizing the data, I can help with that."
836,I,N,T,P,"For me, it was the lesser of two evils, if I plot without the NAs, then the x- and y-axes have different groups of letters because not every letter is represented in the first and second spots. But, if that's acceptable to you, here is the alternative plot (with aspect ratio changed to be square):

837,I,N,T,P,"Inspired by this post, I made a heatmap of the state abbreviation letters. First letter on y-axis, second letter on x-axis:

[https://imgur.com/a/fZS7LPx](https://imgur.com/a/fZS7LPx)

The most popular letter is A, with 12 appearances overall, followed by N with 11. B and Q do not appear in any state abbreviation. Biggest difference in use for first vs second letter is M, which is used 8 times as a first letter, but only 1 time as a second letter. No state has a double-letter abbreviation (e.g., AA)."

839,I,N,T,P,Nice find
840,I,N,T,P,"I'm not OP but, as best as I can tell, the origin is a t-shirt from ReverbCity, a Brazilian music merch website:

[https://www.reverbcity.com/camiseta-tame-impala-backwards-masculino-p349](https://www.reverbcity.com/camiseta-tame-impala-backwards-masculino-p349)

I suspect the posted picture comes from this page, as it is the exact same resolution and has the faint grey box around the art:

[https://images.tcdn.com.br/img/img\_prod/722594/camiseta\_tame\_impala\_backwards\_masculino\_437\_2\_20191010200704.jpeg](https://images.tcdn.com.br/img/img_prod/722594/camiseta_tame_impala_backwards_masculino_437_2_20191010200704.jpeg)

Naturally, ReverbCity may have gotten the design from elsewhere, but they say that all their designs are original and not re-productions. And, looking at other examples of their shirts, this kind of design featuring song lyrics is typical of their style. Here's another shirt of theirs featuring Tame Impala's ""Mind Mischief"":

[https://www.reverbcity.com/camiseta-tame-impala-mind-mischief-masculino-p204](https://www.reverbcity.com/camiseta-tame-impala-mind-mischief-masculino-p204)

You can't tell when the shirt was first posted from the link above, but I looked on their Instagram and found this post from August 2013 to be the oldest post referencing the design:

[https://www.instagram.com/p/de8h\_Wlkep/](https://www.instagram.com/p/de8h_Wlkep/)

As the ""Backwards"" single was released in October 2012, this leaves about 10 months of time between the single's release and the Instagram post. Could someone else have designed the art earlier and this website took it? Possibly, but I have no evidence of that so far.

Sadly, it seems they do not appear to credit artists individually, so I couldn't figure out who specifically designed the shirt."
841,I,N,T,P,"It's interesting to see that, with these age groupings, the fatality rate is approximately exponential. That is, starting with the 30-39 age group, the fatality rate doubles (roughly) as you increase to the next age group. This seems to hold across countries."
842,I,N,T,P,Cool visualization. I replied to another comment in this thread with some questions and it'd be great if you could provide some clarity about how the image was generated.
843,I,N,T,P,"I've been puzzling over this as well. Things don't line up as I would expect, given the description. 

First, I had assumed that, if OP used 2300 digits then there should be 2300 dots, however, there are clearly more than that: the shortest line of dots (going from the middle circle outwards) appears to be the 5th line in the light-green ""three"" segment. There are 36 dots in this line. There are 10 lines in each of the 10 segments, so, if every segment had 36 dots then there would be 3600 dots total. But, this is a lower bound because I used the shortest line, so there are clearly more than 3600 dots total. 

Second, my understanding is that each segment of the inner circle represents the ""previous decimal"". I also thought that, since the numbers in the inner circle (0 - 9) proceed clockwise, so too would the numbers within each segment. So, I put the digits of pi into R and found the first 10 decimals of pi that are preceded by a 1: ""4"" ""5"" ""9"" ""6"" ""0"" ""6"" ""1"" ""7"" ""4"" ""3"". But this does not correspond with the first row of values in the light-blue ""one"" segment, which are (going clock-wise): 6 4 7 5 1 7 0 9 6 0, nor any of the rows for that matter. Nor does it correspond with the first or last 10 digits of any of the 10 lines in that segment.

Third, I'm not sure what to make of the statement in the description that, ""its position is its position in π"". Does this just mean that the dots are placed sequentially as they are in pi? Does it mean that the coordinate of the dot is related with its position (i.e., the 338th decimal)? 

I'm assuming I made some faulty assumptions about how the dots were placed or perhaps there is some randomization involved (but it sounds like there isn't). 

Long story short: I'm pretty stumped, so hopefully OP can clarify."
844,I,N,T,P,"I was classified as near the ""High Accuracy"" end of both spectrums ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/0Fw3xZQ)). As for the averages, I'm not surprised that most people do better on the relative judging task compared to the absolute judging task.

Edit: I should add that I essentially turned the absolute task into a relative one by comparing the length of the line to my mouse cursor, which may be considered cheating. Oh well."
845,I,N,T,P,"Nice aesthetic; how much does a setup like this cost? Also, I notice that you have what appears to be a landline phone. Do you find it much of a benefit?"
846,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. If you want to build a algorithm/machine that allows you deduce what is ""right"" and ""wrong"" that machine will require assumptions as fuel to get started. And there is no way I can see to deduce those assumptions from nothing. 

I would say that we're all just doing what we want to do and that's always irrational at some level (i.e., not justifiable). If other people/things don't like what you're doing, they will try to stop you or put up wit it. If you don't like things other people/things are doing, then you will try to stop it or put up with it. I suppose you could call the average of these actions across humans ""morality"", but only in a descriptive (rather than prescriptive) sense. 

This is not to say that ethical systems have no use. It may be that your preferences are well-captured by an existing ethical system, like utilitarianism, which is nice because it may clarify your own thinking on the subject and make it easier to communicate your preferences to other people."

849,I,N,T,P,"I'm not sure about the details, but I just came across\* this visualization tool called Flourish, which has the ability to do [network charts](https://flourish.studio/visualisations/network-charts/) that visualize links between nodes in a network (i.e., in your case, working together (links) between people (nodes) on different kinds of projects (color of node)).

852,E,N,T,P,"I‘m really not a hardcore shipper but this ending for Bellamy sucks. I could totally live with him dying a sacrifice either alone or with Clarke, but their relationship was the core of the show and it wasn‘t recognized at all after S6. Seriously, Jason screwed up there.

853,E,N,T,P,"yeah...both killed in norway, both likely german/central european origin, removal of labels, no clue to the real identity...and both suspected to be involved in some spy business."
854,E,N,T,P,"Maybe there wasn‘t any family left? She could be an only child and an orphan, that‘s not completely unlikely. That‘d explain why noone came forward because noone would miss her.

855,E,N,T,P,"Cleaned up everything in 15 minutes?
Tbh if they didn‘t go all „it‘s a suicide“, they could have checked for other things. On what distance was shot? If this was foul play, it was likely that the distance doesn‘t fit in line with a self induced headshot due to suicide. They looked for finger prints, but how about hair or skin particles from other persons? DNA wasn‘t a thing back there sadly. They also should use a genealogy DNA bank. How about the teeth, any fillings that can be traced back?"
856,E,N,T,P,"true, my boyfriend was already half asleep yesterday and just heard norway and missing labels and he was like „I know this case already!“ and he thought it was about Isdal. I said no, it happened twenty years later, but you may be right, there are some similarities. Also funny that both women may have a german origin. The spy theory sounds not unlikely...
I was like 100% suicide or killing on demand, but then they talked about positioning about the weapon, literally nothing personal, missing labels in clothes, etc and then I knew this doesn‘t match up. I wonder why they didn‘t try to do a picture of „Lois Fairgate“, maybe he has a connection to that Belgian town and someone saw him around there. I also believe that town wasn’t choose at random, this were times were google maps and random adress generators weren‘t probably a thing, so they maybe thought of a place they knew already."

913,I,S,T,P,Thank you for being a great boyfriend and choosing to stay with your girlfriend :)
914,I,S,T,P,"Sounds kind of harsh, but I agree with you. The more I read his post, the more I feel like OP is the problem here. He doesn't realize how lucky he is to have a girlfriend who he can connect with deeply and who doesn't mind that he devotes almost all his time to work. I know so many people who want attention from their partner all the time and wouldn't be able to handle that. Instead of appreciating his girlfriend, he's already thinking about finding a new girl on Tinder to have sex with. The fact that he's even considering the option of staying roommates with his girlfriend while he brings new girls home makes him sound extremely **selfish** and **cruel**. He's thinking of using his girlfriend as a backup option in case new relationships don't work out for him. His girlfriend deserves **much** better than that.

Take some time off work, plan some fun activities to do with your girlfriend and pay more attention to her. Maybe then she will want more physical contact with you."
915,I,S,T,P,"Is it that weird? When my boyfriend and I buy different flavours of ice cream and he wants to try my flavour, I feed some to him. When he’s driving during a long car ride and gets hungry, I would feed him snacks. These kinds of situations happen pretty often and I don’t find it very unusual."
916,I,S,T,P,"I agree! OP, try to show her you care and appreciate her in other ways. Instead of finding faults in her and wanting her to change, see what *you* can do to improve your relationship. 

My ex actually had the same complaint about me that you have with your girlfriend; he had to initiate physical contact with me almost 100% of the time and felt like I was emotionally closed off towards him. He told me I acted like a robot. And how did I perceive him? I thought he was the one being emotionally closed off towards me and didn’t care about me enough. 

In hindsight, we were just incompatible because we had vastly different ways of showing affection. I did not feel comfortable initiating physical contact with him because I didn’t feel like he cared for me or loved me enough. He didn’t understand/couldn’t give me what I wanted in the relationship and I couldn’t give him what he wanted in his.

I have no problems at all initiating physical contact with my current bf because he makes me feel loved and comfortable."
917,I,S,T,P,"Came here after seeing your post on r/relationships. 

To be honest, I think you’re pretty lucky to find someone like her. It sounds like you really get along with each other and have a lot in common. She sounds very independent and low maintenance. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side and you might regret it later if you break up with her.

Try not initiating sex for a while and see how long it takes/whether or not she initiates. Maybe she’s shy about initiating? I read in a comment that one Redditor was shy about initiating sex, so she and her partner came up with the idea of using a hair accessory as a signal. Whenever she was in the mood, she would wear that hair accessory. You could try something like that with your girlfriend. 

Tell her that this is a big issue for you and you might consider ending the relationship if she doesn’t change and see if she will make an effort."
918,I,S,T,P,"I think you should realize that people are different and not everyone puts a lot of importance on physical contact and sex in a relationship. I don’t think it necessarily has anything to do with autism. 

In your post, it kind of sounds like you’re accusing her of being “abnormal” and thinking she has autism just because she doesn’t enjoy physical contact as much as you do. Neither of you are normal or abnormal in my opinion, just different. Personally, I think other aspects of a relationship are more important than physical contact and I would love having my partner also be my best friend. That is much better to me than finding a partner who you only enjoy having sex but otherwise have nothing in common with. 

Also, a lot of women are socialized/taught to let guys take the initiative when it comes to stuff like physical contact, and it might be hard to break this habit. You have to figure out if this is a dealbreaker for you. If you decide to break up, I suggest moving out. Dating another girl while you still live with your ex is unfair to both your ex and your new girlfriend. I would never date someone who was still living with their ex."
919,I,S,T,P,"I don’t see anything wrong with it... My boyfriend and I feed each other sometimes and I find it really sweet/cute to do that.

Edit: I wouldn’t do something like that in public, in front of my friends though. That does seem a little weird lol."

Then I watched it again in high school and was really impressed. I think you have to be more mature to understand and appreciate Studio Ghibli’s films.
925,I,S,T,P,I really like him!
926,I,S,T,P,"I totally agree with you. When you love someone, you will care about what makes them happy. Just because you don’t care about gift giving doesn’t mean your partner doesn’t. It’s the same with choosing a gift for someone - you shouldn’t choose something that you want as a gift, but something that the gift receiver wants. It’s about the other person. Those people who say they don’t get gifts because special occasions aren’t special to them sound self-centred."
927,I,S,T,P,"I think you’ll just be able to tell when someone loves you. They will remember the things you tell them, your likes and dislikes, and do things for you to make you feel special. They will accept you for who you are, listen to you and respect your feelings, and be supportive of your choices. They will be there for you when you need them."
928,I,S,T,P,"Gift giving is a way to show you love and care about your partner. I think what she wants isn’t the *gift*, what she wants is something to show her that he *cares*. Besides, he already told her that he was going to make it up to her for not getting something for her birthday. He shouldn’t have promised if he wasn’t going to follow up on it."
929,I,S,T,P,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting a gift from your partner on your birthday. He promised that he was going to celebrate her birthday with her and didn’t just because they had an argument. Instead, he left and ruined what should’ve been her special day. He could’ve at least done something for her to make up for it after they made up."
930,I,S,T,P,"OP said it was more about a lack of effort rather than an expensive present. If he was tight on money, he could’ve just given her a card or a handmade present. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for her to want a present from him. Gift giving might not be important to some people, but it can be important to others."
931,I,S,T,P,Can’t believe the number of people who think guys don’t give gifts. Isn’t it normal to expect gifts from your partner on special occasions?
932,I,S,T,P,Are you saying that he can’t give gifts because he’s a guy?
933,I,S,T,P,"I just graduated from university and started working last year. I’m not making very much, but I can still save ~40% of my (after tax) income without much difficulty. I don’t think it’s too difficult to save some money if you’re frugal with spending.

That being said, housing costs are high and cost of living keeps increasing. It will take several more years of saving before I can afford down payment on a house."
934,I,S,T,P,I just went to read your last post after I saw this one. Good on you for breaking up with him!
935,I,S,T,P,"OP said that getting a gift for her birthday was important to her. The fact that her bf just left after an argument and didn’t bother doing anything for her birthday shows that he doesn’t care about her enough. If he was sincere about making up, he should make more of an effort. It is not enough to just be together, both partners need to put effort into the relationship."
936,I,S,T,P,"Move to EQ Bank, they have 1.7% interest rate. You can also get $20 when you open an account with EQ using a referral code. I can refer you if you want."
937,I,S,T,P,You got it right 😃

941,I,S,T,P,I was super scared of Gaara from Naruto when I first watched the chunin exam arc to the point that I couldn’t sleep at night.
942,I,S,T,P,"I think I was pretty much at the recommended level for default VI. The first time I fought the arch-illager, I died before even getting to the heart of ender lol. Then I defeated the heart of ender on my last life on my second try."
943,I,S,T,P,I gave something to my bf and he gave me something back. We were around the same power level (~110) and both of the items we got increased in level when they were gifted.
944,I,S,T,P,I use an archer build with a harp crossbow. This wasn’t too bad with 2 fireworks arrows and 1 flaming quiver.
945,I,S,T,P,Redstone Mines today had so many enchanted pillagers shooting arrows. A couple hits and I was dead 😬
946,I,S,T,P,"Took me like 4 tries to beat the Redstone Mines one today. I normally don’t use a soul build, but I switched to a soul build for this trial because you get 5x the souls. I paired torment quiver with my harp crossbow and it worked pretty well!"
947,I,S,T,P,You can kill them with fireworks arrows.
948,I,S,T,P,"NTA.

They asked for dowry, you should ask for bride price. In my culture, a lot of men can't even get married if they don't put a house and a car under the bride's name."
949,I,S,T,P,There’s a mask bylaw... People should’ve called the police on her; she should be fined for not wearing a mask.

984,E,N,F,P,Cloud Atlas. Massive mind fuck despite not knowing what was going on half the time 
985,E,N,F,P,By first loving oneself beyond one's flaws
986,E,N,F,P,I think introverts tend to bottle up their emotions a lot more.  They often feel that they have to deal with their emotions or problems on their own and therefore hold on to the hurt or anger or frustration within.
987,E,N,F,P,"Sleeping pills, benzos, anti depressants etc. its easy to get anything from a private doctor. "
988,E,N,F,P,"None whatsoever, although i find that the trips themselves can be very painful at times, as they as they often force one to come face to face with a lot of negative attributes about oneself which are often repressed into the subconscious. It's unbelievably healing. I treat mushrooms with a great amount of respect. I don't see them as recreational. "
989,E,N,F,P,I take 50mg of Sertraline daily and my mushroom experience was absolutely amazing. It does however seem to nullify the effects of LSD and MDMA.
990,I,N,F,P,"I'm sorry for misunderstanding so badly, but your explanation didn't do justice to severity of the situation.  It sounds like you are a victim of abuse, with lasting trauma and psychological damage.  This goes well beyond what I, or the average redditor can help you with.  You need help, preferable from professionals and others like yourself who know what you've been through.

I wish you the best and hope you find what you need to be healthy and happy."
991,I,N,F,P,"I've reread the OP and I *think* I understand?  But a sheltered childhood as I understand my own does not prevent you from being an adult.  It just makes it harder because you lack certain experiences during a time where integrating them into your self might have been easier.

First of all, completely rid yourself of the notion that all adults are put together and know what they're doing.  We don't.  That's the goal, and the only way to get there is to survive until we've got the experience to do better.  How to survive?  Use what know, ask questions or look for guidance where you don't.   Truly, that's the secret.  If you see another adult who looks like they know what they're doing, they're either faking it till they make it, or they've already made it and got a lot of experiences under their belt.

Also...the panic?  Having fears and uncertainties is normal.   Panic less so, but that's still a normal response to feeling like you've lost control.  What to do?  Take that control back.  How?  The most obvious way to me is to approach it as you would have had you grown up the way you wanted.  Go through the milestones.  What situations would you have wanted to experience growing up and in what order?  Who would you have sought for advice doing these things?  Take that, think about what you've got to work with now, and make em happen as you can."
992,I,N,F,P,"I think part of your problem is you're making some incorrect assumptions.  Being an adult doesn't mean killing your inner child.  It doesn't mean having to sacrifice everything all the time.  It means being mature enough to make the hard choices and sacrifices when necessary.  And it means knowing when you need to take care of yourself.

The other part of your problem I feel you've pegged correctly though.  It sounds like you've missed important milestones in transitioning to adulthood.  You may not be able to go back in time, but you can and should make time to get in touch with the part of you that got cut off when you had to grow up so quickly...and reconnect.  It doesn't have to be an unhealthy thing, but it does need to be a mindful process and you may need to get help in doing it.

As for how to cope beyond that?  Once you've got a healthy connection with your inner child again, just make time for the things that nourish that connection and bring you back to yourself.  It's one of many reasons why alone time and hobbies are so important.  It's time to breathe and just *be*."
993,I,N,F,P,I have an artistic soul.  Does that count?
994,I,N,F,P,Because it's fun?
995,I,N,F,P,"Because it makes for good PR.  How else are we Americans supposed to feel good about ourselves and place a rather obvious lampshade on our past and present misdealings than by pretending that we're all the things we really aren't?

Truly though, I'm with you.  It's ridiculous."
996,I,N,F,P,"I don't know what fantasy this is, but I want to be in it."
997,I,N,F,P,"Because trying to fall asleep intentionally requires that you pay attention to whether you are asleep yet or not.  Since you can't know whether you're asleep if you actually fall asleep, this means that you can't.  Eventually one of the contradictory actions will win out.  Either you will stop paying attention and fall asleep, or you will be unable to fall asleep because you can't stop thinking about it.

Sleeping unintentionally is far easier because sleep is a comparable process to breathing.  If you don't think about it, it just kinda happens automatically as needed."
998,I,N,F,P,"You're right; this world is not designed for INFP.  So...why are you judging yourself by standards of a world that you admit simply do not work for you?

Somewhere, along this path you're on, you've lost sight of both yourself and the goal you were aiming for.  Was this goal ever yours to begin with, or someone else's?  What is it that YOU want?"
999,I,N,F,P,"Just curious, but what made you choose Mint over Pop\_OS?"
1000,I,N,F,P,"Yes, it is.  Continuing a friendship when views are too divisive to be bridged is doing no favors for either person.  I feel it is a far kinder and loving act to let a friendship go than let it devolve into constant debates with endless explaining and defending, that only serve to leave both feeling like absolute crap."
1001,I,N,F,P,"I wish I could help, but truth is I feel what you're saying and all I can honestly say in return is that you're not alone."
1002,I,N,F,P,"Hmm... dreams are easier to interpret by the dreamer as they nearly always pertain to personal things.  But here's a few things...

Darkness in my experience represents the subconscious, or in general, things we do not consider in the light of day.  That you comment during the dream it is easier to see in darkness suggests whatever it is is something that is not part of your conscious life.

Writing in dreams is rarely clear and even rarer to remember, but when it is tends to be meant as a message from the subconscious.  How you feel about the message, both in the dream and while awake, is just as important as the content.

Entities in dreams tend to be representatives of archetypes or aspects.  You don't specify whether the voice sounds masculine or feminine.  Regardless, this one sounds like a wise guardian type.  It sees clearly where you cannot and seems to be trying to protect and guide you in your lack of clear sight.

All in all, this dream sounds strangely like a more direct than usual discourse between the conscious and subconscious mind in that strange area between waking and sleep.  The waking mind represented by the dream you needs the light so it can meet the darkness, but needs the light to be dim or it cannot see the darkness.  The darkness is the domain of the subconscious, which I am sorely tempted to say is represented by that other entity you're talking with.

From here, I'm not as clear as the nature of the conversation seems to be between the lines, as if you both know what's really being communicated, but without actually saying it.  And I think that's the point.  There's a part of you that knows that you aren't yet ready to shine a light on the issue, but you also know that it needs doing.  So having another entity that sees far more clearly and cares for your well being tell you without quite telling you that it's not yet time is a comfort.  Thus the repeated dreams.  You keep revisiting, trying to see if it is time yet.

At least...that's my thoughts on it.  Right or wrong, I hope it is helpful to you in some way."
1003,I,N,F,P,Except what do you do when this is your default state of existence?  May as well be my identity at this point.
1004,I,N,F,P,"I thought this was a ""p"" thing?  I can't always speak for everyone or be absolutely certain."
1005,I,N,F,P,"The stereotype is they whine about being underappreciated.  They are consistent and dependable and try not to go against the grain, so their efforts are taken for granted, ignored, or outright appropriated."
1006,I,N,F,P,"Intel i5-2320 processor, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU.  I learned my lesson years ago about RAM and went for broke.

Sad to hear about the lack of cross compatible multiplayer though.  I was expecting problems with drivers and performance drops, but that never came up.  No ways around that at all other than dual booting?"
1007,I,N,F,P,"Nope, my PC is my PC.  If I wanted a dedicated gaming machine, I'd have a console.  But since I do use my PC for gaming and optimizations make or break performance, I was concerned I'd pick a distro poorly optimized for what I wanted and be screwed before I even began.

But it sounds like I have nothing to worry about and can just pick whatever distro I like and install what I need, which is a huge relief."
1008,I,N,F,P,"I haven't a clue myself, but that's what I've been reading.  Specifically that it has better support for Nvidia and comes with programs enabling gaming for Linux preinstalled.  Not sure how hard those are to setup otherwise or if there's other optimizations involved, thus the question.  The similarity is also intentional, since Ubuntu is both stable and flexible, with lots of support and reasonably easy to learn and use, something Pop and Mint both appear to have in common, but without the unnecessary bulk.

And the link is much appreciated, thanks."
1009,I,N,F,P,"Is that one better optimized for gaming?  Are any distros more or less optimized for gaming than others.  Or are the gaming distros just those that come with drivers and programs I could find and setup myself?

I'm not against setting up Mint myself, but if there's a significant difference in performance or compatibility, particularly because my GPU happens to be Nvidia, then that's where my issue would be."
1010,I,N,F,P,This is gorgeous.
1011,I,N,F,P,"I have not had your experiences and I cannot give advice on your situation, but I can share very specific advice about the INFP condition of getting stuck between two choices.  Do both.  And yes, this sounds impossible.  For your situation, it might very well be.  But here's the thing.  It is part of the INFP condition to want to make the very best choice we can.  But it is also part of our condition to make both the right choice and the one that makes us happiest.  AND we need to know how we feel about these choices and their outcomes so we can have the knowledge needed to make the best choice to begin with.  Do you see the dilemma?

The only way out is to split the difference and attempt to do both.  You may not actually end up doing both.  But, the important part is to stop standing in your own way, believe that your dreams are possible, and then put that creative mind of yours to work to figure out how to make it so.  You WILL come to a decision on what you really want and see the path forward to obtain it."
1012,I,N,F,P,I had to zoom in on this image to even tell it wasn't an actual dish sponge.  I don't know whether to love or hate you for that.
1013,I,N,F,P,"Just curious, but you said recently.  Do you think it has anything at all to do with Covid-19 or related stresses?  I mean this could be a way you're trying to cope because something's really bothering you and you're reaching for a known source of comfort and security.

Otherwise, you might wanna look into hormone levels.  If those are off kilter for any reason, it can do all kinds of weird things to your disposition.

And if none of that sounds right...maybe it's simply that you don't show yourself enough tlc.  Cause if you don't feel loved or deserving of love, then no amount of outside love is ever going to be adequate.

But yeah...point is that while I don't think this is necessarily normal, I think it may be a normal response to a need that isn't being met in some way, whether mental or physical."
1014,I,N,F,P,"I can definitely relate.  If I wanted to share it, I already would have.  And I usually have a reason for not sharing it to begin with.  But sometimes...it's worth it.  I mean if someone asks, and I'm in a mood, I'll ask them ""Are you really sure you want to know?"" and if they say yes, I'll then unload more or less exactly what I was thinking.  I'm not intentionally rude and I don't tell truly private things, but otherwise I am as direct and blunt as I can be, expressing exactly how I feel about it too.  I can get all kinds of hilarious reactions, but mostly it's fallen into two categories:  ""Sorry I asked.""  or ""Hah!""  Either case, the question's clearly been answered so I either get left alone, or I get help or understanding.  Win-win as far as I'm concerned."
1015,I,N,F,P,"Well if you're gonna hold a gun to my head, then ya ain't getting jack."
1016,I,N,F,P,"Now this is just so much bs...  And I know it is bs because I used to be the girl thinking that way.  You can't expect the universe to magically provide the perfect person for you.  So yes, the right one is gonna have to try.  And so will she.  The difference is whether both people think the other is worth it.  And clearly she doesn't think he is worth it.

And to be clear, I'm not saying that anyone should have to be someone they aren't comfortable being to make a relationship work, or for any reason really.  But it is pure folly to assume that right ones are born and not made, or that effort isn't required in either case."
1017,I,N,F,P,You can't get a boy pregnant.
1018,I,N,F,P,"Ne and Si are what help carry those qualities, and both types share low Fe.  We're really not all that different."
1019,I,N,F,P,Her skill is plenty good enough.  From that example alone she'd get offers.
1020,I,N,F,P,Because there is a belief that groups targeted by racism cannot themselves be racist.
1021,I,N,F,P,Am I the only INFP who doesn't immediately think of romance when someone is kind to me?
1022,I,N,F,P,"Completely fair.  If your creation hadn't interested me and the inspiration hadn't been as obvious as day, I wouldn't have wanted to try and analyze it by more realistic standards.  Mostly so I could better envision it's range of movement and possible habits.

And...I think you may have missed what I was trying to say too.  By more realistic standards, the full wing shouldn't exist.  And thinking about it, rather than try and explain that with my very limited terminology, it might have been easier to say that it makes about as much logical sense as connecting another full arm at the wrist/foot, as a complete wing is an entire limb unto itself.  But as this is a fantasy creature and you've clarified it is intentional design on your part, such logic need not necessarily apply."
1023,I,N,F,P,Plenty of people like INFP.  We just tend to have problems liking ourselves and even more issues letting that self show.  So it's not a case of not being liked.  It's a case letting others get to know us.
1024,I,N,F,P,"Yes.  I had considered that.  But I had thought that finger bone was fused in order to better support the wing?  And I was trying to keep my reply reasonably short, but yeah, I know about the chicken wing and considered it too.

What I was trying to point out is not that it is weird that there is a wing there, but that the structure of the wing itself is strange for its position.  That in all known flying vertebrates, the first half of the wing is supported by the entire arm, and the second outer half is supported by either the entire hand separated, the hand fused, or a single finger whose bones I think should be fused?  So having a wing that looks like it could fold in the middle attached at the foot just doesn't make sense.

Edit:  And just realized it sounds like I completely disregarded your point.  I'm not.  It makes perfect sense for there to be working fingers.  The wing itself as the last digit that can fold as a complete wing instead being only the second half of the wing is what has me stumped.  I can't figure out how that would realistically evolve, let alone work."
1025,I,N,F,P,"I can relate with all of it.  Try not to force my opinions until some asinine jerks completely ruin something near and dear to me.  Afterward...the gloves come off.  Fair's fair, yes?"
1026,I,N,F,P,"It definitely shows in your design, and I'm definitely a fan.  But...I'm not sure it works?  The dragon/bat wing design MH is so fond of works because those wings are built from individual fingers, so it makes sense that something that had evolved wings could retain or retroactively evolve working digits.  But for bird wings?  And the entire wing instead of the portion that should exist after the wrist?

I guess I'm not seeing what you were going for with that?"
1027,I,N,F,P,"Are you sure these are homemade?  If so, someone missed their calling."
1028,I,N,F,P,No one deserves this level of stress for something stupid/silly they did in innocence.
1029,I,N,F,P,"Terms get mixed up and misused a lot.  But the basics of it is this:  If you recharge by being social, you're extroverted.  If you recharge by being alone, you're introverted.  Nothing else matters."
1030,I,N,F,P,"If that's a sunset, wonder what the sunrise looks like."
1031,I,N,F,P,It is not gay to appreciate sexual traits of your own gender.
1032,I,N,F,P,"I don't think it is fair to say that Bubbles is entirely herself.  All the girls are hiding something.  It's just that Buttercup's hangup is the most obvious.  Bubbles isn't as oblivious and carefree as she pretends to be.  Like her name, she very much prefers living in a bubble to accepting the ugly parts of reality.  And when she can't ignore it any more and is forced to face them, it brings out the ugliness in her.  Things like repressed frustration and rage and impotence.  She feels like she is the most incapable one out of her sisters, neither smart enough nor tough enough to face her troubles or make a lasting difference.

So yeah.  Bubbles may be unafraid of being childish and silly, but she's hardily being herself entirely when she's got so much bottled up negativity inside.  At least Buttercup is quite open with where you stand with her, and won't just let people insult her or walk all over her without a fight."
1033,I,N,F,P,You don't understand.  The ENFP is the scary one. For they will hug and squeeze and love you...forever and ever.
1034,I,N,F,P,"What's not to understand?  Buttercup is uncomfortable with her girliness, as she is neither into being cute and innocent like Bubbles, nor beautiful and intelligent like Blossom.  What she doesn't understand is that it is entirely possible to be tough and sassy, and still be feminine.  So she acts out, trying to prove that she's not your typical weak girly-girl."
1035,I,N,F,P,"I am simultaneously amused and insulted, so that's perfect.  Thanks\~"
1036,I,N,F,P,"In general it is understood that you do not accept gifts that you are not in a situation to pay back, or would otherwise put you in a situation where you owe something.  And while this flies in the face of what a gift is, the truth is that it is rare to get something truly for free.  You've always got to pay something in return, even if that something is your pride.

However, if you have ascertained the situation and the gift is offered in good faith with no expectation in return, or from their perspective has already been paid, then it is ultimately your decision.  Just make sure that you aren't being seen as a charity case or that you are inadvertently reducing your interactions with others as something to be paid for."
1037,I,N,F,P,"Where's my stereotype?  I feel cheated.  I'm 6w5, jerks! T-T"
1038,I,N,F,P,"Worldbuilding would be boring to me too if I was focused on making systems of things I'm not interested in.  I get myself interested in the world by focusing on the background of my characters, the experiences that made them who they are.  Every thing that makes them tick, that breathes life in them, likewise is connected to another thing in history that breathes more life into the world they occupy.  If you let it, the world will pretty much build itself."
1039,I,N,F,P,I'd say the rarest type here are the Se doms.  Everyone else filters through at some point.

like literally in our society being skinny is so sought after the amount of ppl w eating disorders is insane. nobody is choosing to be overweight, nobody wants to move around in a scooter

him: I body shame people

me: nice 

him: People need to be healthy

me: so? you can be fat and healthy and not everyone can become healthy that easily

him: Fat people are detrimental to society. Look at lizzo

me: i rlly hope ur joking bc that was a disgusting thing to say 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈

him: I just don’t get the Appeal of being overweight

me: there isn’t any appeal in being overweight what do you not understand about that lol. some ppl are built bigger. you can exercise and eat healthily and still be fat, ur just body shaming and being gross.
there is a huge difference between wanting everyone to be obese and not hating on ppl based off of their weight. saying that you would treat someone with less respect simply bc of their weight is GROSS. 

him: I would want them to improve themselves. I just feel gross when after I’ve eaten a lot and feel kind of fat when I look at myself. So I can’t fathom what it must feel like to be overweight

me: well that’s what you think about yourself, like yeah it must rlly suck, but also if they’re doing the best they can they don’t need to be body shamed for it. like you can be beautiful and fat they aren’t mutually exclusive

him: Uhhh
I can’t say I’ve ever seen a beautiful fat person

me: well that’s too bad for you

him: And it’s not like I would laugh at fat people at the gym

me: kay so u would be a decent human being??  like isn’t that just common sense?

him: I’m proud of people who want to improve themselves

me: but sometimes you can’t improve yourself to get to a point that’s satisfactory at least to your standards. and like bruh the prospect of gaining weight and becoming “fat” is TERRIFYING to me
i literally cry over it a shit ton but i would NEVER EVER project my eating disorder and bad body image problems onto how i view other ppl. like that’s their body and like some ppl are just built bigger
and some ppl can’t afford the right foods or time to go to the gym

me: the expectation that everyone should be skinny and perfect is stupid and honestly super ignorant. you act as if everyone has time off and can afford healthy food, and keep proper diet and nutrition 
like what abt the families working to support their kids and have to work 3 part time jobs with no breaks in between and have an extremely limited budget to spend on food so that they don’t in the process sacrifice things like their house, bills, tuition, etc.
no one wants to be disabled and body shamed but if you genuinely do not posses enough empathy in your body to not discriminate against them simply bc just looking at them up and down you see that they’re overweight is rlly fucking sad
in the end if u choose to continue hating on fat ppl and body shaming them and saying this shit, that’s fine idc. do what you want, and it’s not like you owe me anything bc i’m not the one ur insulting here. just next time keep ur nasty ass opinion to yourself"

1043,E,N,F,P,hehe hi!!
1044,E,N,F,P,i- WHY DID I SEE THIS AS SOON AS I STARTED A NEW PROJECT UM PLS
1045,E,N,F,P,our personalities are one big contradiction so i mean yeah lol. i mean we aren’t constantly getting mad or being manipulative but if we’re pushed far enough over the edge we can really explode.
1046,E,N,F,P,all cops are bastards :)
1047,E,N,F,P,awee!! all the entps i’ve met have made me cry at one point or another so i cant really relate
1048,E,N,F,P,the most attacked i’ve ever felt in my entire life what the hell
1049,E,N,F,P,"ESTJ’s are mean to literally everyone, so are ENTJ’s they terrify me. But this is so cute, i’ll always be here for any of my INTPs, y’all are so cute 🥺"
1050,E,N,F,P,"Tobio, sorry I should’ve been more clear"
1051,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP i feel attacked i’m leaving
1052,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP i feel quite attacked
1053,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP 8w7 we can be dangerous like that :/
1054,E,N,F,P,"me, an ENFP, trying to tell a story without interrupting myself and going on about how we should only travel by duck boats:"
1055,E,N,F,P,THANK YOU I FEEL V APPRECIATED I HOPE U HAVE AN AMAZING DAY AND WEEK AND YEAR
1056,E,N,F,P,what does it mean by tangible memories? that you live in the past or something?
1057,E,N,F,P,or an ENFP i think wait acc nvm we do be kinda introverted doe
1058,E,N,F,P,wait so what the hell? is this an ENFP thing or sumn? bc i was just talking abt how lucky i was for narrowly avoiding getting caught sleeping through class lol
1059,E,N,F,P,HSHEUSHJSNDKXOXO
1060,E,N,F,P,yeah pretty much
1061,E,N,F,P,oh- so i see how it is smh
1062,E,N,F,P,"yes, so true!! i did gymnastics when i was younger and LOVED it. i’m definitely still passionate abt volleyball :)"
1063,E,N,F,P,okay but like at kageyama being his socially awkward dorky self 🥺
1064,E,N,F,P,AND UR USERNAME UGH ICONIC
1065,E,N,F,P,"ikr bro, bc like i feel like only the rest of us ENFPs rlly understand how much of a walking contradiction we really are. like our personality makes no sense but like it was relieving to have someone be able to understand me yk"
1066,E,N,F,P,YES YES YES
1067,E,N,F,P,omg bro talking to other ENFPs is like having a conversation with yourself about yourself. that’s so weird it’s the exact same way for me
1068,E,N,F,P,there was this discord server and all of us hit it off instantly and then i asked them what personality type they were and it turned out we were all ENFPs haha
1069,E,N,F,P,wow didn’t need for you to come at me like that 🥴
1070,E,N,F,P,FR. like grr it’s so frustrating and ofc we can only “flirt” with the ppl we’re just trynna be friendly with and then just roast the ppl we acc wanna be with
1071,E,N,F,P,YES LITERALLY!! but then i also am super mysterious like i over share without actually over sharing any super personal information yk? it’s kind of all just surface level stuff but i’m actually hella secretive
1072,E,N,F,P,yep same. i can make friends with anyone but it also means that most of the friends i make i don’t rlly develop strong bonds with :(
1073,E,N,F,P,"yep i can totally relate, i’m struggling w the same issue so i don’t know how to give any good advice abt how to fix the issue sorry"
1074,E,N,F,P,never went into debt and am very careful with my money (MOST of the time) but the first few? yeah those rlly hit hard
1075,E,N,F,P,the only thing i want bfl
1076,E,N,F,P,"hey i’m also a jewish enfp!! anyways, ack that’s so awkward i’m so sorry. plus it’s even worse that we’re people pleasers so we can’t directly say that we were just being friendly."
1077,E,N,F,P,ty :)
1078,E,N,F,P,bahahahah i mean yeah i guess you could say that
1079,E,N,F,P,"it does tysm!! but ugh i wish it was easier to just be like “listen im not flirting with you, i’m just being myself. pls don’t get the wrong idea” any time i meet someone."
1080,E,N,F,P,"that’s fair, i mean it’s not exactly like i want them to be accurate bc i’d rather not let them know how to constantly make me feel attacked"
1081,E,N,F,P,I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEONE ABT HOW I THOUGHT KAORI WAS AN ENFP!! YESSS IM WINNING RN
1082,E,N,F,P,"HI OTHER ENFP HERE IK IM
LATE IM 16 U USE THE CAT EMOJI I LOVE YOU PLS BE MY FRIEND"
1083,E,N,F,P,so we’re psychotic... introverts??
1084,E,N,F,P,yes ❤️
1085,E,N,F,P,i was actually about to bring this up because i don’t really see us as being typed badly. like i mean yeah it’s frustrating for ppl to knit pick at our faults or kind of mislabel us but i don’t think we’re completely typed badly or mislabeled.
1086,E,N,F,P,you already know too much...
1087,E,N,F,P,i mean sometimes they are but these are all like super extreme versions so i don’t rlly feel called out since this is only me at my very worst (which isn’t often) so 🤷🏻‍♀️
1088,E,N,F,P,ah ty!! and yes we have terrible time mangement skills (i would know bc i’m an ENFP getting tutored about bettering my time management) & this is def something we need to work on. but anyways from an ENFP i apologize we suck when it comes to that
1089,E,N,F,P,"that’s definitely an ENFP thing, because i’m friends with multiple ENFPS and we’ll literally run ourselves into the ground with these kinds of conversations. everyone around me tells me i do this kind of stuff too, it’s a bad thing & i can’t really explain why i do it, even though i wish i could"

1163,I,N,T,P,"Not to ruin the meme, but if you did minimal cognitive function research, you’d know INTJs are probably the most emotional IXTXs. They have an internal feeling function as their tertiary. 

Least emotional is likely ISTP or ENTJ. Then INTP and ESTJ. *Then* INTJ and ISTJ. 

IXTP and EXTJs have inferior feeling functions for a reason."
1164,I,N,T,P,I never understood why some people think 13 year olds can’t determine that for themselves. I’ve been sexually actively since 9. I think I’d know by then.
1165,I,N,T,P,And the “women” responding are either 50 year old men or look like this https://mobile.twitter.com/melissablake/status/1170481393673166849/photo/1

1167,I,N,T,P,I was diagnosed and checked Reddit. Nothing interesting
1168,I,N,T,P,"Logically, the types for that correlate with schizoid the most would be:

•ISTP
•INTP

This is due to inferior Fe. The function in the inferior position makes the user struggle at social interaction, relationships, emotional expression, properly accommodating for others, empathy, love, and connection on a familial level. Sounds pretty schizoid to me, especially considering IXTPs are thinking function dominant. 

A lot of people would presumptively say “INTJ”, because of all the stereotypes surrounding the type like “INTJ=cold emotionless mastermind 400+IQ unlovable etc” but those are all quite untrue. INTJs are probably only the 5th least emotional of the 16 types due to them having tertiary Fi. Due to the Fi, they are actually decently emotionally driven and due to their auxiliary Te, they’re also quite sociable/commanding. 

So, INTJ simply correlates less to schizoid traits than ISTP and INTP.

BTW, developer to a budding developer, 
Its fantastic what you have achieved over this year. The more dedicated you are towards the craft, the more you will achieve. 

Some tips:
Focussing on Maths can help you, but the right type of math, like abstract and logical one ( logic and statistics) can give a good push to you for computational programming, like Deep learning, Image processing. 


Github is great to document your code work. 
Keep pushing your work there, and some day you may not even have to show your CV at job interview, let your Github profile do the talking. 

And lastly, try to prioritise which field in Programming you want to push your focus in, like Frontend, Backend, Dev-Ops, Networks, Big Data etc.. 

At beginning try everything, but dont be ""Jack of all trades, Master of none. """

1404,I,N,F,P,"I always feel like I‘m just nice cuz of my morals, like that I just don‘t want to make anyone sad or angry. But then I feel like I could just leave everything and everyone behind in a second without missing anyone, and then I feel like a really bad person, like why am I nice to people if I don‘t even plan on staying in their life, but then again, why do I wanna leave??? Seriously, nothing has ever confused me more than my own self oof"

1407,I,N,F,P,"I mean yeah but at the same time, I’d be annoyed because of 2 simple reasons:


1. I hate getting advice I didn’t ask for, for a some stupid reason I can’t even explain. Probably cuz I won’t follow it anyway lol

do men have unrealistic body standards? yes, but they don’t have a standard for every part of their body. they have being tall, and being skinny or muscular. vs women need to have the perfect nose, hair, eyebrows, body, no body hair and A LOT more.

do both have it bad? yes. are both dumb?yes. but do men have it worse? absolutely not."

1490,I,N,F,P,"Finally, some fucking common sense in this sub"
1491,I,N,F,P,"This isn’t a conspiracy. If you want a conspiracy having to do with deaths as a result of lack of medical care, look at America’s private health insurance industry."
1492,I,N,F,P,"Lmao why is that dangerous? If you use Twitter to get your news, then you’re the only dangerous one here. There’s still the rest of the whole internet to get news from."
1493,I,N,F,P,"Shiiiit, if I was Hillary Clinton I’d have my dick sucked in the oval orifice, too."
1494,I,N,F,P,"Ah, okay, so the last ten years are the only ones that matter. Not the previous 23, where Trump had said he and Epstein have similar taste in beautiful women, many of which were “on the younger side.” Okay."
1495,I,N,F,P,"Probably was about to be, then decided to say it’s Biden’s and “turn it over” to the feds"
1496,I,N,F,P,"40% of all elligible American voters, apparently."
1497,I,N,F,P,"Lol Trump was never a Democrat. He said he was whatever could get him the most money, which is also why he says he’s rich."
1498,I,N,F,P,"Lmao, sure. That’s why this story has been posted in r/conspiracy"
1499,I,N,F,P,It’s almost like you’ve never even read the definition of propaganda.
1500,I,N,F,P,Ask that to the q anon Trumpists in this sub. This shit is just ridiculous. Trump has been known to have sexual interest in underage girls for decades. Why does only the son of his political rival matter-even if this laughable “proof” is true? It’s not Biden’s son who’ll be president.
1501,I,N,F,P,"Uhh, what? I’ve experienced plenty of both, thanks cyclothymia, and I can tell you without a doubt that a low does not feel the same as a high, regardless of how flat or bumpy the ride is. And what does being a celebrity have to do with anything?"
1502,I,N,F,P,"Hey, don talk about my mama like that, son"
1503,I,N,F,P,A low flat line definitely does not feel the same as a high flat line.
1504,I,N,F,P,"Ah, much more readable. Nice."
1505,I,N,F,P,That’s not what I suggested.
1506,I,N,F,P,"Well, the shape is close, but the venations are totally off it seems"
1507,I,N,F,P,"To be fair, STIs are incredibly common."
1508,I,N,F,P,Waiting longer than a year to move in with someone is pointless? Uhhh...
1509,I,N,F,P,"America has always been gullible. Just like every other uneducated, highly religious country in the world."

1511,I,N,F,P,Plant tax
1512,I,N,F,P,"Ask for more pictures, because the mere fact tht this has been unidentified for so long on this sub makes me suspicious"
1513,I,N,F,P,Plant tax.
1514,I,N,F,P,"You’re joking, right?"
1515,I,N,F,P,"Damn, thanks. Couldn’t remember what it was for sure lol"
1516,I,N,F,P,Don’t just blow massive bubbles. All you need is a steady stream all about the same size. If they are too big/fast then they’ll splash water everywhere and you’ll know you’re using too much force.
1517,I,N,F,P,Very cool. I would never have thought these were all the same species.

1526,I,N,F,P,Top notch fewdback here. Looks like OP isn’t the only one who sucks at writing
1527,I,N,F,P,Anger is not “another emotion of pain”.
1528,I,N,F,P,Good bot
1529,I,N,F,P,"Does this mean I’m the leader? I can dig that, I guess"
1530,I,N,F,P,"Lmao how about you get a level of moral intelligence beyond Law=Good. It was the law in Nazi Germany to discriminate against Jews, but, hey, maybe that was a good thing to you."
1531,I,N,F,P,"Mm, that’s too bad, but I’m glad kratom has helped up til now. r/quittingkratom can probably help you out more than people in this sub."
1532,I,N,F,P,"You see, the thing is, a healthy mind wouldn’t be obsessing over _anything_ let alone random internet strangers on social media"

1535,I,N,F,P,Lmao k.
1536,I,N,F,P,"Using only CBD is a great option for anxiety. Lots of ways to use it, and it has plenty of other medicinal benefits as well."
1537,I,N,F,P,"If I smoke CBD, it seems to take away virtually all the effects of THC, not just the anxiety. It’s like I’ve come back down to baseline. May as well have not smoked at all. Kratom does a better job of letting me enjoy all the positives of THC (and kratom) without the negatives."
1538,I,N,F,P,"Always start slowly. My hits are so small right now that I can barely see the smoke. I only take 2 at a time until the last toke when my tolerance is a bit higher, then I take 3 tiny hits. And for the last toke I take about 1 gram more of kratom, just to make sure the anxiolytic effects are strong enough to combat the extra hit of cannabis."
1539,I,N,F,P,"It’s important to go slowly, for sure. It’s why I’ve still yet to take even a single average-sized hit of cannabis. You can always take more if you don’t feel how you would like to, but once you take too much, it can take up to a few hours to get back to baseline. My hits are so small, you almost can’t even see the smoke on exhale. It’s much easier to dose properly with small hits."

Another thing, when I was chatting with Sage, she seemed to allude to my d*ck, which I don't have because I'm a girl. That's another thing.

Edit: i see why you may have found my comment trivial. I just mean astrology as a concept (not being a science in itself) seems unlikely to be based on an undiscovered science because astrology wasnt created based on evidence or scientifically valid methods and there's plenty variation between practices. I just think it's highly unlikely, apart from the technical flaw.
Edit2: sorry i thought u and the other profile were the same"

1691,I,N,T,P,"I kinda agree with you... if the accident was let's say him playing a video game, or he was playing with a cat I don't think people would care. I can understand that it's a work environment so it's unprofessional and he probably should receive some punishment but he shouldn't be shamed for the rest of his life."
1692,I,N,T,P,"Yup, even if I wasn't anonymous I'm willing to disclose. I think the whole taboo around discussing money allows companies to underpay or landlords to overcharge."
1693,I,N,T,P,I wouldn't say douchey but elitist or hipster maybe the better word. It's not that cool to be not mainstream.
1694,I,N,T,P,I don't think it's ok... You should definitely communicate with your so before doing so. If you're hiding it from your so it's probably cheating.
1695,I,N,T,P,Yeah I agree that a gender neutral language makes things less complicated... Like why does a chair or a computer needs a gender? (I'm taking about Spanish specifically)
1696,I,N,T,P,"It's because of Latinos/as wanted a gender neutral pronoun so they made it latinx. 

It's a copy of it but like you said filipino is gender neutral in the Philippines so it doesn't make sense. But I guess you can also argue the word filipino is of Spanish origin (from Islas de filipinas) so it's not far fetched to make it gender neutral..."
1697,I,N,T,P,"Mostly firsthand accounts from people who have left the camps.

1706,I,N,T,P,"This Ang dude is ignorant. 

>Funny enough, Ang traces his conservative awakening to Howard Dean, the early frontrunner of the 2004 Democratic presidential race. In 2003, a few months after graduating from college, an uncle from New York was visiting and asked Ang to meet him at a Los Angeles airport hotel. What Ang didn’t realize was that his uncle had reeled him into attending Dean’s speech for 80-20, an Asian-American political action committee. He was immediately turned off by what he felt was racial pandering.

Not only you're voting against your own people, but you're voting for a party that really doesn't give a shit about minorities well being just because you ""don't want to be pandered"". That's what politicians do... Pander, and sometimes you gotta suck up pride and be OK with pandering. 

>In the summer of 2004, Ang went on a road trip from Texas to Georgia to visit friends. “I went through the supposedly most racist states, and instead, I actually got the most hospitality from [people in] red states. Met the nicest people. … Liberals would say these things about the racist South, racist Republicans, racist conservatives. And all I saw was the exact opposite of that. People welcoming me in their homes, being interested in a very real way, and not in some tokenized fashion.”

It's called Southern Hospitality but just because they were nice to you doesn't mean they're right or aren't racist. The south has been historically racist and some parts of it definitely make me uncomfortable... just because they serve you ice tea and BBQ don't make them not racist..."
1707,I,N,T,P,"♫ Don't say it, cause I know I'm cute ♫"
1708,I,N,T,P,"No. It's stupid to think that the birth month affects your personality.  That would mean that every person I share the same birth month or birthday with I would be very similar and I know that's not the case. 

It's just generalized enough so that it applies to 90% of people."
1709,I,N,T,P,"Like the other person said there are toxic people of all types. 

I do feel like it's hard to get along with TJs as an INTP though. There's some kinda disconnect."
1710,I,N,T,P,"NTA - As much as roommate A is trying to be altruistic, it's really not great for her to bring someone in without talking to you guys."
1711,I,N,T,P,"YTA - It's one thing to expect others to call you by your correct pronouns etc... It's another thing to try to correct other people's language when they're not referring to you or aren't necessarily harming anybody. 

I feel like sometimes you just have to accept colloquialism as colloquialisms... It's NBD when people call their friends as boyfriends or girlfriends imo. If you want to clarify you should say ""so"" or ""partner"" which is better anyways because it's gender neutral."
1712,I,N,T,P,Why is rule #2 implemented? It's not like you're going to out this celebrity with this story.
1713,I,N,T,P,I think overall it might've been a blessing in disguise that we lost today. We were #1 in r/nfl power rankings and that put us in a spotlight even though we were a flawed team. Today showed that we're flawed and there are places we can improve upon.
1714,I,N,T,P,Sometimes we have bad days. I think if we didn't lose momentum in the 2nd quarter we had a chance.

For me I am a Bernie fan so I don't really agree with a lot of what Biden stands for. However, I am not going to vote green party and vote for Biden because I want my vote to be useful."
1737,I,N,T,P,"If you want to vote for 3rd party, you should vote to abolish First Past the Post with something like Ranked Choice Voting or Star voting. Otherwise, your 3rd party vote is wasted and only helps the person you least likely wanted to vote for to win."

1796,E,N,F,P,Thank you
1797,E,N,F,P,You're welcome
1798,E,N,F,P,I'm sorry to say this and you're probably really attached to your parrot but that robot is spying on you and there are cameras in the eyes  that see everything you do as long as the bird is there. He may seem like just a cute little bird but there's more to him so be careful
1799,E,N,F,P,The cake is brainwashing you
1800,E,N,F,P,That's the unicorns they put in there so we keep believing that they aren't real but I know the truth I used to have a unicorn that I lived with and when the government found out they took him from me and I cried so much. Then I found out that they make cake out of unicorns and that's when I stopped eating cake for my birthday. They tell you cake is made by sugar milk flour or whatever bullshit they tell you but they're lying. And they make it taste really good and they made it a thing to eat it at birthdays so you will be brainwashed into thinking that birds are real the moon is real and that unicorns aren't real. WAKE UP SHEEPLE
1801,E,N,F,P,Yes but don't eat them the government put chemicals in there to make us believe birds are real

1840,E,N,F,P,"She was a teenager. I'm 100% fine with teenagers taking advantage of pedophiles attempting to solicit them for sex. She didnt rape them, she stole their money."
1841,E,N,F,P,So you felt this way even when you were younger? Around what age if you recall? Like 13-14? 16-17? 19?
1842,E,N,F,P,"Would you mind if I asked when you started feeling this way? 

Majority of incels from what I've gathered are just people who struggle with social interactions, particularly those of people they're interested in. But as somebody who has also faced threats of violence and harassment irl from people who prescribe themselves as MGTOW and incel, I definitely understand why some people take the word negatively. But just as its wrong to base an entire race/gender/religion off of the worst it has, it's wrong to also do it to the incel community. People just tend to be hyperactive to negative people and while it's good to call out bad behavior, its not good to attack the group as a whole. 


I'm sorry that it has been used against you in this light."
1843,E,N,F,P,"Well unfortunately my friend in his 30s hasnt responded to me yet, but I'll come back and let you know when they've responded. I havent spoken to him in a little under a year, and I no longer live in my home state so we've drifted apart a good bit. The other two I'm not friends with on social media, but I sent them texts. So we'll wait and see!"
1844,E,N,F,P,"I believe it, I dont understand your situation but I have definitely been in the position of needing mental help and not being able to afford/find it. Its discouraging to say the least. 

They also have crisis intervention hotlines that can help you find therapists near you and although I dont know what country you're from, if it's in the US the YMCA/YWCA sometimes have unisex classes and sessions for people to help them understand themselves and work through issues."
1845,E,N,F,P,"I mean being aware of the issue is the first step in everything. Troubleshoot 101! So you haven't talked to anybody about your social anxiety and sought help to try and manage it? I'm sorry you're struggling with that, it's a tough one for sure. 

I'm not yet 25 so unfortunately I dont have a lot of friends in the 30s age group yet, but I have met a man that didnt have his first partner until he was 33-34, and now he has a child and a long term partner(I'm unsure if they've married yet). His issue was he was socially awkward and never was very good at talking to women. Since he was not comfortable with it he just started avoiding it because he didnt wanna be embarrassed by it. So he threw himself into work and basically just lived to work. 

But he came back to the states and started trying to get back into dating... it didn't go well. We actually met because he tried flirting with me, not knowing I was married. He surprisingly didn't run away though and instead we sat and chatted(I did most of the talking, he was very uncomfortable but didnt seem to wanna leave either). I talked to him a bit, got to know him, we decided to become facebook friends, and stayed in contact for a few years. I asked him if he would wanna come on here but he hasnt gotten back to me yet."
1846,E,N,F,P,"It's a common problem unfortunately. I'm happy you're aware of it! 

It's all about the practice bud, learning to carry on conversations is a skillset all on it's own! Just like any other skill set, it requires practice through trial and error. 

I've always understood incel as a person, mainly men, who have not successfully found a partner(sexual or otherwise) despite trying. I'm not 100% on the definition of it and different people within the community seem to have different interpretations/standards for being one. Another commenter on this thread stated they dont believe anyone under 24-25 can be an incel because they are still within the ""normal"" age range of finding a partner. Everyone I've met that identified themselves to me as incel fit the description I described but the majority (4) were under the age of 25. The other 3 were between 25-34. Does that answer your question?"
1847,E,N,F,P,"I mean it's me saying the ones I've met that identified themselves to me as incel/ex incel that have discussed it with me have told me this is what helped them so I'm sharing it in the hope it can help you too, so yes it would be me encouraging you."
1848,E,N,F,P,"Wow that actually sounds a lot like my friend except his was largely spent overseas and working. Was just so focused on doing other things that he kinda lost track of time and he wasnt very good at talking to women anyways so he just threw himself into other things to avoid it. Ended up being very off beat and quiet around other people which made it hard to have conversations with him. 


I'll message them and see if they'd be willing to come on. I'm not even sure if they have reddit?"
1849,E,N,F,P,"I mean this is only temporary though, thankfully. It will end one day and we can somewhat go back to being around friends and family often. 

I know what you mean my dude. I went to 3 different therapists in a year before I found a good one for me. 

I hope you find one soon, and I hope your path to self discovery leads you to success and happiness within yourself"
1850,E,N,F,P,"Alright so working with that definition I have found 3 people over that age that identified as incel at the time of meeting and then changed it sometime after I met them(29, 25) or were already ex incels and we discussed the topic(27 year old) all three said therapy helped them see a lot of their issues and then finding something that brought them joy enough that they could talk about it and share their enjoyment.  Which then lead to them developing better conversation skills/habits."
1851,E,N,F,P,I DIED AT THIS
1852,E,N,F,P,"I mean why is it trying to become more interesting for womens attention? I think that may be apart of the issue, dont you? You view doing things in an attempt to gain attention rather than finding things you do like that sparks excitement in you. 

It's not about being attractive to women, it's also about finding something that genuinely makes you happy, figuring out how to articulate and share that with others, and then people will be attracted to that. 

Having passion and enjoying things is what attracts people, no matter how mundane you may think the things you're passionate about are. 

Like here's a good first question: 

What's something that really makes you excited?"
1853,E,N,F,P,"I mean the guys I've met that identified themselves as ex incel never even had girlfriends... the guy that lost it at 33-34 hadn't had a girlfriend until he turned that age. They arent together anymore but from what he told me she gave him insight into a lot of his deeper intimate issues and he took that to his therapist. Now I think he has a kid and idk if they're married but they've been together a couple years. 

The guys in their 20+s all never had girlfriends either that they ever told me. I cant think of any guys I've met that had identified as either incel/exincel that had a girlfriend while in their incel period. Went on a date or two maybe but never had an official relationship/sex. Though I've read about ones on the internet that say they've had sex/had a girlfriend but cant find/get any now and that's why they consider themselves incels. 

I'm not 100% on what exactly qualifies as an incel/the accepted terms of it."
1854,E,N,F,P,"I mean I suppose? It would be hard to talk to the person though as they wouldnt really have anything to talk about. Hobbies is a very broad spectrum, and playing video games can even be a hobby. I can have a lot of conversations about Skyrim lore and what not. But if you just play video games and you cant really talk about it or have any type of actual discussions about it then it falls flat. Just like you can also like crafts but if you cant really talk about it/share your excitement and joy about it then it's not gonna seem very interesting and the conversation again would fall flat. 


A lot of people prefer to be with people they can have real conversations with and not just idle ""hey how are you"" and if that's the most you're offering as far as conversation goes, its gonna be repetitive and boring. At a friend level that's fine cuz it's just checking in, but if you're trying to be more than friends that's not gonna cut it for most people I know, myself included."
1855,E,N,F,P,"But that's also because I myself am younger in age so I dont really hangout with people much older/younger than I am. So I think that may be why I've only met a few in the 22-34 age range, because that's my age range."
1856,E,N,F,P,"I mean what do you define as college age? The one guy didn't lose his virginity until 33-34 I think it was, I know it was over 30. Two of them were like 25-27 and the others were <25. I haven't personally met any in their 40s but I've read a couple posts of guys who are that age and still struggling."
1857,E,N,F,P,"All of the former incels I've met have been guys who were socially awkward and unambitious/don't have hobbies they enjoy outside of playing video games and watching TV. They found their way out through therapy, finding hobbies and things they enjoy that they can talk about and have good conversations about, and going out making friends/ meeting people. 

I dont know if the guys in this thread would agree with that but that's just been what I've found with the guys I've met. 

I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope some of what I've said was helpful. If you wanna talk feel free to DM me. I've also struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression."
1858,E,N,F,P,I'm also in this Facebook group lmao
1859,E,N,F,P,"No the fuck hes not lmao the first woman reported him immediately. He was off duty when he did it. Other women were contacted and showed them where it happened and when cross examined with his cruisers GPS for that time, they matched. That dude had so much evidence against him lmao nope"
1860,E,N,F,P,"Humans will pack bond with literally anything and its both adorable and absolutely fucking bonkers at the same time. Like we pack bond with animals that would absolutely turn on us given the chance and yet we're like, ""nah man. I gotta protect this thing with my life, it's not as smart as me and doesnt know any better"". Meanwhile we pack bonded with other animals so much that we've turned them into house pets. Wild."
1861,E,N,F,P,"I always feel bad during these discussions because I had a miscarriage and I dont really care about it. I was only a few weeks and it was mainly just cramping and bloody. I went to the doctors about it and that's how I found out. I just thought it was a bad period with some blood clots. But I still didnt talk about it with people because I am a slut and enjoy sex fully and knew they'd try and spin it into something nasty when in reality, idk why it happened but I'm not upset about it I hadn't drank or partied or anything during that time. I started opening up about it 3 years ago after I had my son. So even if the miscarriage didnt make me feel bad, the knowledge that there are people out there who will try and attack me because of a miscarriage I had no control over was still there and I hated that."
1862,E,N,F,P,"Great job not feeding the troll! Take a look at the profile, you'll find you're right."
1863,E,N,F,P,"Cointelpro #2. As soon as I heard the FBI was gonna start ""cracking down"" on race based hate groups. I knew they'd use that as an excuse to target black groups under the guise of calling them ""hate groups"", just like they did before. Last time the FBI did this they committed crimes ranging from slander/libel to outright assassination while ignoring groups like the KKK who were actively commiting lynchings and murdering African Americans. 

Fuck J. Edgar Hoover and this broke ass law enforcement system. Buncha racist psychopaths."
1864,E,N,F,P,You're a strong woman and you dont need a partner who leaves you alone and let's you down when you need him most. You'll find better!
1865,E,N,F,P,"Same, I was raised by very slut shamey family (hypocrites but still) so I was very against sex work until freshman year in high school when my friend talked to me about it and I understood. Now I support sex work and making it a legal and safe job market for men and women who offer their services. Like we all have misconceptions and ideas we were taught that we can learn and grow from and be better. It just takes effort."
1866,E,N,F,P,Nondisclosure doesn't cover illegal.
1867,E,N,F,P,All of us retail workers already use it lmao
1868,E,N,F,P,"Nope, happened in PA. State wanted to make a game land, so they kicked a bunch of families off the land with the exception that they let their graveyard stay put and they'd maintain it. ""We'll give you market value of the land. That's it"". State could have easily done the same thing in this scenario."
1869,E,N,F,P,"I get treated this way as well. I often get told I act like a ditz/bimbo because I'm bubbly and happy most of the time. But then when I do get serious and talk about meaningful stuff I often get ""wow I didnt think you were that smart of a person"" or some variant of that and it's always super insulting.

Edit: sorry I cant be of much help :( I have the same problem and typically just get serious/angry whenever people start disrespecting me as well :/"
1870,E,N,F,P,I've been attacked with this multiple times in my life. Its depressing. My husband and I are both pan/bi and he doesnt get nearly the fetishizing I get but he gets way more negative reactions than I do. He tends to not tell people hes into dudes at all because of how hes been treated.

1883,E,N,F,P,She went back in for her other child... she didnt know neighbors had already gotten them out...
1884,E,N,F,P,I'm fucking crying over this because she went back in to try and find her other child and died before she could... she must have died thinking she couldnt save her other child... as a mom this fucking wrecks me...

1886,E,N,F,P,"We said this during 2016. Hes gonna attack minority rights. They said ""give him a chance, you're all just acting hysterical"" now that hes doing exactly what we said he would do, they're defending him and acting like this isnt what we were afraid of."
1887,E,N,F,P,"Oh, also what happened to Nikola Tesla and what exactly he had invented. I want to know all that he had created in his lifetime. From what he destroyed to what the government stole. I also want to know for certain if he killed himself... or if he was murdered."

She has something she enjoys, and it isn’t harming anybody (in fact, it’s making 30k people happy), so why do you feel the need to change her or force her to let go of a hobby she not only genuinely enjoys and wishes to share with you, but also gets attention for? 30k followers on twitter is not easy! It almost seems like you feel her 30+k followers invalidates your alternate sense of humor and that’s kinda lame buddy."

1908,I,N,T,P,"I always thought pan meant gender doesn't have a play in attraction (i.e. gender blindness), whereas bi people do consider gender when choosing an s/o or sexual partner.

But then omnisexuals exist, who are like pansexuals (i.e. attraction to all genders) but are not gender-blind.

And polysexuals also exist, who are attracted to multiple genders, but not all, and not usually gender-blind - who are generally considered different from bi people because they can be attracted to, say, cis/trans men, and masculine enbies - but not to women. (Though some then prefer to then identify as androsexual - attraction to anyone on the more masculine side of the gender spectrum - or gynesexual - same but for femininity). 

So to me it seems like a lot of bi people, based on technical terminology, are actually omni or pan but just prefer to identify as bisexual (for personal comfort or simplicity for others), while other bi people are primarily attracted to the binary genders.

But whatever it is just identify as whatever makes you most comfortable. Sexuality is complicated!"

That is clearly meant to represent the Nazi party, and defending its presence on that jacket is incredibly ignorant and insensitive, particularly considering what that symbol means, and what the people who used that symbol have done.

Not accepting the presence of Nazi symbols used in representations of one’s personality is not erasing history in any way.

This spoke to me on a spiritual level.

I had no idea what actual sexual attraction felt like and had no desire to have sex with anyone for 20+ years of life until I started dating my current boyfriend after months of close friendship. Feeling it for the first time just by looking at him was surreal and so overwhelming. I’m still struggling to understand it. I now find myself catching my eyes drifting to *certain places* when I see him walk around and thinking about him instead of doing my coursework. It’s such a new and wonderful yet distracting and frightening sensation.

1937,I,N,T,P,"I have “Asperger Syndrome”, which I hear isn’t commonly diagnosed in some countries anymore, but I was diagnosed back in the early 2000’s at age 6 and still believe that it is a valid and unique condition that should continue to be diagnosed for the benefit of those like me with it. 

It’s a much more socialisation-based disorder than intellectual. Personally, like the older sister you mentioned, I got through school just fine, often pass as neurotypical (albeit a bit awkward) at first meeting, and I’m currently in university doing... pretty ok. I do have a bit of an odd way of speaking - I speak so fast I stutter, my tone can change like a rollercoaster, and I tend to be very, almost irritatingly verbose language-wise.

Since I was diagnosed so early, I had early intervention by a therapist, and my parents did their research and put me through theatre and dance to alleviate some communication and physical symptoms, and gradually exposed me to many different environments and situations to build up sensory tolerance. As I got older, the symptoms became less obvious but it was a pretty arduous process. That doesn’t mean I’m cured - not at all. I just got pretty good at hiding it."

I'm not sure of IQ tests get to messure correctly what you understand it is. Anyway, when it comes to theory and concepts (including arguing and understanding) I think intuitive types might show more intelligence, just becuase of the fact that they're more open to abstract ideas. Meanwhile sensor types are probably more intelligent when it comes to accomplishing things and manipulating physical reallity."
1963,E,N,T,P,"I consider myself more of an extrovert since I like spending time with other people, I'm usually very friendly and I dislike being on my own for too long. But I'm not the most extroverted person I know. Just more outgoing than my introvrted friends."
1964,E,N,T,P,"""Sometimes you don't know when to stop""

I'm an ENTP female"
1965,E,N,T,P,I've got both ravenclaw and slytherin
1966,E,N,T,P,"I'm an ENTP and I think I might have had ADHD. I had big paying-attention problems when I was a kid, to the point of getting in trouble and I still get distracted very easily. But I've never been diagnosed ADHD so I'm not sure, it might just be my imaginative nature."
1967,E,N,T,P,"I'm an ENTP and I was also extroverted when I was little and then when I was between 6-12 years I started zonig out a lot, specially during school, to the point my parents thought I was deaf because I wouldn't even answer to my name sometimes. After that I started beiing very conscious about myslef and my surroundings and became really shy but I was always extroverted and spent all the time with my friends. Now (24 years old) I'm pretty balanced, I'm rarely shy and I'm usually able to pay attention. I enjoy sozializing with people I like but I'm pretty selective, and I also like to spend some time on my own."
1968,E,N,T,P,HAHAHAHAHAHA
1969,E,N,T,P,"I'm an ENTP and my biggest flaw is probabbly not being sure about anyting. Like almost everythig can be right/acceptable for me in a certain way, I can understand anything but people does expect restricted things from me so I just have to cut myself from doing some things or lie, it also applies to future plans. I don't think it's necessarily such a bad thing it just doesn't match with current society."
1970,E,N,T,P,"Yes, at least when it comes to phisical reality. Im ENTP and  my memory is shit"
1971,E,N,T,P,">Mmn... somewhat true I guess, I see now why I might not be Fe. I've got zero empathy for people trying to reason with me from an emotional standpoint (read: big scary loud energy), esp. if it's overdone. It's more about the behaviour that I disrespect (= can't focus on the meaning because their emotions are too much to process it) than the point they're making. Esp. if they decide to force a reaction without letting me cool off & process it calmly, or pursue me with the issue for hours / behave passive-aggressive after I already explained myself. I would not get angry & acknowledge how they feel if they took me aside and calmly stated how it makes them feel without projecting their emotions at me = trying to make their problems my problem.

this is a good point. I'm an ENTP and if I'm pretty flexible as long as the other person is flexible with me too, I don't take it as a personal thing. I live and let live, and try to make thigs easier for everyone. Ii take care of people I know is good. But if I see someone is trying to take advantage of me I just jump into their game and even turn the table but I do not get personally offended. We all know what we're doing."
1972,E,N,T,P,no
1973,E,N,T,P,hey i'm drunk too
1974,E,N,T,P,"I'm ENTP and my dreams are usually pretty absurd. When stressed I very often dream with circumstances where I have to acomplish something but many obstacles keep apearing on my way. I also dream a lot with really weird scenarios where people I know have some problems and I have to help them find a solution. I also have dreams with a clear subconscious meaning sometimes (like when I was stucked with something I would dream with trying to find a page from a book that I could neve find or trying to close a door that would always open back). I also dream with flying a lot. Sometimes I dream with being something else, like a duck, for example. 

I usually always remember my dreams, they usually change a lot. What is always constant is I always remember the spaces to the detail: the architecture of a building, how the places look. They are places that do not exist on reality but appear frequently repeated in my dreams."
1975,E,N,T,P,"It's good to be crytical and to be honest about what you think but you also have to know hor to say things if you don't want to be taken as a ruthless monster. Before saying something empathize with the other person, if you are an INTP I'm sure you will be able to understand why others do what they do. Connect with them, flatten the land first and make a constructive  criticism. That's the only way you'll get people to actuallyget better instead of jusst hating/disliking you. Good luck!"
1976,E,N,T,P,"IQ only works when applied to western standard education. There are parameters that aren't quantified into the IQ test and circumstances that do not count in. Low IQ means under-development on the areas that the current western education works on such as logic, language and math which, even is common, does not necessarily mean being less smart. When it comes to MBTI some people thinks it's somehow related to IQ, it might have some statistic relation but I don't think it's determinant."
1977,E,N,T,P,>Back haha this pretty traumaizing for entps we got all the turbulent stuff
1978,E,N,T,P,whytf is covid 19 entp?
1979,E,N,T,P,"I'm afemale ENTP and I've always been empathetic and even at my lowest empathy moments(when I was  teenager) wascringed by people who tryes to be the ""emotionless hard guy"". You're not even brave until you know what empathy means. Growing up this feling just kept increasing."
1980,E,N,T,P,"Same shit, honestly I think when both feel it you already know even if you don't word it"
1981,E,N,T,P,"Not true, I keep secrets and take them to thegrave with me."
1982,E,N,T,P,"Hahaha I understand, I don't even believe in MBTI anymore and I'm still here. It's just so much fun. I think it's related to how simplifying people into those labels makes it easier to interpret what and why each person does."
1983,E,N,T,P,YES
1984,E,N,T,P,"Me and my bf spent months saying things like ""I like you a lot"" when actually meaning ""I love you"" until he said that he loved me once when we were drunk and I told him back and then we started officially dating. He's an INFJ."
1985,E,N,T,P,"That's why I usually don't tell I'm an atheist, every time I've done it and there is a religious person around they try to convert me or ask me things trying to lead me to admit I believe on something. I respect religious people and don't try to make them stop believing, why can't they stop evangelizing? Idk why they get so annoyed by someone not believing, just let be!"
1986,E,N,T,P,"Yes I do that too but I don't think it's that bad, it's always good-intentioned and people can just decide if they're taking it or not.

If I give undesired advice and they tell me to shut up I take no offense I understand ;)"
1987,E,N,T,P,Your friend might have difficulty or rejection towards thinking and talking about feelings because for us that's apretty grey area and can make us unconfortable. It might help to explain him your problems by telling them that you worry about something and what the problems in your life are and  ask them if thy can think of some solutions. They will probably jump into that conversation easier and try to find solutions for you and confort you giving a more optimistic and fresh view.
1988,E,N,T,P,"I like INTPs a lot. They smart, interesting, know a lot of stuff and they don't talk too much but when they do it's usually to say something interesting or funny. They're pretty laid back too which is nice. I had a crush on a INTP for a while.

My boyfriend is an INFJ though. I love INFJs too, he is really smart, knows so many things, I can have interesting conversations and he's usually very sweet and supportive. 

My ex was an ESTP, it was a lot of fun but it didn't work too well."
1989,E,N,T,P,"I'm an atheist but my parents were too so I don't have that bound to religion. It feels natural to me, I don't think it's a bad thing, I respect religious people and go to church if I have to (like weddings or funerals). If you don't feel like you believe you're probably an atheist too, if you don't want to tell your family about it it's ok, that's your choice."
1990,E,N,F,P,hehehe
1991,E,N,F,P,Great! Love this.
1992,E,N,F,P,beautiful!!!
1993,E,N,F,P,Im in this picture and I don’t like it
1994,E,N,F,P,YOU GOT THIS! I’m an ENFP studying to be a psychiatrist :)
1995,E,N,F,P,"I second this, I also vent by writing poetry haha"
1996,E,N,F,P,"Hey, I'm a Capricorn and an ENFP! Although I don't really know much about astrology and never really got into it :)"
1997,E,N,F,P,Also I'm pretty gay and he's just a friend but I think his personality is objectively attractive!
1998,E,N,F,P,"Hey I think they're awesome! Not sure if the one I have in mind is ESFP or ESFJ, but he's pretty nice and does a great job trying to keep everyone in the room happy and positive :D"
1999,E,N,F,P,Thank you :D
2000,E,N,F,P,haha so accurate
2001,E,N,F,P,Thank you so much for this!! Yeah I know us ENFPs can seem very spontaneous and do things on our whims—that’s honestly so true and a lot of the time my sister is always telling me that she thinks some of my actions are rather out of the blue and not logically based! I guess I will have to be pretty strategic and try to reassure her that I’ve covered all my bases and have actually thought this one through. Thanks again!!
2002,E,N,F,P,"Hey thanks for your answer! That definitely does help a lot. It’s awesome that you also have the same MBTI sibling pair! so because you have the same sibling pair I was wondering how the ISFJs would think about their ENFP sibling following “nonconventional paths” for example, I’m queer and I don’t really plan on marrying or having children which goes against tradition/stability and I know ISFJs are usually very keen on adhering to tradition (at least that’s what I read during my research!) However I know my sister wouldn’t force me to do anything I don’t want to do, but I’m worried that this decision may cause her/my family stress. Usually ENFPs can be very unconventional people so I was wondering how ISFJs process this and what I can do to make it easier for them?"
2003,E,N,F,P,bruh this hit too hard
2004,E,N,F,P,thanks for this!!! they are really helpful
2005,E,N,F,P,this is amazing!!! great job
2006,E,N,F,P,do you have any lines/self-talk mantras that you use daily? id really appreciate them if you do!
2007,E,N,F,P,thank you so much for this awesome post with so many great suggestions!!! im excited to try them out
2008,E,N,F,P,thanks so much :))
2009,E,N,F,P,Thanks so much for this comment! Yeah I’m a senior in college and I also cope with it by making people laugh w my self-deprecating jokes but I guess what you say really does have an effect on your self-image even if it’s just a joke!
2010,E,N,F,P,good to know im not alone 🥺 we got this :))

2056,I,N,F,P,True
2057,I,N,F,P,That's real art!
2058,I,N,F,P,"Herrlich, da musste ich erstmal drüber nachdenken!"
2059,I,N,F,P,Thank u for the invitation~ I might just do that!
2060,I,N,F,P,"Tell me about it... I don't know why does it matter if you decide to sit alone or not, enjoying our own company is not supposed to be strange."
2061,I,N,F,P,"Thank you for that advice! I feel like it may have been due to my body language, i tend to slouch sometimes. Nevertheless, i envied your sense of ease with yourself. I wish to unwind in the same way!"
2062,I,N,F,P,"I really wish i can do the same. I used to take early morning walks before work and now that i've entered uni, i find myself missing simpler days. 

in regards of the social anxiety, i havent talked with a doctor yet. Maybe soon if it gets too much."
2063,I,N,F,P,"I can actually change between courses, but only business majors. I did try getting involved with many extracurriculars but most of them are not active yet (due to covid) and some requires for us to go from a place to another. I don't have my driving license yet (working on that one). Moreover, i'm also struggling financially during these times so i gotta juggle between studying and doing my online business. Basically at this point, i'm just trying to stay afloat."
2064,I,N,F,P,"To be honest, getting into the uni is my second choice. Before i got into uni, i've finished my HND and i'm more interested in finding a stable job. But since the covid, there's not much job offers and most of us are stuck doing internships or continue to degree. I wanted to get a job, but my family wouldn't allow me if it wasn't a stable job. In regards to my course, i used to be interested in Marketing when i'm doing my HND but now i find myself more invested in Psychology. I used to take them during A Levels, i didnt get good marks tho. But i wouldn't mind putting the extra efforts in restarting over again during degree. I wanted to change my course but there's no psychology course in my country's universities."
2065,I,N,F,P,"You're not the only one, dude. I have difficulties in leaving chat groups from previous schools unless i changed my numbers."
2066,I,N,F,P,Yes. And it's driving me crazy because i am a tidy person in general.
2067,I,N,F,P,Goddamnit.
2068,I,N,F,P,Why you gotta call me out like this
2069,I,N,F,P,"Usually, i wait until they paused or stop before saying my piece. It can be annoying when they didn't give us a chance to talk but it also gives me more perspective and allow me to think more on my answers."
2070,I,N,F,P,"Exactly! Why can't people understand that some of us dislike attention solely on us, even during conversations? Good for some of us who aren't fazed by intense stares during conversations but spare some consideration for those who don't."
2071,I,N,F,P,"Thank you! Personally, i prefer occasional eye contacts in conversation so that i can regroup my thoughts and engage well into the topic. It's true that you guys might think that people might not be paying attention to you, or avoiding you when you refuse to make eye contact. But for some people, it made them a better conversationalist as it made them feel more comfortable to speak up more. I have few introverted friends who can relate to this and some who's more comfortable in maintaining eye contact."
2072,I,N,F,P,"Cook heavenly meals for you. (Looking at you, mom)"
2073,I,N,F,P,"Contrary to popular beliefs, no eye contact when you're talking/listening to someone actually makes the conversation more progressive and in depth. So, please don't demand eye contact lest you want me to spout nonsense and starts rambling."
2074,I,N,F,P,"Why can't people understand, treat others how you want them to treat you. Respect, tolerance and understanding goes both ways."
2075,I,N,F,P,It's a great form of escapism. Though it tires me out more when i woke up because now i have to truly face it.
2076,I,N,F,P,I wish we can spend the night at the beach once. Sounds lovely!
2077,I,N,F,P,"You should def try it! Alone or with a friend, the beach is a wonderful place to wind down for a moment!"
2078,I,N,F,P,Something about this song really hits different esp when you're passing your teens and into young adulthood.
2079,I,N,F,P,"dang, i feel you. I used to like staying at home until quarantine happened."
2080,I,N,F,P,"I don't think being 'too sensitive' is a weakness. I have the same issue as well, feeling too much and personally, i used to think that it's a curse. Until i met my english teacher who told me that to feel deeply is a blessing and it makes you empathize better. Though about your issue with your partner, maybe you can try talking it out? It usually helps but if she invalidates you, then you should go on your merry way, sir"
2081,I,N,F,P,Being a singer and actress at the same time. It's my dream to portray deep emotions via singing and acting.
2082,I,N,F,P,Thank you for your thoughts
2083,I,N,F,P,"I feel like it's not worth it, that essay. I could have spend more time with my cat in her final moments. I wouldn't care about that essay in two months time but i would still remember my cat by then. And thank you for your condolences"
2084,I,N,F,P,Thank you .. Your condolences is enough
2085,I,N,F,P,"Disregarding a cry of help. Unfortunately this happened to me, back when i'm still battling with depression. I've been having auditory hallucinations before and i thought it went away after a year with no episodes. It appeared again, suddenly out of nowhere and i felt scared that i might fall into an episode again . 3 of my friends watched me breakdown that time; one made a conscious effort to try easing me out of it while another one tried to convince me that everything will be fine. The last one, she's texting on her phone, dismissively waved away the whole incident by saying, ""It's only a phase. It will go away"". 

Two weeks later she asked me if she might have depression because she felt sad. A**hole. I never forgave her for being insensitive."
2086,I,N,F,P,"Happier by Ed Sheeran. Sounds twisted, but i use this song to convince myself that people in my life would be happier without me."

2101,I,N,F,P,"Oh god, reminds me of that Geography exam i took back in high school... alot of the answers i wrote down initially were correct, yet i had second doubts because i finished too early and decide to change them.I could have gotten a good 86 but i got 54 instead....😂😂😂 (I knew this because the teacher is my aunt in law, who actually pointed this out to me the second she finished marking my paper)"

2105,I,N,F,P,oh my god... Exactly!! Sometimes we end up taking up things that we don't even like because apparently people think 'it's better for us'. Then end up regretting it and sometimes effed it up because we just can't get ourselves motivated to finish it...
2106,I,N,F,P,"exactly... It's good that some teachers of mine told us to report to her if there's any groupmates who didn't contribute anything but most of the time, they do this when all of us are present and sometimes we just let them pass so that no unnecessary drama will occur and shit. Some teachers don't even care."

2109,I,N,F,P,"Just for context: Verona is the most racist, ultra-catholic, right-wing homophobic city in Italy. The annual World Congress of Families ( ignorant dumbasses that like to complain about gay people being allowed to exist), that got a lot of attention and was basically an italian far-right parties meeting point, took place in Verona last year.

2134,I,N,F,P,"If the cameras are a PRIORITY, I wouldn't go with OnePlus. Cameras are good but nothing special. If you want a 7 series in 2020 I'd suggest you to get one used/refurbished. I don't know prices in other parts of the world but I got my 7 pro 12/256 refurbished (great conditions) for 480€."
2135,I,N,F,P,I'm now following you. Post more Sasha. Thanks
2136,I,N,F,P,"Hey! My name is Filippo and I'm new to the game. My native fruit is lemon🍋. It would be cool if you added me, here's my code! 1533 7562 210"

2138,I,N,F,P,Wel Corberi looks like he's 2 meters. Look at his walk back to the pit lane after he crashed. He's towering all the marshalls
2139,I,N,F,P,"Hey! Brutally honest: I'm 19, I've started reading during quarantine and know nothing about you. Which book you wrote would you recommend me?"
2140,I,N,F,P,Bruh Corona-chan was at her peak 3 months ago lmao.
2141,I,N,F,P,any update?
2142,I,N,F,P,Now that's glorious
2143,I,N,F,P,No that's Emma Watson
2144,I,N,F,P,Yeah right now I just have to wait for a US friend (???) to come to Europe during a pandemic.
2145,I,N,F,P,"I just wish we could get the snapdragon version in EU. I hate this difference Samsung is making, it's just bullshit, if I could get the snapdragon s10e without paying 150€ import fees, I would already have."
2146,I,N,F,P,"THIS. I'd say it's even a downgrade, really the only SLIGHT pro the SE2 has over the s10e is the processor and the cameras, everything else is just plain worse. Design, display, battery, features, repairability, everything. If OP desperately wants an iPhone he/she should absolutely wait for the 12."
2147,I,N,F,P,Is nobody gonna talk about how fucking sad the pizza in the background looks like?
2148,I,N,F,P,"So, i dropped the anime after a while cause I thought it was shit. Apparently the manga is very different, is it good?"

2152,I,N,F,P,"Come fate a studiare da casa? 

Quando i prof caricano lezioni da due ore spesso e volentieri (siccome posso sostanzialmente guardarle quando mi pare) rimando all'infinito e anche quando riesco a guardarle ci metto il doppio della loro durata effettiva.

Senza parlare della voglia di studiare zero nel momento in cui mi ritrovo da solo in camera mia ( solitamente studio con i miei compagni di corso in biblioteca, cosa che adesso è impossibile visto che siamo tutti sparpagliati in diverse regioni).

Qualsiasi consiglio è ben accetto!"

2155,I,N,F,P,"Fenati did a good job in Moto3, and was doing a great season (for a rookie) in Moto2. That incident is the absolute dumbest shit he could ever have done, if it wasn't for that he probably could have been in MotoGP together with his ex-rivals Mir and Binder. Oh well, he deserves all of this anyway (coming from an ex fan)"

2162,I,N,F,P,Thoughts and prayers bb :’)
2163,I,N,F,P,Yeah I think I’m closer to an ISFP especially because I’m a 4w5. Not all INFPs are conflict avoidant it’s mostly the type 9s.
2164,I,N,F,P,Yeah exactly. We’ll be like that until the period before it’s due and then it’s panic time 🤩
2165,I,N,F,P,Took me out

2167,I,N,F,P,Poor bebé what’s the point of being ESTJ if not mean functional working machine :’/
2168,I,N,F,P,"No you’re right. We’re not peaCe and suNshine, we’re justice, expression, and that can mean many things, but most of the time INFPs are eccentric characters, wildly individualistic."
2169,I,N,F,P,Nah pretty cheap because they criminally underpay third-world-country underaged workers
2170,I,N,F,P,Yeah true. I can control it but I still feel the same tbh.
2171,I,N,F,P,I guess I’m still holding on to my inner child :)

2184,I,N,F,P,ENFPs: Is this an invite to torment this unsuspecting ISTP?
2185,I,N,F,P,All cuz we happen to have a brain as said by tikkle me
2186,I,N,F,P,We are neither optimists or pessimists we’re just in AU #24
2187,I,N,F,P,"Exactly, this is why I’m so interested in psychology. I want to know whey humans are the wya we are and if I can beat the system in a way idk how to explain it"
2188,I,N,F,P,"I’m a Virgo sun aries moon and I’m literally the opposite of all of that. It depends on the person tbh and the other placements. The Virgos u guys met sound horrible, kinda like my liBra friend. It’s crazy that they’re ok with capitalism because Virgo’s whole thing is doing the right thing etc"
2189,I,N,F,P,Also the awkwardness and the desire to be understood and find your “pUrpose”
2190,I,N,F,P,"Okay but YES i was looking for this comment. Callum reminds me of Zuko way too fucking much even tho he’s voiced by Sokka’s VA. It just fits. He’s like a softer Zuko, like a mix of Zuko and Aang if we had to choose."
2191,I,N,F,P,Your lil flag tho felt that
2192,I,N,F,P,I think that’s basically meditation but I’m not sure

2199,I,N,F,P,I’ve tried to explain this to my mother and I’ve done it for probably over half an hour but she still refuses to get it. It’s so frustrating.
2200,I,N,F,P,This is so beautiful I love it
2201,I,N,F,P,*not even pictures of the sky bring me joy*
2202,I,N,F,P,"That’s cute, I wish I liked bugs but they scare me for some reason I do not know why and I can’t control it 🤩I think they’re pretty from afar though (exceptions include ladybugs I once cried over a dead ladybug)"
2203,I,N,F,P,I am curious as to whY because it’s such a weird deal breaker but this made me think of “boys will be bugs” by cavetown. I have the same thing but with cats; if someone hates cats I don’t trust them.
2204,I,N,F,P,T ^ T  I’m so sorry for your loss and yeah I feel you I dropped art after having a mental break in front of my family about how the only thing that I love and actually care about now leaves me with only an immense feeling of dread :’)

* I'm lazy, I don't clean up after myself, even though I live alone and I'd rather live in dirt than put effort into cleaning up. I'm gonna change this. I'm gonna make a habit of cleaning up regularly by writing down a time slot for cleaning and following it strictly.
* I'm bad at following up, I think it's kind of a repetition of the 1st one, but the same idea, I don't complete whatever I begin. 
* I lack boundaries, I'm very aware of this but sometimes I'm not aware of this. I'm gonna bring myself to make boundaries and respect boundaries. 
* I'm bad at conversations, I need to get better. 
* I'm very good at talking negatively to myself to the point I really hate myself. 
* I'm a man-child, should not be surprising.
* I don't have a neat and simple wardrobe which suits my style. Again, what's my style? I don't have one."

2213,I,N,T,P,"Unrelated, but I'm in Germany right now, I dropped out of a uni here before and was at home for a few years unemployed and I told my mom that Germans study till they are 30, and my mom pulled out the culture card too. 

I mean, I'm only the 2nd generation educated in my family on both sides and I think Indian parents need to start respecting boundaries of their children and start treating adults like adults. 

I think the situation is better for Indian men in this aspect."

2216,I,N,T,P,"India has zero interests in innovation. It's currently running on the service economy route. If innovation was the major interest it would have done it already even at small level, but they cope with non-sense concept like ""jugaad"" which actually ruins everything."

2242,I,N,T,P,"Roscoe is of a breed which is bred to look like that and that breed of dogs usually have breathing issues due to the way the facial skeleton is arranged mainly caused by inbreeding. Maybe the vegan diet is getting rid of the excess fat of the dog. But it means nothing. It will shorten the dog's overall life IMO, but it's Lewis Hamilton's dog, so it will get the best vegan dog food, but a lot of fools who follow him will surely kill their own dogs with malnutrition. 

Also breathing = cooling down of body. 

This is not just for dogs, many mouth breathers have breathing issues because they have facial skeleton problem which can be fixed by visiting an orthodontist. 

Also allergies can be fixed with elimination diet. Allergic to something? Don't eat it. Simple."
2243,I,N,T,P,How stupid do you have to be to believe this non-sense?
2244,I,N,T,P,I can relate to this at many levels.

And if people are fighting that their type is best, so be it. Leave it to them. Don't beat yourself up for it if you don't belong to the said ""best"" type. 

People who do meme analysis are trying to find meaning in it. And idk why you are shocked. People are not robots, their types only mean something to some extent and a lot of other factors are also involved which help shape their worldview and their attitude towards life. For example, it is true that INTPs spend most of their time online, but it doesn't mean there are no INTPs who enjoy nature. 

I'm personally using MBTI as a way to improve myself. I wanted to know how and why I do certain things. And it has helped me a lot."
2254,I,N,T,P,"True, I kinda agree, but it is all for fun too. To know yourself is also a beginning to solving your problem. And MBTI is an outlet for that. Of course, you shouldn't use it as a clutch. There are plenty of ways."

2266,I,N,F,P,Dogs are omnivores
2267,I,N,F,P,Yeah but it makes me really insecure. In a way i’m happy to be an individual but at the same time i feel gross
2268,I,N,F,P,Yeah that too. It’s gross and ableist. People are PC till antinatalism is hinted at.

2271,I,N,F,P,Why are you so mad exactly? Can you rationalize it?
2272,I,N,F,P,Maybe look at yourself before being so judgemental and awful to another person. I hope you learn to be more compassionate and accepting before you have kids.
2273,I,N,F,P,Holy shit lol. They really dont understand that some of us are going through “whatever we’re going through” for our entire lives. And will continue to struggle. And have parents that struggled. I’d rather not pass on whatever is making me struggle. I’d rather not be responsible for someone when i know i’m very unindependent sometimes.

2275,I,N,F,P,"I have this fear too and the way you wrote it is absolutely terrifying. Legitimately panicked. Congrats, you actually ruined my sleep, for the next 2-3 weeks probably. And i can’t go outside at night to smoke anymore."

2278,I,N,F,P,"Ok so how do you know she hasn’t already spent the equivalent amount of money on the child? And don’t forget, the person not raising a child likely has more free time to work and do whatever, without having to pay for childcare. It takes two to make a child, so it shouldn’t just be one doing the rearing. Childcare is expensive. Child support is to help the single parent and their child survive comfortably. Have some compassion."
2279,I,N,F,P,"is it ok for straight women to like sports? jeez, of course it is"
2280,I,N,F,P,this is dumb and judgemental. this idea that single parents aren't allowed to buy themselves anything really needs to die. the reason the can't afford cigs might be because she has already spent her entire paycheck on her kid and other necessities.
2281,I,N,F,P,"There is no proof there’s a god but there’s proof that the animals on your plate feel pain and have the ability to suffer. God gave you a brain too, why not use it to see reality instead of hiding away behind religion?"

You can just go to your GP and explain what you’ve said here. Just explain what you’ve been doing, and that your behaviour is worrying you. Don’t be embarassed to ask for help, ever. You deserve it!"

2286,I,N,F,P,Ok time to throw up.. no way that’s comfortable.
2287,I,N,F,P,Yeah it probably was a shit place. This is the kind of attitude you see in fastfood. Any actual restaurant should be fucking ashamed to accidentally serve meat to a vegan/vegetarian/religious person regularly.

2299,I,N,F,P,I just wanted to tell you i’m in a similar boat. Im currently going down a path i don’f want to. I hope we can get out of this.
2300,I,N,F,P,"gross, man"
2301,I,N,F,P,Gross
2302,I,N,F,P,Harmful in what way? Where do you get your eggs and dairy where the animals aren’t cruelly transported and collected?
2303,I,N,F,P,"That doesn’t justify anything though, does it?"
2304,I,N,F,P,How is this all her own fault?
2305,I,N,F,P,Why do you think it’s okay though
2306,I,N,F,P,wow! how do you get a septum piercing like that? is it just stretched or??
2307,I,N,F,P,"I’m so sorry. Please know you’re valid. And find another doctor to get a second opinion because this is so awful and dangerous. The hardest thing for me was no one taking me seriously. Finding a medical professional (my psychotherapist) who did, changed my world and helped me recover."
2308,I,N,F,P,I’d blend the eyeshadow over the browbone a bit more and do the eyeliner a lot thinner on the lids. You don’t have that much lid space (neither do i LOL)
2309,I,N,T,P,Reminds me a bit of Horizon Zero Dawn. It is a very good concept.
2310,I,N,T,P,I doubt that the ribs would look like this since they poop a lot and big and they are not good at taking in nutrients so their digestive system would basically have to look like a balloon so the ribs would be a hindrance.
2311,I,N,T,P,Onely if enough of the bad juices are flowing out.
2312,I,N,T,P,"Oh, I didn't knew that... Then I might have killed some people. It wasn't my fault. They didn't stop yelling at me and now they are sleeping peacefully. I am sorry Paul, I didn't knew this would kill people... Would you like to eat this ones face or can I have it for my collection?"
2313,I,N,T,P,"You can put it back to factory settings if you push a certain button on the brain, it can be reached with an ice pick placed at the inside of the eye and shoved way up to the brain."

2318,I,N,T,P,I doubt that this would go well since forcing women to abort isn't quite a thing western countrys would consider ethical especially when it comes with some health risks.
2319,I,N,T,P,The human brain has a lot of potential to malfunction.
2320,I,N,T,P,No! What if he is a masochist with a fetish for exposing himself and you can rape people with other things than a penis.

2353,I,N,T,P,Morals are a tool for a functional coexistence. Morals and believes might look like the same but are at most similar. When a child sucks at something it is morally the right thing to give them the opportunity to improve or to say that it failed but it isn't that bad to fail the thing may people feel and believe to be right is to say that it did great and with hard work it will be the best some day even if it wasn't true. Yust because you feel something is right doesn't mean it is morally right since morals are objective (like not doing harm to others).

My uncle and I constantly discuss everything under the sun, because we think almost the same way. He just happens to have more life experience in general so he can always offer me a counter point.

As an ENTP, I can’t really enjoy being surrounded by people who constantly victimize themselves (most FPs I have been subjected to (with the exception being ISFPs)) so being around someone who’s both willing and capable of seeing things from countless perspectives gives those people depth and makes me interest. 

A big issue with ENTP debates, though, is not being used to debating an ENTP in general. Being matched in ferociousness and passion while slinging “technically!”s and “actually!”s is both really frustrating and challenging in the fun way"

 They were taught Nazism was the way, their truth muddled. They didn’t know what they were doing was bad, they thought they were serving their country. 

Good and bad are subjective, and to them, Jews were bad. I think Araki’s depiction of them was more accurate than most given to us in general, as he shows they’ll still fight for good if they agree it is good. 

I understand these topics are controversial and that people will feel hurt by statements like this, but that is literally all there is to it, you can’t not accept that because of personal bias."

You make the same mistake again at the bottom of the second paragraph, assuming that ideologies are less than they actually are. Perfect ideas are an example of ideologies if they’re a logical statement, reference the definition for that. 

One could argue that, on a much much larger scale, everything is perfect; the best it could possibly be. Since physics dictates how the universe works, including our every choice, then everything is as it can be, the only possible at it can be. Everything is perfect on a less human-concept scale. (I’m assuming that you share my view on free will here, if I’m wrong, I’m still indirectly correct since this is a true syllogism) 

I think the most important thing to do here is to go back to the drawing board, possibly reinvent the statement you made to fit more validly."
2393,E,N,T,P,"You’re falling into the same trap you’re attempting to avoid, my friend! 

The whole idea that everything is meaningless is something we both agree on, but still something that is very heavily subjective, both in the way of perceiving it and how you act on it. 

To you, the breakage of rules allows you what you believe to be an ultimate freedom (which one could argue is an illusion in of itself (just as everything else is)) so when someone reaches a conclusion like everything’s meaningless, they’re given the choice to act as they wish to reach the conclusion they choose, which is simply nothing more than peace of mind.

Outside of it being peace of mind, one can’t find one exact formula for what people exactly want, that goes against the idea of subjectivity that ENTPs use to doubt everything. 

You speak of a happy life as if happiness isn’t subjective, about regrets as if all humans are simply creatures of logic. Yes, Elon is probably really stressed when he’s constantly looking to change the world in a hurry, but that doesn’t change the fact that he could be happy. Making an assumption about it at any point is confining him to an indirect view that you hold which you believe to be objective.
—————————————————————-
P1: Changing the world will make you depressed.

P2: Being depressed means you’re unhappy.

C: Changing the world will make you unhappy. 

The hidden assumption is that changing the world will make you depressed, the basis of the first premise. 

—————————————————————-

Instead, what you should be arguing for, is that no one should be forced into anything by anyone, not even the rules and norms of society. That is the better argument to make. 
—————————————————————-

P1: There is more evidence against god than evidence for god.

P2: A universe without a god is inherently meaningless. 

P3: A meaningless universe allows for no eternal consequence in the after life.

P4: No punishment on a divine level means morality is subjective. 

P5: Subjective morality gives you the right to decide good and bad from your world view.

P6: Subjective morality can be identical or wholly unique.

P7: Humans choose to act and perceive based on their subjective morality.

C: you’re the only one who can decide your own view and what actions you choose to follow based on your subjective morality, which can be oriented to grant you whatever it is you attempt to grant yourself.

2402,E,N,T,P,"Then you’ve basically shot yourself in the foot, there. You’re not arguing against ideologies being scientifically grounded, but you’re arguing that holding many ideologies will cause cognitive dissonance. 

Premise 1: Ideas are thought.

Premise 2: Reasoning is a type of thought. 

Conclusion: Thus reasoning is based on ideas.

Premise 1: maths is discovered through reasoning.

Premise 2: All mathematics we know has been reasoned. 

Premise 3: all reasoning is based on ideas.

Conclusion: Thus, our understanding of mathematics is based on ideas.



As for being able to dig deep enough into ideologies, you can do the same for most sciences, find contradictions to ideas we thought to be true. For example, the idea that cells crystallized into existence, Miasma theory, and so on. Ideology in the sense of the actual definition is as much a science as every other science as it is a part of the process of science. 

I never claimed that we’d never reach the ‘correct’ answer to what political/philosophical ideology we need to follow, saying there will be a correct answer in of itself is wrong. 

As I’m sure you know, nothing is concrete. Doubt everything. If everything is doubtable, and we’re confined to our limited perception of our surroundings, even our current sciences break down at a certain level of “deep.”


Edit: just need to provide my definition here real quick: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idea"
2403,E,N,T,P,"Even as an ENTP, what was written could be heavily perceived as someone who has an ego in general, but that is also the nature of the ENTP in general. 

The tests would give you the P letter for sure, ADD would guarantee that. That is why you’re the only person who can precisely pin point what your functions actually are. I recommend you start reading about the 8 functions on their own, then try and see the way they interact. Usually, you’ll get the answer you want!"
2404,E,N,T,P,"A system of ideas doesn’t necessarily need a contradiction. One can say any deduction is a series of ideas. One could easily argue that many mathematical sequences could be ideologies. Outside of all of that, any scientific subject is a series of ideas. 

The word ideology has been used radically in correlation with political or philosophical ideas, which both tend to have some issue built into them. I mean, if we had a straight answer, wouldn’t we all be following the same political/philosophical ideology? 

As for cognitive dissonance causing chaos, violence and aggression, I don’t see why that is related here. If a single example of an ideology that is scientific exists, a statement like yours is wrong."
2405,E,N,T,P,"MBTI doesn’t work like that, it has to do with your cognitive functions. The ENTP cognitive stack is Ne Ti Fe Si. Having ADD could possibly give you the illusion of being an Ne dom, but I’m unsure. From what I see, though, you’re probably an INTP with ADD and an ego that’s pretty big- (don’t get me wrong, we all have egos!) 

Thanos is an INTJ, and so is Gandalf. INTJs tend to have a particularly strong superiority complex (not a very unwarranted one-) and do speak similarly to ENTPs in some situations. Are you sure you are either of the two Ps?"
2406,E,N,T,P,"I’d want to see your definition of ideology, since by the true definition given to me by Google, and ideology can simply be a system of ideas.

You could argue systems of ideas aren’t necessarily scientific, true. But I don’t think that applies to literally every single possible ideology. 

Ideology could also be the study of ideas and their origins in nature, which is as much a science as any other science out there (both being basically a mix of deductive and inductive arguing based on our nature.)"

2408,E,N,T,P,"I straight up make stupid statements and analogies when speaking to people I have an inclination to think aren’t the smartest- it gets my point of view there and solidifies it without me having to fully explain something.

2460,I,N,F,J,Thank you! It would be great if someone knew the part your grandma was talking about :(
2461,I,N,F,J,Wow you’re right!! I’m watching that movie tonight lol
2462,I,N,F,J,Whaaat?? Do you perhaps know the part of the bible that says that? This is so interesting!
2463,I,N,F,J,Thank you for finding it interesting! 😊 I’m currently in the process of rewriting it. Once it’s ready I’ll make sure to send you a pm and let you know!! (It might take a while though lol)
2464,I,N,F,J,"I know.. It’s really interesting! I actually once wrote a short story about a guardian angel falling in love with the boy she was protecting haha. But the other angels ended up knowing about it and she fell from heaven, ending up on earth as a simple human with wiped memories. This was just my take on this I guess 😅"
2465,I,N,F,J,"If angels and spirits can empathize with us and our emotions, does this mean they can also fall in love with us or like/dislike us? 🤔"
2466,I,N,F,J,This is definitely NOT a Greek tradition lmao
2467,I,N,F,J,"Plus I forgot to add that I don’t think I could ever had a one night stand because I’d probably catch feelings for the other person very easily and then secretly hope they catch feelings too. If they won’t that will turn into a huge disappointment and sadness because my feelings won’t be reciprocated. 

I had my first kiss this summer and although it was with a good friend of mine who I trusted, I didn’t have true feelings for him. So kissing him ended up feeling like doing any other task, like sharpening a pencil or brushing hair. Kissing him also kind of made me feel like I was sort of “cheating” on my future “soulmate” (and yes I know this is ridiculous because my future partner could have been in a relationship previously as well -plus no one knows if soulmates exist). But yeah this whole experience made me realise I could never do something intimate like kissing if there were no real feelings involved."
2468,I,N,F,J,"I feel the same.. I’m 19F and I started university this year as well.. Everyone seems to enjoy getting drunk and making out with random people :/ Plus meeting new people face to face is much harder with covid restrictions. 

I’ve never been in a relationship before and idk but I just want to feel loved and give love back while being in a serious relationship with someone. I don’t know how long this relationship is going to last, but I really want to try and explore something I’ve never experienced before. Problem is that for me to actually get in a relationship, I’ll probably have to go on a couple of dates/actually get to know someone before knowing they’re suitable for me and I for them. 

Now with Covid I can only meet new people once a week, and we may go out for a drink or to eat for 1-3 hours tops. I don’t know if that’s enough time for the other person I may find interesting to learn enough about me, especially in a group setting where there may be a lot of noise (bars) and other people to talk to. I feel like in order to get to know someone, you actually have to sit down with them and have a talk by yourselves. Plus I hardly if never take the first step, so I’m constantly waiting for someone else who’s interested in me to come ask me on a date. 

I feel desperate for love these past weeks lol and I know I do because I keep looking at couples on the street and can’t help but want what they have. I’ve had these feelings before university as well. 

Maybe I should act in a more extroverted way when I see someone I like (but still I feel there’s not enough time during outings to actually decide if I’m into someone) or maybe I should just try and focus on myself and let whatever’s meant to happen happen. 

Idk but I wish us all good luck with our love lives, health and a good school year. Covid makes finding love harder, but we can still hope."
2469,I,N,F,J,"For real. I still don’t know if I’m an INFJ, INTJ or INFP"
2470,I,N,F,J,"You may feel like you two are spiritually connected and while this may be true, please be careful when dealing with spirits. You never know what you’re communicating with and although it may appear harmless in the beginning, it could potentially be a negative energy that has nothing to do with Kurt himself. Of course, putting up your protective walls, keeping a positive attitude and feeling strong against any negative energy or spirit can help with making sure nothing hurts you spiritually, mentally or physically. All I’m saying is be careful. People with undeveloped gifts are very prone to making mistakes while communicating with spirits."
2471,I,N,F,J,"What if you can give constructive criticism without feeling too bad about the other person, but at the same time you can’t really deal with criticism well? What MBTI type does this sound like??"
2472,I,N,F,J,I’m guessing it has something to do with the 7th or 5th house?? Or maybe it’s something completely different UGH I’M SO CURIOUS NOW
2473,I,N,F,J,How can you see what sign you’re going to marry? :0
2474,I,N,F,J,I’m so glad someone relates!!
2475,I,N,F,J,"I can relate. I had my first kiss this summer with my best friend, and although it was fun and he wasn’t a bad kisser, I literally felt nothing while doing it. It was just like performing any other action, like catching a ball or brushing your hair, except this time my mouth was touching another mouth. 

My sister kept telling me to continue making out with him for the experience, but as a huge romantic, I couldn’t do it. The next day and after making out again for like two minutes, I told him I couldn’t do it because I didn’t feel anything. He knew I wasn’t in love with him and since he knows me very well, he understood I had to be in love to do things like kissing etc. He’s an ENFJ by the way. 

After this experience, the thoughts in my mind went like this: 
Wtf am I doing?? Did I really want this? It’s ok, since he’s one of the people I really love and care about.. But what if I actually had my first kiss in a loving relationship? Wouldn’t that be better? Nah, I can’t wait forever for that to happen...

Unconsciously I felt like cheating on my future soulmate, while I knew any future partner I may have could have made out or had sex with another person as well. 

I think about my ideal partner or soulmate a lot. Not so much about his characteristics or personality traits, but I think of him as a blurry image of a guy that I’m supposed to meet one day.

Yes, I know it’s not realistic and that I’m a huge dreamer. I also know things like this happen in fairytales, but I can’t help it :( Sometimes I wonder if I’m actually an INFP.

I’m sorry this is so huge, it’s just one of the things that are constantly on my mind..."
2476,I,N,F,J,I remember reading an article about how some japanese women used to dive for pearls etc. Maybe it has somethings to do with your vision?
2477,I,N,F,J,RemindME! 1 month “update?”
2478,I,N,F,J,"It may be hard for us Pisceans to accept it, but it’s true. What’s also true is that we only do it out of love (and our need to make you feel comfortable with us) :)"
2479,I,N,F,J,"What personality type would you say is capable of ‘unfolding’ us and finding more things about our deeper self? I often struggle with this since 99% of my current friends do not try to understand me on a deeper level. I may be able to analyze them and help them in many things, but they don’t put in the same work... So far, only an ENFJ cared enough for me to actually sit down and listen to my problems, but he still didn’t ask me to tell him about them. I don’t know if I’m too selfish but I feel like I just want someone to be like “Now we’re going to talk about the things troubling you. What’s on your mind?” 😢"
2480,I,N,F,J,Keep him lol
2481,I,N,F,J,I’m in this photo but I like it

2484,I,N,F,J,"I have saturn in the first house and I’m a taurus rising. I look much younger than my age and it has been this way since the day I was born. Of course, moon trines my ascendant so that may be another reason why this happens. I believe Saturn in the first house doesn’t make you look older, it just makes you look more mature and perhaps wise."
2485,I,N,F,J,Lol now all I have to do is to get my psychology degree
2486,I,N,F,J,Thanks! This really helped me out!
2487,I,N,F,J,"What if you do think the bottom one is true and are about to say the first one, but you also think lying is wrong so you end up saying nothing? Lol is this more INFJ or INTJ? Please help me cause I’ve been struggling to decide ://"
2488,I,N,F,J,"Thank you, this really helped!! I think I’m an INFJ, although it took me a lot of months to finally accept it. I do try not to let emotions affect my decisions, but I’m still empathetic and emotional and I let my intuition guide me most of the time."
2489,I,N,F,J,"Thank you for your answer, I really appreciate it!! :3"
2490,I,N,F,J,"I see.. It’s just that people always say INFJs are always so empathetic that they often get very affected by how people around them are feeling. 

I’m able to understand others emotions but I don’t let myself feel what they feel. I’m often very straightforward and don’t care about others opinions if me a lot, although I dislike criticism. 

I just don’t know if I’m an INFJ or an INTJ... INTJs often sound too cold and while I am cold at times, I can also be very caring and loving to the people I vibe with :/

What do you think?"
2491,I,N,F,J,Idk if it’s that easy. I feel like I’m right between INTJ and INFJ because I’m not always cold but not super empathetic either
2492,I,N,F,J,These look like the two Pentatonix guys lmao
2493,I,N,F,J,You’re a great fucking friend
2494,I,N,F,J,Thanks a lot! I think I’ll need to do some research first though
2495,I,N,F,J,Lmao the spoiler was in the very first sentence. Maybe you should hide it so that only people who actually tap on it can see it.
2496,I,N,F,J,Thanks for the spoiler 😒 ffs

2506,I,N,F,J,"My assertiveness overpowers my turbulence. That’s why the test said I’m an INFJ-A. That doesn’t mean I’m not turbulent at all or that I’m 100% assertive. Also the idk was to show that I’m open to all opinions. I believe that’s an INFJ trait. Anyways, thank you for your input. It made me research about INTJs more 😊"
2507,I,N,F,J,Are these mods available only for pc? :/
2508,I,N,F,J,"I put my plants, any crystals I have and my tarot deck next to my window. Also, because my window is right next to my bed and I have a full view of the night sky, sleeping during the full moon is pretty impossible. Not only because the light keeps me awake but the whole energy makes me tense and doesn’t really let me relax. So I choose to meditate, express how grateful I am for everything I have and just soak in the beautiful moonlight instead 😊. Surprisingly I don’t really feel tired the morning after, but refreshed/rejuvenated and calmer."

2639,E,N,T,J,"I care very much about values. Do the best, do it fair and never harm anyone."
2640,E,N,T,J,Wow 😍
2641,E,N,T,J,Definitely 😂
2642,E,N,T,J,HAHAHA WTF
2643,E,N,T,J,"That’s awesome, more power to you. I wish to start a side business in the near future after I graduate from college!"
2644,E,N,T,J,"Thanks, I’ll keep that advice in mind!"
2645,E,N,T,J,Thank you! You’re the only person who shared their story so I’m glad it’s a successful business :’)
2646,E,N,T,J,Thank you! I was wondering why it was so quiet here
2647,E,N,T,J,Nobody touch that bamboo.
2648,E,N,T,J,Exactly
2649,E,N,T,J,Yep I agree with this.
2650,E,N,T,J,"Yes they struck me as ENTP too.
P.s. if someone could give me a lesson on how to tolerate entps that would be nice"
2651,E,N,T,J,Exactly this
2652,E,N,T,J,Treat fake people like how you’d treat fake anything
2653,E,N,T,J,😂😂😂😂
2654,E,N,T,J,Exactly! Working out and socializing is very integral.
2655,E,N,T,J,Where are the ENTPs
2656,E,N,T,J,HAHHAA
2657,E,N,T,J,This definitely can be possible. Someone needs to come up with the algorithm tho. I don’t code but I don’t imagine it’s impossible!
2658,E,N,T,J,"I just wanted to say, I know what failure feels like. It makes you feel so shitty especially because success means everything to us. It might feel like your entire personality has been ripped away, like you’re hollow. 
But guess what, time will heal. That is a certainty. You will discover yourself, that flame and that drive, in time. Let your mind heal for now. Be a little patient. But don’t stop being yourself. Hope to see you come out of this stronger than ever. You’re the fkn Phoenix my dude"
2659,I,N,F,P,"You have yet to point out anything of substance.

Whatever we write anywhere, we can be sure people exist who disagree with it or could react to it negatively. The fact that this someone like that is present here or not doesn't change anything and doesn't provide any additional information."
2660,I,N,F,P,"I think you hastily paid attention only to certain words you didn't like without considering full context and intent behind words. And thus you're not actually answering to what is written, but to some imaginary comment that doesn't exist. It's not a productive way to engage in conversation if you want to change anyone's mind or convey yours, it's more of a tactic to start bickering or to make someone to shut up.

Also functions are about tendencies and preferences, they don't control your individual actions. Just because I don't ""have"" Se or Fe doesn't mean I'm not using them all the time. And of course there aren't actually 16 kinds of people in the world and if looked strictly scientifically all of Jungian philosophy and MBTI is bullshit. But that doesn't mean it can't be used to help us understand people we wouldn't otherwise understand."
2661,I,N,F,P,"At no point did I claim that Fe users can't care, just that caring in a conscious sense isn't an inherent part of Fe, and that Fe users can easily avoid caring while continuing to use Fe.

I think we will all be better off if we will use reddit to freely exchange our actual perceptions and perspectives without fearing to say the ""wrong"" thing instead of telling each other to read a book. If we think anyone is wrong it's always possible to simply point out precise wrong parts and convey an opposing view, or to ask to clarify parts we didn't get."
2662,I,N,F,P,"I think ""caring"" is a bit too generic to describe it.

More like, Fe users more often don't get the choice whether to empathize or not. Which may pass off as caring, but also is it really? Fi caring is more conscious, Fi users don't get invaded by other person's feelings - they can only get honestly interested in a particular person or humanity in general, and try to get them. Fi user is *required* to care to empathize, Fe user is required to defend themselves to *prevent* empathizing, and that in itself can create pretty consciously uncaring tendencies (giving off labels like toxic and narcissist left and right, door slamming people, in general - habitually finding Ti rationalizations why people around them are defective to prevent Fe from attaching to their emotions)

And Fe doesn't inherently care about the specifics too much, it's more content staying at ""awww you're so sad sweetie"" level, not interested in striving to get as close as possible to the precise condition out of infinite possibilities of what ""sad"" can be."
2663,I,N,F,P,"Nah, your comment was totally fine. For what it's worth I really think you are one, a subgroup of INFJs :)

If you don't mind one personal question as well - did you have some kind of turbulent environment at school or at home? Like, caretakers quarrelling or sharing too much or divorsing or some emotional teachers/classmates somehow forcing you to deal with their problems?"
2664,I,N,F,P,And Karens
2665,I,N,F,P,Are you an INFJ by any chance? :)
2666,I,N,F,P,But you would in fact conserve massive amounts of energy by not existing...
2667,I,N,F,P,"Well, regardless whether you paint or don't paint you'll die and all your actions, memories and skill will dissolve as your brain will dissolve. If you're driven to paint you paint, if you aren't - you don't. Some like fantasizing, some don't. There's nothing making anyone better than anyone else, we just live for a while and then stop living.

Why do particular actions feel better than boasting for you personally? Boasting is also an action. Dreaming is an action. Our entire existence is an action.

If it's because you feel repulsed by action of boasting internally and not some other actions, then isn't it just a random happenstance of your pre-existing condition, and you could've instead been repulsed by those other actions, which would've reversed your position?

So then the overarching principle would be to be yourself. And not because you feel you have to be someone or find something, just because you're already are everything, just like everyone else."
2668,I,N,F,P,"I want to read people's minds and have them read all of my mind and I want to create other planets connected to Earth by bridges and I want to have my soul travel to other universes and retain my brain's memories.

Point is, compared to what they could be, our ""realistic"" wants are just as limited and created by circumstances and external conditions as wants of a cat."
2669,I,N,F,P,I wouldn't mind doing whatever I want while my cat goes to work every day
2670,I,N,F,P,"It's ""better"" for you so you're doing what you think is better which makes you better in your own eyes. It's highly recursive :) while others may look at you and see you regressing in their eyes.

There is no information on our purpose and goals, so there's no way of knowing who's ""better"" in an absolute sense."
2671,I,N,F,P,The sound of a deflating balloon.
2672,I,N,F,P,"Yep, that would be the anti masker position in context of this video"
2673,I,N,F,P,"Because people need to simplify and generalize. If we didn't we couldn't understand cartoons, and that would be a shame :)

I suggest a solution - promoting INFP skypics stereotype instead. It's absolutely nonsensical, ridiculous, and totally neutral. People get their cartoons, we get our dignity and lulz :)"
2674,I,N,F,P,"Pretty sure it's very easy for most people to notice their aux functions, and harder to notice dom function because it just is, it's there, and it doesn't feel like anything in particular, just being yourself."
2675,I,N,F,P,"So that's the opposite of what one would think conscious and unconscious are :)

I think it's pretty common to completely misunderstand your own dom function because that's who you *are*, not what you use. It doesn't have cleanly defined borders and limits, it permeates everything. We don't make effort using our dom function, it's not really a choice.

And aux and tertiary are more like tools we can consciously employ, so for example it's very easy for me to see my Ne cravings and Si sentimentality/hoarding, and separate them from ""me""."
2676,I,N,F,P,"Okay, but I if I won't like it I will look for you, I will find you, and I will use my particular set of skills to express my feelings of disappointment."
2677,I,N,F,P,A two legged stool held up by a two legged table?

2683,I,N,F,P,"Well I think we should be brave enough to reclaim the lips! 👄

And make them the manly man's way of expressing manhood 👄

Pretty please?

How can I be authentic without the lips on my emojis?..."
2688,I,N,F,P,"It's Te. When challenged or when we're stressed we may fall into solving everything directly and bossing people around. Being pissed off, insecure, annoyed, angry can make us dictators complete with inner drives and butthurt of a dictator. It's also what wants to make yourself and others conform to standards - and it's easier to get pissed off at others that they don't conform.

Fi is actually the antidote here :) keep the inner sight on your own actual condition in the moment while having your negative emotions, not on what others should be or you should be or the world should be. Simply sense what's inside without judgement.

ps. Oh, and staying calm internally while your parents are reprimanding you for anything or not validating your emotions in general is super pro level. It's easy to fake - incredibly hard to do properly, without killing off relationship with parents. If you get there in like 10 years that would be incredibly fast."
2689,I,N,F,P,"Just because they don't want to talk about it doesn't mean they don't have depth. They just don't express it in words, or don't feel the need to express it. They live, they feel the reason to exist, hence it works for them as good as the most complex philosophy ever. Expressing it in words or anything else isn't required and is in fact detached from that feeling. Being alive is so incredible as an experience no amount of added talking and conceptualizing will make it substantially more profound..

It's like, many artists hate explaining what their artwork means. It just is, free for everyone to take from it whatever they want. There aren't too many artists willing to endlessly debate what their motivation was or what was the purpose or how exactly is it supposed to be perceived - instead they simply keep creating and talk about unrelated things.

Your life and your personal search for something meaningful in life may require them to provide you something they don't want to (or can't) provide, which of course pisses you off and makes them subpar for your purposes. But it doesn't make them shallow, just not quite suitable for your needs at this point in your lives."
2690,I,N,F,P,"I just thought of a much better way to express what I wanted to say instead of my sort of meandering comments -  she reframed the situation in her head to avoid looking at herself as the victim, which automatically removed bad feelings of being hurt, and thus massively reduced the bad experience.

But if she's not the victim, if it's she who screwed him up in the end and controls his emotions and has the upper hand then this coping mechanism will aslo prevent her from fully delving into feelings of being hurt by him. That is, IF she was hurt by him and cared for him at all. If she never cared then it's all good :)"
2691,I,N,F,P,"I think, there's a huge difference between a silent treatment and a breakup. The line may be blurry in some cases when the breakup happens only in one person's head while the other one is completely oblivious, but in this case she made him know she knows by leaving breakfast, and he got back to his ex from her which may mean he dumped her already anyway. *Maybe* even precisely because of passive aggressive behavior like this one."
2692,I,N,F,P,"Nah, I get it. I was immediately taken aback by the ""ugly girl"" comment, then thought for second why would anyone write that :) Our past thoughts and experiences become so familiar and inherent to our thinking if we relive them enough that we don't realize how they might actually look from the outside, it's just a train of thought that is automatically expressed the same way over and over again.

I think, people were downvoting you because you didn't hint at the separation between your past self and current self, and didn't provide your real views on this.  For example, to make a more blatant imaginary illustration, compare: 

1- ""I used to kick some weak faggy looser because he was pathetic and weak, and laughed at him with my mates lol"" and

2 - ""I used to bully a kid whom I viewed as pathetic because I wanted to fit in with my friends and my feelings towards people were created by my understanding of standards, not my real opinions"".

These two comments might reference identical feelings from two perspectives, but it would take some effort to empathize with the first one instead of downvoting and moving on."

2704,I,N,F,P,"Try not conceptualizing emotions and not thinking about emotions, not converting them into mental images or actions or whatever, just doing nothing other than feeling them, continuously for some period of time, and you'll eventually sort it out (and gain a new skill in the process)"

2707,I,N,F,P,"I'm curious, do you expeess your feelings about her looks in the way you remember wanting to express your past feelings back then, or as you remember her looks and describe your present feelings?"
2708,I,N,F,P,"Expressing emotions is what helps us cope, it's a part of the process. Letting go, feeling angry, expressing righteous fury, seeing his pathetic face blabbering weak excuses. There's no benefit for ourselves in smothering our expression of emotion. By living through all stages of grief we can process grief for the lost relationship and move on for real. Without any need to change towns or delete social media, as if she's some criminal.

We can't process anything if we simply run away and allow imagined sweet vengence replace emotional processing. If we don't allow ourselves to feel fully bad and live through it, and instead interrupt our own emotions and try to immediately cushion them with fantasies of how miserable the other person must be right now, it's possible to get stuck on this stage for ages. And elevating ourselves by thinking about how cool we door slammed someone also merely prolongs the same hangups in perpetuity. By trying to make ourselves invulnerable to emotional pain we merely prolong it ..."
2709,E,N,T,P,Why the fuck are you being downvoted for being curious?
2710,E,N,T,P,This sub can be super toxic honestly. Some of these posts will literally people wanting to be silly and the OPs get pissy at the posts. I've had people try to call me out for victim blaming while I repeatedly say a victim is never at fault and btw this is 1 of 2 subs so far that I've had people pick at 1 part of my comment and start arguing as if we were on Twitter and I've never used Twitter.
2711,E,N,T,P,Understandable
2712,E,N,T,P,Yk I thought someone would mention about how much of an asshole god was during the old testament but the fact that theres only an explanation of the nature of cats kinda makes me sad.
2713,E,N,T,P,That's completely understandable I too hate type blaming or when people claim only x types do x thing.
2714,E,N,T,P,"In the long run lying can damage your integrity, and make you less trustworthy. If I was friends with someone and I learned that they lied to me about a bunch of stuff. Even though they thought it was insignificant I'd drop them on the principal that they dont see me as worthy of their trust.

It isnt a ""because"" thing its literally a shitty character thing. Lying implies you dont trust someone. You could make every argument in the book but at the end of the day it's clear you dont care about them or you dont trust them. But even if you stop to consider it most people, when hearing your line of thought would go ""so you knew it was wrong and did it anyways? Wow you're just and asshole."""
2715,E,N,T,P,I ALREADY HAVE THE PLANS MADE.

2718,E,N,T,P,"As I said to the other guy, entps have the whole compulsive liar sociopath stereotype. Yes unhealthy people lie but in this instance what I said holds value."
2719,E,N,T,P,Of course there are situations where lying is needed. That's implied. But all of the time or compulsively isnt good.
2720,E,N,T,P,Of course some lying can be ok. But to lie all the time or for things that are unnecessary usually isnt helpful. For me if it's a conversation on something sensitive I'll just tell a person whether or not I am ok with talking about it or sharing information.
2721,E,N,T,P,You do know that this is a common stereotype with ENTPs right? The whole compulsive liar sociopath entp archetype? The unhealthy version of our selves that manipulates everyone and everything?
2722,E,N,T,P,"I'd rather be honest than dishonest as I see no point in lying. I got over my people pleasing phase back in middle school so I cant say much on the topic. 

But as an adult I can say that how I communicate my opinions is usually with 100% certainty and sometimes I share doubt or an openness to another opinion if I'm wrong. If you asked me how I was feeling I would tell you directly to your face how I felt. Even if it was negative, I dont care. But one thing I will say is I'm not perfect. I'm prideful when I shouldnt be and sometimes I start a fuss for no reason. Doesn't mean I lie to cope."
2723,E,N,T,P,I literally see no point in lying. I'd rather tell the truth than have to deal with unraveling a lie later. I tell my friends up front who I am and they accept me as I am and know I'm trying to grow. If someone wishes to only tell the truth it's not them being uncomfortable as i'm very comfortable. For you to project such a statement I'll just assume you arent comfortable with your life to support lying.

2751,E,N,T,P,"By ""studies"" I was referring to the research studies I shared with you. So I dont really get your joke?

Also in your comment before this you tell me I cant define the terms however I want because its ""factually incorrect"" to no acknowledge the differences between neurological disorders. I don't see that much of a difference as they all screw up your brain and they all tend to stick around for the rest of your life.

I personally do not agree with the movement and you cannot police my opinion. I identify with my own terms because they are the terms I grew up with and learned first. I understand your point of view and respect it. Please respect mine. 

Btw have fun with the studies."
2755,E,N,T,P,That's one of the ones I was laughing at in my head!
2756,E,N,T,P,"Just gonna say, I define adhd and etc as mental illnesses/disorder/disabilities as I dont care about the term neurodivergent. It's your choice to use that term but I personally dont identify with it.

Also I'm not calling you a mistype nor or am I saying you could be one. You dont need to prove yourself I'd rather talk about how mentally illnesses can distract you from knowing yourself.

My default personality is me off my meds. It's my natural state. My more in control personality is me on my meds. They're similar in that my ability to control my adhd is the only difference. Please stop assuming I think adhd or autism can be removed from a person as I'm not arguing that. I'm talking about when you do and don't have control, as at the end of the day you can only find ways to take the reigns of your symptoms. 

Finding out that you're mistyped is more about you not understanding yourself and NOT your neurologic problems. But if you dont understand how those can affect you you wont see how they can cause a mistyping. Personally adhd DOES affect my personality when I'm off my meds. How I act and think change. This is a common experience that many have experienced. But at the same time there are many who dont change when they're off or on meds personality wise and that's GREAT! If they dont feel that their personality isnt more or less cloudy thats great! But for me and for other people its different.

For the Se and adhd thing. I must point to the two studies that were done on adhd and mbti. Both suggested that sensors were more likely to have adhd than intuitives. But I'd love to see more studies done on this topic as only having two are really unfavorable but I digress.

Source on children with adhd:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733411/

Source for adults:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330546001_Jungian_Cognitive_Functions_Reported_MBT_as_Predictors_of_ADHD

This second one was a was an online survey from reddit and I think tumblr and a few other sites as well with alot of participants so take it with a grain of salt.

The thing with Se is the fact that it's often described as being in the moment and taking everything in and also being hands on. Honestly it sounds like how some with hyperactive adhd would experience it (especially as a child) and how it's been explained to me. I have the hyperactive variant of adhd and I very much so relate to being in the moment especially with time blindness. Off my meds I tend to be in between in the moment and also out of it stuck in a fog."

2764,I,N,T,P,"It would look silly being written as neutral neutral and also redundant. According to the chart, we are neither good nor evil, nor are we chaotic or lawful. Thus true neutral in every way"
2765,I,N,T,P,Clearly INTP
2766,I,N,T,P,Almost always XD
2767,I,N,T,P,Yea the INTP one was so inspiring to me. These are great too. Finally some good content on this sub.
2768,I,N,T,P,Thank you for introducing me to this sub lol
2769,I,N,T,P,^Agree
2770,I,N,T,P,"This rendition really captures the sense of wonder and liveliness of an intp talking about what they’re passionate about. Very nice job! And she’s cute, too :)"
2771,I,N,T,P,"Perhaps there’s a threshold and everything underneath that doesn’t really catch interest or even small ideas are gathering and collecting from many environments or scenarios. Then, all of a sudden, it comes together but then exhausts itself as soon as it’s manifest and the oscillation between inspired and “uninspired” continues."
2772,I,N,T,P,Ohh. I thought Killua was one but wasn’t sure. I don’t know the other characters..but now I do see the duality of serious and goofy
2773,I,N,T,P,Isfp? Or maybe infj.
2774,I,N,T,P,"This is the most (self-declared) istp’s I’ve seen in one comment section :0 
I didn’t know there could be more than 5 at any one time. A historical gathering!"
2775,I,N,T,P,What in the world happened to Ash’s face? XD
2776,I,N,T,P,LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS
2777,I,N,T,P,More like 101 half plans
2778,I,N,T,P,Even your reply here was :p
2779,I,N,T,P,I honestly always appreciate when someone draws my attention to a great username lol
2780,I,N,T,P,Could be yes but I was talking about an internal struggle or tension on a single cognitive function axis pair meaning it could be a struggle that applies to either a sensor or intuitive preference
2781,I,N,T,P,Fosho
2782,I,N,T,P,Lol yes it occurred to me as I was typing. Does it make the meme true? Or is it inaccurate and I’m not sure why but it also proves it true by example of me being unsure? That means I’m sure of being unsure. It’s all very paradoxical 😂😂😂😂
2783,I,N,T,P,"There’s no way this is an intuitive-only thing. Either J vs P as others have mentioned or even Ne vs Si struggle..maybe it’s low Fi...idk don’t ask me, I have the same problem XD"
2784,I,N,T,P,Oh oh. Very nice
2785,I,N,T,P,Lol I didn’t wanna be wrong is all no worries XD so it is Italy? Lol
2786,I,N,T,P,Italian? Though pizza as most people know it originated in America
2787,I,N,T,P,"Why is no one mentioning we’re missing intp, infp, and intj?"
2788,I,N,T,P,Is it even possible?
2789,I,N,T,P,"Even ENTP sarcasm isn’t straightforward, though"
2790,I,N,T,P,Can’t decide if this is a meme or a statement of fact XD
2791,I,N,T,P,"Balanced, mature thinkers will not be so rude about it while offering solutions. Feelers can be very judgy so this isn’t accurate."
2792,I,N,T,P,"Right? It survived the fridge as well, I noticed. A sturdy model if I don’t say."
2793,I,N,T,P,"Right? Clearly if it was real hard work then the assignment would’ve been included, also. 😂😂"
2794,I,N,T,P,But but IN the toaster?? XD how’d that happen?
2795,I,N,T,P,I liked these threads simply bc of these ENFP usernames LOL
2796,I,N,T,P,XD the email part seems to be drawn from personal experience
2797,I,N,T,P,Pure genius. The chaos is real
2798,I,N,T,P,😂😂because why not?
2799,I,N,T,P,I’d have to agree yesssss
2800,I,N,T,P,Good point. What do you think determines someone’s value?
2801,I,N,T,P,I thought the same thing
2802,I,N,T,P,But what if I’M being stupid or I’m joking?? That can also make me socially awkward ;)
2803,I,N,T,P,"The w means wing. Bc the enneagram has points on it like a star and the adjacent numbers are called wings. Like 4w5 or 4w3 for example. Each number represents a trait and the theory is that they are all connected somehow but for individuals it tends to be mainly 2 or 3 traits. 3 traits 4, 7, and 8 would be called a tritype"
2804,I,N,T,P,He’s just trolling you don’t worry lol
2805,I,N,T,P,"“It’s the way of the universe” was my favorite line XD 
Wow this is a lot. I see where you’re coming from. Good point about ads. 

And no I look young and get that all the time but no I’m a millennial. I just turned 28

Thanks for your reply"
2806,I,N,T,P,"Was it just you got fed up and replied to everyone on a certain post under the INTP subreddit or was it a specific topic? I’m curious to know what made such a situation in the first place. If you remember. If not, that’s ok."
2807,I,N,T,P,"I’d like to see the data on that bc my roommate is definitely that and an intp. Maybe you’re right but it seems to be a trend, at least that many introverts are night owls."
2808,I,N,T,P,Really? XD that’s so petty of them.
2809,I,N,F,P,That Hanzo/Alex movie was really cool.
2810,I,N,F,P,Well if it breaks twitter then it's probably worth it.
2811,I,N,F,P,"I got Collections pretty much just to get Trials of Mana. I remember wanting that game so much as a little kid but it never came out. The chance to finally get it was more just fulfilling a childhood dream. 

It's fun, but I would say I enjoyed the remake more. It blows the pants off the SoM remake, in any case."
2812,I,N,F,P,"I think that's right but idk for sure. I'm not sure that there are any human enemies, at least ones that are living. The ones in suits of armor even seem undead, but mind control is also a possibility.

The ninja ones are the safest bet if I had to guess, but again they could be undead or even mavolian."
2813,I,N,F,P,"I remember plugging him in the knee with the devestastor's mod. Forgot what my build was at the time but not super involved, just built it to do as much damage quickly to his right leg."
2814,I,N,F,P,"Who still sleeps with stuffed animals (and not waifu pillows)? C'mon, man."
2815,I,N,F,P,"Sounds like a bug that worked in your favor. Grats, normally it's the other way around :P"
2816,I,N,F,P,I have no idea. I was actually going to try this set out tonight when I play with some of my friends. I might borrow your build :P
2817,I,N,F,P,"So far as I know, after you get the gold medal for purifying pokemon then there's no longer any reason to do it. 

I'm no expert, that's just what the local players tell me."
2818,I,N,F,P,I have so many lucky friends that I'll never see due to distance. A means to long-distance trade would be amazing.
2819,I,N,F,P,That's what your robust and nuanced reality head canons are for ;)
2820,I,N,F,P,I literally got this mod this past weekend and it's easily one of my favorites. Having little bugs follow you around and cowabuga into enemies is more fun than I expected.
2821,I,N,F,P,"I knew it wouldn't happen but I was hoping it'd have a hookshot effect.

Would be neat if it pulled the enemy to you or you to the enemy depending on your armor weight class ;p"
2822,I,N,F,P,Weed is just the light form of Root for people who are concerned with their mental health ;)
2823,I,N,F,P,"Agree about the farmstead. Lovely and eerie map, would love to be able to set adventures there.

Also, I feel like there could be more balancing to the game. Some armor sets and weapons feel much better than others."
2824,I,N,F,P,Ethereal is the right word for it. These are lovely.
2825,I,N,F,P,"That sounds neat, I'll have to try that.

I don't have the seeker mod though, is that from smashing the iskal queen?"
2826,I,N,F,P,">Save Analyzer

I've rolled about 40 earth adventures and not seen this spawn once. I've begun to think save analyzer doesn't detect it...

But I guess I'll try again 8D"
2827,I,N,F,P,"I noticed some of my mounts are gone. If I check the shop it still registers that I have them purchased, but I can't use them in game. 

I haven't bothered to check to see if all my heroes are there. I think they are but now I'm paranoid."
2828,I,N,F,P,Looks like they're gathering that plant. Is it a common food source?
2829,I,N,F,P,Grats! I love these little golden eggs. Haven't found one yet though.
2830,I,N,F,P,That Star Fox pic is cool.
2831,I,N,F,P,I'm fine with being a fairy if it means I can fly.
2832,I,N,F,P,"*BLM has been burning down buildings*

*But, do you know why?!*

How very well trained. Been seeing this angle pushed by pop media. I remember back before the 2016 elections, pop news was concern trolling everyone with how 'violent' the right might get when Trump loses. 

Even if that did hypothetically happen, I'm sure they wouldn't focus on *why* the violence and destruction was happening as much as the fact that it was happening. 

These girls are the NPC meme in real time."
2833,I,N,F,P,"Thanks, these are very helpful :)"
2834,I,N,F,P,"I'm not completely sure how it works. My sense is that it's a mechanic intended to differentiate between dodging actual incoming attacks vs dodging just for the sake of it (like at the ward or somewhere safe). Just pushing the dodge button to accrue benefits wouldn't make a lot of sense so there's some kind of mechanic to determine when you're doing it to actually avoid getting hit.

I'm just not sure what that window looks like. I thought at first it was dodging at the last possible split second, but it seems more forgiving than that, thankfully. But, not as forgiving as I'd hope. Sometimes I feel I dodge an attack by the skin of my teeth and I get no benefit at all. It's likely not as close as I perceive, I guess, but earning the bonus is not super obvious to me."
2835,I,N,F,P,"When I first got the Devestator I couldn't see myself using it at all. After getting the reload speed trait and maxxing it out, it's incredible. I really want to see how well it works with slayer+akari reload speed bonuses. 

I had to look up the [Akari Warband](https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/Akari+War+Band). Looks great but idk if I'll get good enough to kill stuff on Hardcore mode. That or I should migrate to mouse + keyboard to play 🤔"
2836,I,N,F,P,"I'll look into those, thanks. I only just started Subj 2923 expansion and got to Rhesium last night. Some equipment I don't have yet but I will hunt for it."
2837,I,N,F,P,"I think you're right. I recently just got this the other day and have been meaning to experiment with it but haven't done so yet.

There's another piece of gear that gives you health regen on perfect dodge iirc. I can't remember what it was right now.

EDIT: It's [burden of the reckless](https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/Burden+of+the+Reckless) that grants the health regen, as mentioned above."
2838,I,N,F,P,"I don't use this gun when playing with friends. One specifically prefers to melee 60% of the time, can't risk hitting him all the time lol.

Shame that it's more effective against allies than enemies though. I guess it's an indirect buff to the *Suspicion* trait?? ;p"
2839,I,N,F,P,"I have a ton of alolan raichu and it's not one I particularly like. I like shedinja's appearance and theme more, but I like creepy and weird characters in game.

Even though it's not particularly useful now, things in this game change over time so I don't judge pokemon I like too harshly if their use is low."
2840,I,N,F,P,I should have waited. I did mine after midnight and it was still raichu :\\
2841,I,N,F,P,God I wish I had someone in my life to help me keep focused.
2842,I,N,F,P,"Happened to me. I got an egg one Monday morning and was shocked, that's how I learned you could even get eggs that way. 

Too bad most things I hatch are 2\* trash anyway, but I neglect opening presents on Sunday even just to avoid missing out on weekly rewards now."
2843,I,N,F,P,Probably has more to do with how insane and cancerous the left has become. Getting fired for sharing the wrong political opinion or being threatened with violence for not saying 'their names' or wtf has made navigating the political landscape far more difficult.
2844,I,N,F,P,Knowing when to run is thinking like a rogue ;)
2845,I,N,F,P,*Optipression.*
2846,I,N,F,P,There's a dick princess? how?
2847,I,N,F,P,"Ugh happens way too much. 

Sometimes I get in the zone though and can focus really well. I'm not sure why that is but I'd love to figure it out someday."
2848,I,N,F,P,"I like it! Is that flash in the center from the camera or is it a photoshop effect of some kind? Looks like it could be incidental or intended.

Made me think of John the Baptist, but idk if he technically counts as a prophet."
2849,I,N,F,P,"Which would you rather fight:

* 1 normal sized Ryo
* 5 little Ryos"
2850,I,N,F,P,"I'm vaguely reminded of Cho'Gall with these guys. 

Looks great :)"
2851,I,N,F,P,"True but Muradin is a good place to start if someone does want to learn tanking eventually. Very forgiving. 

Also, *Take this ya bastard!* is one of the best lines in the game."
2852,I,N,F,P,A lot of ppl like Jaina or Li Ming. They're good but I'd recommend staying away from Gul'dan despite him being the only mage I like playing. His Life Tap trait requires some high awareness and planning in the absence of a careful healer.
2853,I,N,F,P,"If I were rich, I could see myself doing this only for the purpose of donating it to a museum or something."
2854,I,N,F,P,"The park near my house has this happen about twice a month. Only 2 gyms there, but every now and then I see they were knocked down but never taken. I almost always throw my shoes on and head over."
2855,I,N,F,P,"I guess Magneton is a trinity, Magnezone is a holy trinity?"
2856,I,N,F,P,"I never actually bothered with the cannibal trait. Seemed too niche, but how useful is it?"
2857,I,N,F,P,Yes? I'm not overtly suffering but experiencing discontent with the sense I'm not meeting my potential.
2858,I,N,F,P,"I always figured none of the characters were infps, but all of them were written by infps.

Except Frodo. I think we get to have him."

2869,I,N,T,P,Sir that's called a period
2870,I,N,T,P,"As a girl I can also point out that some of us respond with ""if you're ugly what am I?"""
2871,I,N,T,P,"I agree that the LN is the best source. Usually I'm a manga-only and I'm very biased towards manga, but the LN provides the best interpretation of the story and shows the monologue and story better than the manga (mainly because the story is very monologue heavy which really only works in light novels and not so much in manga)"
2872,I,N,T,P,"Citrus+. It's a spin-off of the popular yuri manga, Citrus, and this was from the latest chapter."
2873,I,N,T,P,Harley Quinn >>
2874,I,N,T,P,"I mean, I can't speak for all girls, but they are horny and they definitely do masturbate and some watch porn. In general, I don't think they're as horny as guys (just because it's a hormone thing I think? Girls in general are less horny but it doesn't mean they're not). 

I've never heard of any girls seriously doing NNN and for the most part I think they just think it's dumb or they just don't care about it."
2875,I,N,T,P,"Multiple friends of mine have confirmed that I sound more awkward in person, unfortunately :')"
2876,I,N,T,P,"Me, a girl:"
2877,I,N,T,P,It’s funny because one of my close friends is always desperate to video call me instead of texting but I insist that we have to text because I literally cannot converse face to face without sounding awkward
2878,I,N,T,P,Nice. I've only heard Estrelar from him (which is a great song as well) but this one definitely gives off the city pop vibes.
2879,I,N,T,P,"we did it boys, homophobia is no more"
2880,I,N,T,P,sad but true
2881,I,N,T,P,"There's lots of yuri manga that you can read on Mangadex or Dynasty Scans (or some other sites as well). You'll find tons of recommendations on this sub or other yuri subs as well (my personal favorites are Tamen de Gushi, Ouji-sama Nante Iranai, Citrus, and Blooming Sequence). Just search up the manga name + manga/manhwa/manhua and you can find it."
2882,I,N,T,P,with religious intent
2883,I,N,T,P,by your logic does that mean you're a toaster oven?
2884,I,N,T,P,oh right la bise? yes.

2886,I,N,T,P,it takes forever to brush in the morning and then it ends up looking gross later on anyway even though you did nothing to it

3009,I,N,T,P,"Everybody knows INTPs don't have physical bodies. We're just brains floating in jars that sensors carry around to move us from place to place, or human brains inside vestigial fetus bodies."
3010,I,N,T,P,Thinkers can be just as depressed as feelers. INxx types are probably the most likely to have existential depression.
3011,I,N,T,P,"That would be the true spirit of wholesome memes, or the intention that wholesome memes started out with, but most wholesome memes today aren't that profound anymore. Most of them don't have a core message and are aggressively trivial and shallow. Like the memes that tell people to stay hydrated or portray something that's superficially cute. 

Maybe they help some people, but they always have the opposite effect on me. It's impossible for me to get self-worth from a meme that gives no real explanation for why I should have any self-worth to begin with. Wholesome memes never explain why you should be nice to yourself or others, they just tell you that you should, in a really pushy and forced way. If a meme tells me that I should love myself or that everything is gonna be ok without giving a rational explanation for why I should love myself or why things will be ok, then I immediately doubt everything about those sentiments and become even more bitter and oppositional. Plus wholesome memes have become so oversaturated and preachy that they have become like authoritarian propaganda campaigns."
3012,I,N,T,P,"As an INTP who has dated another INTP, it's always cool, interesting, and low-pressure. But you should not have a relationship with an INTP girl/guy just because you think their mannerisms are cute. INTPs can be super incompatible with people who do not understand how they function. If you expect to have a ""normal"" relationship with an INTP, have traditional values about gender roles, expect them to change for you, try to force them to be more outgoing, try to ""fix"" them, get offended when they periodically disappear to do their own thing, or create a bunch of rules and obligations that you expect them to adhere to in the relationship, then you're gonna have a bad time. From what I've seen, INTPs have the most stable and understanding relationships with INTJs, INFJs, INFPs, ENTPs, sometimes ENTJs, occasionally ENFPs, and of course other INTPs."
3013,I,N,T,P,Ghost time!
3014,I,N,T,P,"Female INFP is more doomer than male INFP, but male INTP is more doomer than female INTP. It's also funny how ENTPs are more doomer than INTJs."
3015,I,N,T,P,"I don't understand the submitting to loved ones thing. I never do what my loved ones say, I always argued with my family or would just disappear when they wanted something from me."
3016,I,N,T,P,"INTJs and INFJs seem to ""realize"" a lot of unpleasant truths at some point in their lives and they take it really personally for some reason and exaggerate those negative aspects in their minds, especially INTJs. INFPs also often take negative aspects of human nature personally and become irrationally distrustful of people. INTPs usually don't ""realize"" things about human nature, life, mortality, or meaning, in the same way as INTJs, INFJs, and INFPs do, they are just always aware of the reality and don't take anything personally. Like I'm never distrustful of people because I don't perceive deceitfulness as inherently bad or scary, I know that most people act in self interest including myself, and that if I end up getting tricked, it's just because they were able to outwit me, and I may have done the same thing if I were in their position. I never fully trust or distrust people, but I assume that most people are nice and have friendly intentions because most people I have met in my life do."
3017,I,N,T,P,"I hate ""wholesome"" memes so much, dude. Aggressive or intrusive acts of kindness are not wholesome, they're annoying and not everyone appreciates them. You are also not obligated to give people your good-will or be generous and supportive at all times. Being ""wholesome"" is not cool and it's not the same as actually doing good for humanity. It's cool to do good things out a genuine selfless love for all humanity, but acting like a savior figure to one single person, boosting their ego, and calling them queen or sista is not admirable or inspiring."
3018,I,N,T,P,IxxPs are the most individualistic in their relationship to society and others so they would have the least inclination to police others or care about how other people behave. And xNTPs thrive in chaos. So both of those factors compound to make INTPs very unlikely to want to regulate anyone.
3019,I,N,T,P,"I can't tell if this is trolling or if it's serious. I don't think anyone dissed Hitler's paintings, and I don't think Hitler ever murdered anyone over his paintings, he just failed to get into art school when he was young. Hitler became radicalized during and after WW1 when he saw Germany lose and get exploited by other European nations. He was also hyper-nationalistic in a time when people were looking for scapegoats for political and economic problems. 

I never said what MBTI type I thought Hitler was, I was making a point about the fact that the original poster doesn't understand what authoritarian regimes are and has a hyper-caricatured idea of dictatorships."
3020,I,N,T,P,Dogs are annoying. I prefer cats.
3021,I,N,T,P,"Stop using 18 as some kind of milestone of human development. It's just an arbitrary number. Milestones of human development are 12, 14, 16, 21, and 25. The average person in the US loses their virginity at around 16."
3022,I,N,T,P,"You know actual fascist dictatorships don't care about most of those things. Even Hitler didn't stop people from drinking or partying. Authoritarians only care about power hierarchies, maintaining order, and pushing a nationalist agenda. ""Maintaining order"" never means banning people from having fun, it just means securing the power of certain groups or institutions and making sure the people are brainwashed. I don't know what kind of society you're thinking of where fun isn't allowed, but it's not one that can actually exist."
3023,I,N,T,P,"As an INTP, I feel this. INTPs are often aloof, detached, non-social, and somewhat nihilistic, but every once in a while they can be struck with an overwhelming love for all humanity, at least that's how it happens with me. Where I look at everyone and think ""I love all of you, and I love being a human being"""
3024,I,N,T,P,"This is the only version of this meme where the introverted version gets called a donkey instead of the extroverted one. Why exactly would they hate us though? INFPs, ENTPs, and INTJs all seem to like INTPs and get along well with them. What is it that makes INFJs dislike INTPs? I know ENFPs are likely to dislike INTPs as well."
3025,I,N,T,P,"INTJs are a lot less self-aware about a lot of things than INTPs, but I think they are better at grasping social norms. INTPs usually insecure or in denial about being weird, it's just that because they don't notice how other people act and arent concerned about acting in a ""proper"" or ""acceptable"" way, they don't initially realize how different they are. Once they realize it though, they usually just accept it. While INTJs might not like to admit they're weird, they are still more aware of social conventions than INTPs. They don't always follow the social conventions or agree with them, but they are aware of what they are without having to suddenly discover it. They also don't behave as abnormally as INTPs on average, since their auxiliary function is Te, which seeks order, and they have inferior Se which makes them especially cautious about what they are doing all times, which is why INTJs seem more ridged in their posture and the way they carry themselves."
3026,I,N,T,P,"That makes sense. I don't have a lot of experience with many other Ti doms. The one other INTP that I knew would always tell people what he was feeling honest because he always wanted to tell the truth as he saw it so he would talk about his own feelings from an analytical 3rd person perspective, he also had a bad perception of social cues and he didn't really care what other people thought of him so he didn't really feel ashamed about many things. I have also met an INFP who was ashamed to be seen as weak or vulnerable because she had very high standards for herself. So I'm sure it depends more on each person's individual idiosyncrasies than on personality type."
3027,I,N,T,P,"Really? I wouldn't think it's shameful. I would think that TJ types would be more reluctant to admit they have personal problems or struggle with depression because they have high Te, they seem to emanate an aura of competence and like to have things under control. ISTJs might not want to admit it because it deviates from social norms and would make them seem abnormal or needy, ESTJs and ENTJs might not want to admit it out of pride or because they don't want to admit that they aren't in control, INTJs might not want to admit it because it might make them seem incompetent and they don't want to rely on other people. ISTJs and INTJs are usually able to recognize and admit to themselves that they have a problem but are reluctant to admit it to others, while ESTJs and ENTJs who have inferior Fi, are likely to be unaware that they have a problem in the first place or unable to fully acknowledge it. Among TP types, ESTPs and ISTPs might reluctant to tell other people out of pride, not because they don't want to rely on others, but because they don't want others to see them as flawed or vulnerable. ENTPs are more likely not to admit they have a problem to others because they don't that they have it in the first place. Unlike ExTJs, ENTPs are aware that there is something wrong with them, but they don't like that fact and don't want to address it. Unlike xSTPs, ENTPs also don't want to hide it out of pride, or because they don't want to appear weak, they hide it out of spite and frustration that they have that problem in the first place, ENTPs don't want to bring it up because they think that if they ignore it it will go away. INTPs are also aware when they have a problem, but they are skeptical that other people would have any ability to fix it. INTPs often see their depression or anxiety as a fundamental part of themselves and something that cannot be changed. The reason INTPs wouldn't share those things with other people is not out of pride, shame, or a fear of being vulnerable, but out of a sense that other people wouldn't be able to help and would just complicate things. As an INTP, I often have this feeling that it's futile to ask for help, but I do it anyway because other people can often have helpful insights and if you tell people that care about you, they could prevent you from taking any drastic actions that you might regret in the future."
3028,I,N,T,P,"That's a very ISTP response. 

Petrol - A chemical that can have many uses"
3029,I,N,T,P,"For me, it started when I was 8. But it depends on the person. Many people get that sort of existential anxiety between the time they're 12 and 15, because that's when you go through puberty and start relating your life to events and ideas in the outside world or thinking about who you are and what your life means to you. But if you have a tendency to look for meaning in things and think about concepts in like life and existence in-depth, then it's possible to get existential anxiety or depression as soon as you're able to reason at an advanced enough level. For me it was because I first started to grasp the concept of consciousness, death, and mortality around the time I was 8. I always understood that living things die and I never believed in an afterlife or anything like that because my family was not religious, and I remember always having both a fear and a curiosity about death. But it wasn't until that point that I was able to fully comprehend consciousness and the concept of nothingness, or of no longer being conscious. I remember around that time, when I was 8 or 9, I started refusing to sleep because I didn't want to fade away into a void where I was no longer conscious and I had a paranoid thought that I was could be dreaming and not know it or that I had no idea whether anything I experienced was real."
3030,I,N,T,P,"ISTP: Makes sharp blunt remarks about shooting themselves or cynical/snarky remarks about wanting to die. You can tell they are not serious because you know that if ISTP was serious they wouldn't tell anyone. 

ISFP: Jokes about not wanting to live anymore or wishing they were dead. You can tell that they are just joking and not serious about suicide, but you can still tell it comes from a place of sadness. 

INFP: Makes very disturbing allusions or references to suicide that completely shock everyone and subvert the general mood of a conversation. Unlike the ISFP, they don't actually intend to shock people, they just want to express feelings of self-loathing in a self-deprecating way for the sake of humor. INFP suicide jokes are usually self-deprecating in nature and seem to come from a surprisingly honest and genuine sense of self-loathing. But you can usually tell when they're serious and when they're joking.

INTP: Makes nihilistic or cynical jokes about suicide, usually talking about suicide in the abstract, devaluing life, and providing death as an alternative. Unlike the other types, the INTPs jokes are not blunt or immediately shocking, but instead, they linger in the air and slowly cause a dark creeping feeling of dread, unease, or melancholy, to fall over everyone in the room. INTP will talk about suicide with a completely straight face and a sense of apathy, so you have absolutely no idea if they are joking or serious. 

ISTP: Shocks people

ISFP: Makes people feel bad for them

INFP: Makes people concerned for their mental state and shocks them

INTP: Makes people depressed and unsettled"
3031,I,N,T,P,"INFxs often feel pity for ENTPs. INTPs, like them and think they're cool, as well as some ISTPs, ESTPs, and INTJs. But all xSxJs and many ENxJs pretty much see them as Hisoka, the Joker, or some other demented clown."
3032,I,N,T,P,"I first started thinking about death and mortality when I was 8, in 2nd grade. I don't understand how or where you acquire this information. How is this so accurate? Is this something that happens in INxx types? And if so, why?"
3033,I,N,T,P,"For me, it was 8. I first started thinking about death and mortality in 2nd grade. I don't understand how or where you acquire this information. How is this so accurate? Is this something that happens in INxx types? And if so, why?"
3034,I,N,T,P,"Thanks. I find it hard to be reminded of the past because I have a tendency to blame myself for my own misery. But I guess if I can look to the future or try to live in the present, I can eventually forget and move on to a point in life where what I see as the recent past does not include that relationship. I year is a long time when it comes to human relations and friendships, but it's a very short time in the course of a human life and things that happened a year ago still feel like a recent memory. Maybe in a few years from now, it will feel like a much more distant memory and it will seem less important."
3035,I,N,T,P,"Technically nothing is ""normal"". Normal in this case is just used to describe behaviors that are socially normative or common, basically things that do not deviate from the more common social perceptions of how a person should live in a given society. Of course, everyone has their own unique idiosyncrasies that are not exactly in line with what is common, but some people are better at integrating into society and appearing socially normative to others."
3036,I,N,T,P,"I guess I just assumed that ENTPs would be somewhat similar to INTPs. I have known many INTPs that have used Adderall, including myself, and didn't like it. Adderall helps you focus on tasks and details but it narrows your scope of perception and blocks creativity. But ENTPs are slightly more action-oriented than INTPs so maybe they like the euphoria and the feeling of doing things. It also might have a different effect on people with and without ADHD. I personally would rather sit around and think about things before actually doing anything and when I actually accomplish something I like to sit back and reflect on what I did and think about the future possibilities that it could imply. Adderall just gives you an overwhelming sense of urgency which I hate, and makes you feel like you NEED to do something, even if that thing is pointless and stupid."
3037,I,N,T,P,"Adderall is supposed to make you more efficient and focused, so it makes sense that TJ types would like it, especially STJ types. But I have never liked the effect of Adderall. As someone who has ADHD and has taken amphetamines, I absolutely hate them. They make you more focused and efficient, but they narrow your scope of perception, make you think in a more rigid and linear way, destroy creativity, and block out curiosity. I have never valued efficiency or achievement and I derive the most joy in life out of curiosity, learning, creativity, and things that give me a sense of wonder, which is stereotypical of INTPs. Adderall literally gives the opposite experience, it drags me back down to earth and makes me overly focused on details and trivial things. Amphetamines are like the opposite of escapism. 

It's funny how amphetamines are considered one of the most addictive substances known to humans, but I've noticed that I and people like me don't like their effect and thus, don't get addicted to them. It's an example of how different people are more susceptible to different drugs based on their personalities. As someone who is neurotic, gets overwhelmed easily, and uses escapism to retreat from the outside world and ignore life, depressant drugs are much more appealing to me than stimulant drugs. I'm not old enough to buy alcohol on my own, since you have to be 21 in the US, but every time that I have been around alcohol I would continue drinking and wasn't able to stop until I had drank everything that was available. So I should probably watch myself around alcohol when I get older. My grandfather was also a hypersensitive introverted person, he was an INFP, and he had a massive problem with alcohol as well. Which is why I listed a bunch of depressant drugs like alcohol, morphine, opium, and heroin, for INFPs and INTPs, but left out amphetamines."
3038,I,N,T,P,"INTPs would be somewhere in the middle or upper left of this graph. We are rarely confused about our own identities because Ti is good at building a framework for understanding ourselves rationally just like Fi is good at understanding one's self emotionally. INTPs are also good at knowing and admitting they have a problem, but they are bad at asking for help because we either don't understand how another person could help us or we don't see our personal problems as solvable. INFPs are also bad at asking for help with personal problems because they also often see their problems as unsolvable or they see their emotional issues as a part of their identity. So with INTPs and INFPs, they fully understand who they are and are usually fully aware of what their problems are, but they either see their problems as a fundamental part of who they are or they simply don't believe that anyone else can help them with their problems. INFPs are more likely to believe that their problems are a part of who they are and INTPs are more likely to be skeptical that those problems can even be solved."
3039,I,N,T,P,My INFP mom losing an argument: Why you bully me?
3040,I,N,T,P,"hmm, that's probably why she was mad. She always hated that I would disappear and reappear without warnings. That was part of the reason we broke up in the first place. I tried to explain to her that I get depressed sometimes and withdraw away from other people without leaving my room until the depression passes, but she didn't really understand. I texted her again after a year because I came out of a long depression and finally wanted to look towards the future and reenter the world, so I texted her to reconvene with my past and make sure that I was still on good terms with people from my past so that I could feel like the things I left behind me were ok and the memories were not ones I should regret, so that I can finally feel comfortable moving forward into the future. Basically, I wanted to make sure there wasn't any regret or sadness from my past lingering within myself or anyone else, so that I could feel like I left everything in an ok state, things were resolved or forgotten, and I could move on with only happy memories. But now that I know she hates me for some reason or is at the very least angry at me, it basically reversed everything and now I stuck thinking about the past again and too depressed to look forward. 

She was also my first and only girlfriend, which makes it worse because I have no idea what a ""normal"" breakup is supposed to be like anyway. If relationships cause this much misery, I don't think I ever want to love anyone again. We broke up in high school and this is my first year of college, so while I don't feel like moving on with my life and I just want to ignore the world forever, I'm forced into a new environment with new people anyway, which is a much more uncomfortable setting to be brooding about my past in. All because I formed a deep connection with this girl, parted ways with her, found out she's mad at me for some unspecified reason that is out of my control, and I am unable to live my life with that knowledge or my memories of what we had before. I didn't even bring this fate upon myself. I didn't just decide to start a relationship or become attached to this girl, it just happened on its own. Out of all anomalies and idiosyncrasies of the human condition, love has to be the most pointlessly cruel and unfair of them all."
3041,I,N,T,P,"That's wise. I am more curious and experimental with drugs because I like the idea of altering my state of consciousness and since I'm in college, I want to explore any new experience that can alter my perception of things. But I'm always wary around alcohol because of my grandfather. I only drank a few times in high school and once this year, and each time I wasn't able to stop and I just drank everything that was available. Once I got my hands on a bottle of vodka and I planned to only take one or two shots to calm my anxiety because I had to write an essay, but I ended up drinking the entire bottle which was half a liter of vodka. I still wrote the essay while I was drunk, and I surprisingly got a really good grade on it. I guess that means I must have inherited my grandfather's ability to think and write while being drunk. I could barely walk after I finished the bottle, but I could still somehow speak and write well. But looking back I was lucky that I was at home where my parents could stop me from drinking, because if I had unrestricted access to alcohol I would probably continue drinking for years like my grandfather did. So while I like the idea of trying new mind-altering substances while I'm in college, I'm going to watch myself around alcohol."
3042,I,N,T,P,"Well on average it is true. That's not to say INTPs don't have mental ability to begin with, since numerous studies have shown that INTPs score the highest of all the MBTI types on IQ tests and other cognitive tests. And while INTPs do value their intellect just as much as INTJs, if not more, they tend not to value their efficiency or productivity as much. INTPs don't take their mental abilities for granted, it's just that they function differently. INTPs don't feel as much of a need for control as INTJs do, and because of how their minds function, they can often get overwhelmed by their own thoughts as well as the outside world which makes them more likely to indulge in escapism. INFPs are similar in that sense, which is why there were so many INFP writers and poets who were alcoholics, like Edgar Allan Poe."
3043,I,N,T,P,"It's different for everyone. Many INFPs don't like alcohol at all because it tastes bitter and makes them more likely to accidentally hurt themselves or be more vulnerable in general. Because many INFPs are very sensitive, they may not like the taste of alcohol because the bitter taste is not soothing, and because INFPs are prone to anxiety and neurosis they may find the idea of losing control of themselves to be scarry and unsettling. My mom is an INFP and she doesn't drink because she doesn't like the taste and I have an INFP friend who doesn't want to try alcohol because she is afraid of losing awareness of her surroundings. But while many INFPs hate alcohol, there are also many INFPs as well as INTPs who are at a more severe risk of alcoholism. Because INFPs are more likely to be sensitive, anxious, neurotic, and get emotionally overwhelmed easily, many of them find the numbing effect of alcohol to be an escape from reality, and escape from fear, and an escape from pain. For a similar reason, INTPs are likely to use alcohol to quiet the millions of thoughts running through their mind, numb their sadness, their sense of existential depression or dread, or simply escape from life. 

My grandfather is an example of how some INFPs can become dependent on alcohol. My grandfather was a very successful journalist in the Soviet Union and won national awards for journalism and was recognized as one other best journalist in Soviet Armenia. He was a very gentle and sensitive person, which meant that his job writing about politics, political tensions, wars, and the general state of human affairs took a toll on his mental wellbeing. He was entrusted to disclose information honestly to the people of his nation and it often put him in conflict with the local government. So he was often very melancholy and drank alcohol to make him forget his sorrows. He was drunk almost every day of his life for 30 years before quitting. He would often drink until he passed out in his office, bars, government buildings, and sometimes out in the middle of the street, and he would often have to be carried home by Soviet police because he was too drunk to walk.

This is common with many historic writers who were INFPs. Edgar Allan Poe was one of the greatest poets in history and he was an alcoholic. Although he was a genius writer, he had a notoriously short life and died early from alcohol poisoning. Michael Bulgakov was one of the most famous writers of the 20th century, he was an INFP, and he was a morphine addict. Morphine is a depressant and has a similar effect to alcohol, but stronger."
3044,I,N,T,P,"I know that INTJs deeply value their own mental ability and competence. That's why I listed INTJ as the only INxx type that doesn't abuse alcohol. INTJs often drink caffeine because it can boost alertness and productivity, and smoking tabacco doesn't interfere with your mental ability like other drugs do, so out of all drugs that people take for pleasure, smoking tobacco would be the most appealing on to an INTJ. The other 3 drugs,  psilocybin, DMT, and LSD, are not addictive and not used for enjoyment. Psilocybin, DMT, and LSD are hallucinogenic psychoactive substances that alter your perceptions of reality, existence, time and space. Many intellectuals use these psychoactive substances ether to explore the inner workings of their own mind or broaden their perspectives and allow them to experience new ways of thinking about things. So naturally, I listed various hallucinogens like these for all the INxx types, as well as ENTP and ENFP."
3045,I,N,T,P,"MBTI types on a rollercoaster:

INTJ: Is most displeased by the inconvenience and sincerely not amused

INFP: Looks down and wonders what would happen if they fell out. Wonders what would happen if they unbuckled their safety belt. Wonders if this is what confronting death feels like.

ISFJ: Cries and pees their pants.

ESFJ: Cries and throws up.

ESTP: Threatens to unbuckle their own safety belt so they can surf on the moving ride and see other people's reactions.

ENTP: Threatens to unbuckle the person next to them to mess with them and see their reaction.

ISTP: Actually unbuckled their own safety belt with no one noticing, so that they can feel free and look into the face of death with honor.

INTP: Doesn't know why they're there in the first place and just falls asleep on the roller coaster while listening to the sound of the tracks."
3046,I,N,T,P,"My ex was an INTJ and she was friendly with me right after we broke up and we agreed to still be on friendly terms. But I texted her back a year later to ask how her life was going and apparently she hates me now and doesn't want to talk to me. I have no idea why she suddenly hates me, since I haven't said anything to her in all that time and we were on good terms after we broke up. Maybe she thinks that I ""don't have the right"" to suddenly text her again after not talking to her for over a year, I know she always hated it when I would randomly disappear and then reappear again without warning. Or maybe she got over the relationship and doesn't want to be reminded of it anymore. I can never know because she would rarely ever share her feelings with people, and when she did, she gave very short non-detailed descriptions and wouldn't elaborate on anything. 

I've never met an INFJ though. I don't really know what they are like."
3047,I,N,T,P,"Ni sounded a lot like Si and Te, but that makes sense because Ni is future-oriented and anticipates future outcomes. 

But she severely mischaracterized Ti though. I think this lady claims to be an INTJ, so it makes sense that she doesn't have a good personal understanding of what Ti actually is. She portrayed Ti as a competitive person who claims to be the best at doing ""camping things"" out of pride or something. Ti is an internal framework of logic, I don't think people with high Ti are very competitive or prideful. I don't think proving that you are the best at building a fire is something that would appease Ti. That sounds like either Se or Te."
3048,I,N,T,P,"Oh yeah. That's probably due to dominant Ti and auxiliary Ne. Ti creates a subjective internal system of logic while Ne lets them conceptualize many different future outcomes and frequently switch up their strategy whenever it seems advantageous or they see an opportunity to change strategies. In contrast, INTJs use Ni to predict their opponent's next moves and Te to plan out intricate strategies and counter-strategies. ENTPs use the same two top functions as INTPs but they are reversed, where they lead with Ne and support it with Ti. So while INTPs will first create a logical set of principles for a baseline strategy and then improve upon the strategy, deviate from their strategy only to return to it later, or cleverly alter between different strategies, ENTPs will first think about all the possibilities for how they can move, then think of a logical move without creating any sort of baseline strategy to play with. An ENTP may come up with a strategy halfway through the game but they usually just use dominant Ne to see all the possible move options, use Ti to analyze those options, and will only plan one or two moves in advance to keep their options open. This is why ENTPs are usually not as good at chess as INTPs or INTJs. Because ENTPs don't start out with any kind of baseline strategy and only plan a few moves ahead, they cannot deceive their opponent by changing their playstyle because their opponent can tell that they are just reacting to each move as it comes. I'm an INTP but I have ADHD so my playstyle is like the ENTP playstyle. I also have a very short attention span so I usually get beaten at chess, by both humans and computers.

In my experience, INTJs are typically the best at chess among all intuitives, while ENFPs and ENFJs are the worst.

When playing an INTJ, you should be aware that they have an intricate plan for offense and defense, they will make it very hard for you to attack them, they plan out all their contingencies to achieve a flawless strategy, and they can predict all your future moves if you stick with the same strategy. INTJs can learn your strategy very quickly and predict what you will do, but they are much slower at changing up their own strategy. So if you want to beat an INTJ, you have to either find a flaw in their defenses, which is very difficult to do, or shift your strategy at key moments in the game to confuse them. While they are confused and trying to figure out your new strategy they are vulnerable to attack, so you can that moment to attack a weak point in their defenses.

When Playing an INTP, you should be aware that they have a baseline strategy or set of logical principles that dictate how they will play. You can try to figure out what that baseline strategy is, but it's very difficult unless you know exactly how their thought process works. If you can observe a consistent pattern to how they are playing, you can identify what they're trying to do and predict their next moves, but if they suddenly shift their playstyle and do something unpredictable do not let it confuse or discourage you. If they suddenly alter their strategy and you can't figure out what they're doing, don't overwhelm yourself trying to figure it out, because it's probably impossible to know what they're planning at that point. It may have been calculated and it may have just been a random diversion, but if you focus too much on trying to figure out their strategy, you will leave yourself vulnerable to their attacks. One thing to know about the INTP, is that they are not playing mind games where they spend their energy trying to predict what you will do and plan their strategy around that, they construct their strategy like an algorithm, completely independent from what they think you might do. They start out with an algorithm that they think will optimize their offenses and defenses and then as you move through the game, they alter and change that algorithm based on patterns they notice and optimize it for the highest potential options for attack and the lowest vulnerability in their defense. While they won't spend time trying to predict your strategy, because INTPs are generally bad at reading people, they can intentionally use deception. For example, they can observe patterns in the way you play and infer what those patterns are designed to accomplish, and then intentionally subvert those patterns. Or if they realize that you are responding in a calculated and deliberate way to their moves, they will make a series of unpredictable moves to throw you off. But because INTPs are so flexible with their strategy and are immediately aware of new opportunities, the best way to beat an INTP is to lead them into a trap. But this trap cannot take a long time to plan or require many moves to construct, because the INTP will notice the odd patterns and get suspicious. If you use too many moves that are neither offensive or defensive for the purpose of constructing a trap, the INTP will notice what you're doing and analyze the board until they find the trap. The trap has to be set quickly in just a few moves, or you have to make it look like it aligns with either your offensive or defensive strategy.

So basically:

To beat an INTJ: Have a flexible strategy and change up your playstyle often. Do not try to out-plan them and do not expect them to walk into traps. Do not let them figure out your strategy. Use confusion and deception. Try to find weak points in their defenses when they are confused.

To beat an INTP: Have a flexible general-purpose strategy that does not rely on your opponent behaving in a predictable or consistent way. Do not try to out-think them and do not expect them to follow a consistent plan. Do not get confused or distracted when they alter their playstyle and do not lose focus on your defenses. When their focus shifts and they are considering different possibilities, use this time to construct struct traps. Lead them into traps that take only a few moves so that they don't have time to recognize or identify the pattern."
3049,I,N,T,P,"I'm more familiar with intuitives, and while there certainly are sensors who exhibit unique behaviors, it's usually intuitives who are more stereotypically eccentric and deviate from normal behavior. Sensors are more common among the general population and are generally better at fitting in among society. 

However, among the sensors, the most individualist sensors that deviate the most from social norms are probably the IxxPs, like ISFPs and ISTPs. Since ISFPs use Fi and pride themselves in their individuality and authenticity just like INFPs, and ISTPs have inferior Fe just like INTPs so they often don't notice what others think of them and are unaware of social norms. ESTPs and ESFPs are also very unpredictable and very action-oriented, so they may have personality traits and behaviors that are socially abrasive or extreme. And while ISTJs have a good grasp of social norms due to their high Si, they are not as good at connecting to people directly because they lack Fe, unlike ISFJs, and they can often have strange and atypical hobbies and interests that they are very invested in.

The most non-conformist sensors are ISFPs. The most atypical and individualistic sensors are ISTPs. The most unpredictable and extreme personalities among sensors belong to ESTPs and ESFPs. And the sensors with the strangest interests, hobbies, or obsessions, are ISTJs along with ISTPs."
3050,I,N,T,P,"That's true, INTPs are often bad at initiating conversation and rarely do. They have inferior Fe so they are bad at reading social cues, they lead with Ti so they spend most of their time alone thinking about things, and they have auxiliary Ne, so they are often only interested in conversations if they are deep, insightful, or satisfy their curiosity. So their conversations with people are often one-sided. A conversation with an INTP can go two ways; either one person leads the conversation and asks all the questions while the INTP just listens and replies, or if the conversation centers on something that the INTP is interested in, the INTP can start talking excessively about that thing and spend an extremely long time explaining that concept in length without letting the other person talk. Because INTPs are bad at reading social cues, they can sometimes unintentionally monopolize conversations and not let other people get a word in, almost as if they are having a conversation with themselves and the other person just forced to listen to their inner dialogue. So depending on the INTP and depending on the situation, it can alternate between quiet listening and deranged rambling."
3051,I,N,T,P,"INFPs are definitely complicated people, but I've never met an INFP that has described themselves as ""deep"". Taking pictures of flowers and seashells seems like more of an ISFP thing to do. INFPs are not as sentimental about physical images or experiences."
3052,I,N,T,P,"I know. But it's usually self-evident that these memes are about unhealthy versions of these types. When people talk about the ""evil villain"" archetypes of INTJs or the aloof disinterested persona of the INTP, they are talking about extreme one-dimensional versions of those types. So I'm sure not all relationships between xNTJs and xNTPs are out of pure self-interest."
3053,I,N,T,P,"I don't understand this stereotype or why it exists. INFJ's have some of the highest abilities to see and understand a person's true nature, so if you were really a psychopath, they would be the first to get vibes that you don't actually care about people. And INFPs are individualist and self-serving by their very nature, since they use Fi instead of Fe. All IxxP types are notorious for having a very low sense of obligation to other people and doing whatever they want to do instead. 

Also, not all people who are self-serving or uninterested in others are psychopaths. Just because someone doesn't throw their heart at your feet and proclaim their undying loyalty to you, doesn't mean they're Hannibal Lecter."
3054,I,N,T,P,"I'm not an advocate for 20th century Communism, I just mentioned Marx and Engels because Marx was an INTJ and Engels was an INTP and the two of them wrote theories and manifestos that would change the 20th century more than almost any other event. They were a good example of the dynamic between those two types. If you contrast that with the relationship between Lenin and Stalin, where Lenin was an INTJ and Stalin was an ENTJ, one ended up overpowering the other. Hitler was an example of how some INFJs mix their ideological motives with their own feeling of anger and bitterness, or how they can turn the bitterness of an entire population into an ideological tool. Mao Zedong was an example of an ENTP dismantling and reshaping power hierarchies and manipulating information and narratives to influence the public. 

Generally, ENTJs and ENTPs, ENTJs and INTPs, and INTJs and ENTPs, can have similar dynamics to the INTJ and INTP. But because ENTPs lead with Ne and ENTJs lead with Te, their dynamics with INTx types are slightly different. ENTPs sacrifice some of their Ti analysis for Ne speculation and ENTJs sacrifice some of their Ni insight for Te organization and execution. But this can be just as effective, especially if one member generates ideas and the other member implements those ideas in an effective way. I was just focussing on INTJs and INTPs because that's what the meme was about."
3055,I,N,T,P,"ENTPs have their own charm. As long as they aren't trying to intentionally destroy things or cause chaos out of boredom, they have a lot of endearing qualities and are fun to be around."
3056,I,N,T,P,"Other types are always picking on INTPs for their awkwardness, hopeless nihilism, social incompetence, and general laziness, while glorifying INTJs for their coldness, precise planning, and decisive action. But we don't mind, because we know INTJs are nicer to INTPs in person than they are to most other types. And INTJs tend to like INTPs more than most other types. As lazy and seemingly incompetent as INTPs are, INTJs are the one type that values the abilities we do have more than any other type.

There's a reason that INTPs are one of the only types that is not intimidated by INTJs in person. Because, while INTJs often disregard most other types for being incompetent or useless, even the most arrogant INTJ will see the value in a peer who is an INTP. In the case of these two types, the INTP is often one of the few people the INTJ can tolerate, and the INTJ is one of the few people the INTP respects. INTJs are the best-suited type to mastermind intricate plans and strategies, and INTPs are the best-suited type to develop or incorporate new theories, ideas, and concepts into already existing frameworks. INTJs may be no-nonsense and efficient, but they are by their nature a cerebral type and recognize the value in theories and concepts. Ni-Te strategies need Ti-Ne insights to account for all potential possibilities and outcomes. An INTJ needs a constantly adapting analysis of ideas and concepts and a constant source of relevant knowledge and insights to help them carry out their plans, which the INTP provides, and an INTP needs a perfect thought-out foolproof strategic system of plans and actions to see their ideas come to life. They will always need us and we will always need them. One of the most well known INTJ-INTP duos in history was Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who co-authored the most impactful political doctrines of the 20th century."
3057,I,N,T,P,"I've had the same experience. Experts on the subject say that people should avoid seriously typing themselves and trying to figure out their cognitive functions until they are mentally mature or developed. People's personalities develop throughout their lives, but we generally stop maturing psychologically around the age of 25-30. Biologically, adolescent physical and mental development doesn't end until around 24 or 25, and until our brains stop developing and we emerge from our adolescence we don't have fully formed or stable identities. For most people, the ages of 15-25 are the time when we try to figure out who we are and discover our own personal identity. The worst time to discover MBTI is probably middle school, or anywhere between the ages of 11-14, because this is generally when people go through puberty and the drastic changes that they experience are enough of an identity crisis on their own, plus during that age, most people are not really looking to find their own identity or understand themselves better they are just trying to cope with their changing minds and bodies and the process of leaving their childhood behind. After the age of 15 it is generally safer to start forming your own identity and discovering your personality, because most people are better adjusted at that age, however, they are still in the process of forming an identity, so MBTI should be used with wisdom and caution. After the age of 25 or by your mid-20s, most people are stable enough to start accurately and honestly looking at their own personality. So MBTI was really intended for more mature people.

I discovered MBTI in high school when I was 16. I was skeptical at first, but the more I got into it the more I realized how eerily my test results mirrored my own traits and tendencies. So I became super confused and got anxiety over the whole thing. I interpreted the test in a way that it was not intended to be interpreted, I started questioning how nuanced my personality really was, and if I could really be put into one of 16 neat categories. Now I understand that MBTI is just a rough tool for approximating certain behavioral and psychological patterns that influence our personality. But I still sometimes feel uneasy or insecure about my personality type. I discovered MBTI 3 or maybe 4 years ago, I'm 19 now and in my first year of college, so I'm definitely not old enough to be considered ""psychologically mature"". I don't think I have grown or changed much in the last 3 years and I still look like the same teenager that anxiously researched Jungian Psychology on his phone during math class in 10th grade. But I guess I still have 5 or 6 years to go before I'm a fully formed ""person,"" so I'd like to think I'm growing and becoming more mature slowly and gradually, and that someday I will be comfortable with myself and not have to constantly question who I am."
3058,I,N,T,P,"That was a very ISTP response. It's often the case that the healthiest and most effective use of MBTI in online MBTI communities comes from sensors. Because of all the frequent mistypes, the romanticization of certain exaggerated character archetypes, and the domination of these communities by self-proclaimed ""intuitives"" particularly INxJs, for a sensor to really utilize MBTI and develop an interest in it, they would have to have an authentic understanding of the true nature of MBTI and its intended purpose. One of the most sensible and insightful people I've met on this sub was an ESFJ, probably the only ESFJ on this subreddit. But she knew more about MBTI than most of the intuitives here, including myself."
3059,I,N,F,J,"Yeah, in the scenarios I'm talking about, my INTJ homies are expressing things they see with clarity that is not first nature for my ENTP homies to see. The ENTPs aren't speaking up in the moment about reasons that cause them to have hesitancy in seeing what the INTJ is expressing. Or the ENTPs say something that they are (in my opinion) wrong about and when the INTJs correct them they shut down - for fear of offending the INTJs, for the ENTPs are viewing the INTJs views as being harmful, and are afraid if they say this (believing they are right) it will cause the INTJs emotional turmoil. when from my perspective the INTJs views are not harmful, the ENTPs are just misunderstanding them, because they're making the decision not to engage to reach an understanding. This is to say that their communication styles being the same isn't the issue, it's the fact that the ENTPs aren't sticking to their guns because, well idk bc I'm not inside their heads, but I think because of tertiary Fe anxiety. Ie I agree with you that if the ENTPs would just interact with the INTJs in question, as opposed to shutting down, it would be quickly resolved between them. However, I have not been able to convince my ENTP friends of this, which is why I made this post. Hope that helps to clarify."
3060,I,N,F,J,"Awesome, will do!"
3061,I,N,F,J,"Hahaha, ty for the response! I will reply/invite u to chat later tonight!"
3062,I,N,F,J,"I'm not talking about one scenario or one group of ENTPs against one intj. Also, usually one thing isn't the only cause of an issue, it's likely a handful of things. In the cases I'm talking about, that I haven't gone into detail on here in public and tbh won't, I do think mbti is a factor."
3063,I,N,F,J,Hell yeah!! Imma message u now! AFAB = Assigned Female at Birth !
3064,I,N,F,J,"Hey thank you, I'll move it to there!"
3065,I,N,F,J,"Awesome ty for the reply! I'm cooking so lemme get back to you in more detail in a second, but I made a discord recently for my ENTP friend! So yes!!! That sounds awesome! And I have a PS4!"
3066,I,N,F,J,"Lmfao it's not satire tho this might be the wrong subreddit for it. If I didn't have limited spoons I would ask, ""what did you think about it was satire?"" but tbh I'm not up for public internet discussions rn ie pls respect my introversion ty. I don't feel like reaching an understanding on/abt my post with anyone confused. I know that's counterproductive but it is what it is re: spoon usage. I hope you have a good day!"
3067,I,N,F,J,"I think that you could reference instances that really call for it, and tell them that you would like them to credit you for showing them things. Like ""my friend x showed me blah"". That you feel your interests are an extension of yourself and it's making you feel like idk. Like when someone steals a joke vs when someone shares a joke someone else made. If anyone has clearer/more precise language to express what I'm saying, chime in below me maybe?"
3068,I,N,F,J,"Yeah. I reacted with humor, because what else could I do in that moment. But it's seriously messed up!"
3069,I,N,F,J,"Also, fat and beautiful aren't exclusive from each other."
3070,I,N,F,J,"Idk if this has been commented (likely has with 100+ comments) but infj, the coined 'thinkingest feeler', came here to say that fat is natural and the question that matters is, is your weight effecting your health? That can go in either direction (not enough fat and/or muscle, or too much fat). Be kind to yourself. Sometimes life makes it hard to be your healthiest. Try to work out and eat healthy when you can."
3071,I,N,F,J,"Also, thank you for the song rec! I agree with you!"
3072,I,N,F,J,I just joined reddit and idk how to link to other subreddits but there is an INFJmusic subreddit!
3073,I,N,F,J,Gotcha!
3074,I,N,F,J,Have you looked into ISFP? ISFPs are often expressive performers. They can be mistaken for extroverts easily.
3075,I,N,F,J,"Because we share the same functions but order flipped, I tend to recognize ESTPs fairly quickly irl. This is due to shared interests: niche/expansive music collection, interest in niche genres of film/books. Etc.
I have a lot of close XSFP friends. My ISFP friends are those more into kawaii aesthetics (if not goth aesthetic, or a mix of both). Both xSFPs like cooking more than ESTPs."
3076,I,N,F,J,Here for it!
3077,I,N,F,J,Thanks!!
3078,I,N,F,J,LMAO
3079,I,N,F,J,Also i feel it will stay a good party game for adults!
3080,I,N,F,J,"Fingers crossed on my end for a competition mode, hahahaha. More realistic fingers crossed for individual party forming (like solely for a person and those they invite to join them in the games)."
3081,I,N,F,J,"Adding myself into the picture: INFJ who is both there for the adventure, and 100% under the estp's and infp's influence. Lol. My two best friends in highschool were actually estp and infp so yeah this is 100% anecdotal. Time to camp out at an unfinished construction lot, in between sand dunes, till the sunrise."
3082,I,N,F,J,"I was typing that in between Fall Guys rounds so I didn't have the time to figure out how to word it in direct response to what you said, but my intention was to ""yes, and"" your post. Haha"
3083,I,N,F,J,Well u didn't say that but I felt it 🤣
3084,I,N,F,J,"The INFJ one is real. K project for instance. The green king had the more ethical viewpoint: That everyone should be granted power so that everyone would have a fighting chance (at defending and protecting themselves from others). If everyone had power, people would think twice before bullying someone else. Or maybe this was the grey kings viewpoint in supporting the green king and the green king just liked games, I really don't remember, because it's been two years since I saw this anime. Either way the world would have been left better had he won/had shiro and his exhausting trope sidekicks lost. The playing field (like, social, economic, etc) would likely be instantly leveled in the world.
Such a soothing anime to watch, in terms of pacing and visuals. I'm not sure if it's an INFJ thing or not, but I love calming animes- Kino's journey being another. Princess mononoke and Nausicaa Valley of the Wind being my two fave Miyazaki films; meanwhile I've heard people say those were too slow for them.

I also like some slice of life animes, my fave being Nana. This falls in with how you said we like animes with well written characters, acting/making decisions that are consistent to their personalities/values."
3085,I,N,F,J,Could I pls have the meme format?

3088,I,N,F,J,Bro. It's the weekend and I'm spending time w my significant other rn. Your comment bombing is overwhelming. I know I haven't responded to your message. Pls b more chill.
3089,I,N,F,J,😊 yw!!
3090,I,N,F,J,♥️
3091,I,N,F,J,Not sure what you're responding to/there is a deleted post above u. Lol
3092,I,N,F,J,Tbh I've actually super enjoyed this conversation too and was hoping you didn't feel differently 🤣 good to know! Thanks for the chat!
3093,I,N,F,J,Hell yeah I'm listening
3094,I,N,F,J,"Definitely a valid question. I will answer this later tho. Haha this one and the one about self help books are probably the two comments I feel the most feels on but I'm putting off explaining, bc finding the best words for things I feel are truly important to understanding me takes time. I'm thankful you asked this and I will answer it but possibly in some days, I'm about to enjoy my weekend tbh :)"
3095,I,N,F,J,"Thank you for this response/perspective! I love hearing INTJs talk about themselves haha bc rly, y'all are so interesting!"
3096,I,N,F,J,*Or at least give us the time and space to do that ourselves- express our true meaning ie complete picture thoughts and feelings- like INTJs who don't see behind our words but will call out the inconsistencies in a way that is much more patient and understanding imo than like . Some ISTPs tbh
3097,I,N,F,J,"Also, concerning your first paragraph, It's not characteristic for us to not form our own perspectives. I would check to make sure they feel comfortable and safe in the environment that the topics are being discussed, as when anxiety kicks in and we would like to leave a conversation we can just say shit to end it whether it's expressed well or not cuz we outchea trying to not have panic attacks. When I was younger I hated discussing things over text/the internet bc it's so hard to express myself with precision and I will say that ISTPs especially or just STs? Look at everything so literally. Y'all don't see anything not presented to you, as aforementioned in the meme concerning ISTJs. In person that's way less of an issue because there's body language, tone, we can see precisely what we've said that's confusing to you or inconsistent and hear it out loud in order to clarify. 
And I know, you're like "" well why can't you just be clear"" and it's because that's hard for us. People have different skills sets lmao. So yeah, we try our best at that, but people who look behind what we're saying to pinpoint the meaning we may not be able to express as easily usually... Stress us out less. Or at least give us the time and space to do that (like INTJs for instance). Yeah. Haha. Feel ISTPs want us to have every answer on the spot and that's stressful for young INFJs. Older ones, like me (well I'm not old I'm yet again in twenties but) are less affected by this because we're more secure in ourselves. Like we don't care at the end of the day what people we have tried our best to communicate with think of us if they are wrong. But young INFJs care a lot about this. We care about being misunderstood, probably because it's so hard for us to express ourselves with precision."
3098,I,N,F,J,"2/4 ISTPs are trans. One desiring physical androgyny (the one I dated) and the other agender (the AFAB one). Both were bi.

Asking them to consider all conversations private unless otherwise specified is a good solution to that, but I'm not sure if ISTPs would respect it if they felt like something should be said, ie if they don't fully understand how important that processing time for INFJs is (over what ISTPs might percieve as a quick and painless fix when it realistically can't yet be that). It's definitely worth a shot though if I'm put in that situation again (none of the ISTPs aforementioned live in my area anymore)."
3099,I,N,F,J,"yeah I think it's a degradation kink. Also, not shaming anyone with a foot fetish. Just the majority of ISTPs I've been close to having this specific kink felt deserving of a mention haha"
3100,I,N,F,J,"So I actually only have INTJ women in my life currently, although I can think of some men I believe were probably INTJ from my high school years.

INTJs have suitors lined up the whole block. Fr.

Relationship advice from this INFJ:
1. Stop beating yourself up about social faux pas. It's okay! We all make mistakes! Cool people will give you a chance to explain some action you did (like forgetting to say hello with resting bitch face on haha bc you're tired), if they even thought anything of it in the first place (infj/entp are likely not to have even thought anything of it for instance. I'm sure some other types too I just can't think of off top). INTJs get so in their heads re: social interaction... Most people (of all types) want to see others for who they are. Keep that in mind and I think you will form the closer connections that you want to, faster!

2. Y'all look away/avoid eye contact so much in my experience. How someone gonna lean in to kiss u. Hahahaha. (Also, this coming from an INFJ who literally has run away from half their first kisses with new partners because of how overwhelming that experience can be).
Oh God but when y'all smile from us directly flirting w u it's the best thing ever. In the case I experience most hahaha, when we know you're not into us but you're still flattered/enjoying/amused by it - I'm bi and flirt w my straight female intj close friend all the time lmao. Even if she wasn't straight tho, I wouldn't act on that re: I'm in a monogamous relationship, so she knows I'm not seriously trying to start a romantic/sexual relationship with her, so that might explain her more comfortable response than like .. if some person was genuinely continueing to pursue her after she obv stated she wasn't interested, etc. 

INTJs are so chill! Like forreal. This made me think about how I wrote that ISTJs see everything they're presented with 100% clearly. Like they never over or under react. I feel that maybe INTJs may over or under react a little bit more than ISTJs, but for the most part I think that applies to y'all too!

Anyway, just give some time to the consideration that someone you would be interested in may be interested in you as well, and are waiting for a sign from you that you would be comfortable with them approaching u... Etc. INTPs/ INFPs have that problem too, whewww they are not direct with their crushes at all. Idk abt INTPs and INTJs but I know with INFPs they highly underestimate who is interested in them. Like the amount of times I've had to shake my INFP best friend with GIRL YOU CAN GET MOST!!! Lmao."
3101,I,N,F,J,H*ck ya! Thanks!
3102,I,N,F,J,Nope not adorable or amusing. The word I'm looking for is endearing. Case in point re: how long it takes us to express ourselves with precision.
3103,I,N,F,J,"One more thing, people who think feet are gross are more likely to develop a foot fetish. Hahaha. The infp way is that they're just another part of the body!"
3104,I,N,F,J,Maybe adorable is the better word re: watching ISTPs not engage in white lies. Y'all are like ENTPs in which you also really don't want to hurt people's feelings. You just want to help!
3105,I,N,F,J,"Thanks for the response! I actually knew a lot of that, but didn't know how to word (one can usually be expected to express themselves better than someone else). Re: the secret aspect. I actually think the way that you ISTPs interact with information is helpful in that it creates a more open atmosphere, making it easier for people of all types to understand each other (through seeing what the other's experience has been). In my younger years however, it was frustrating for me when a close ISTP friend did this, because I wasn't always ready to talk about something with someone. INFJs aren't as in tune with ourselves as some other types (at least, speaking on behalf of myself), so it takes us a longer time than some others to have formulated in our heads what we feel and think about our experiences/those we are interacting with. Especially with enough precision to not make a situation more confusing. 
And one could say ' don't talk about it with someone else till you reach that point' but often we talk with others in order to reach clarity- it helps to have a sounding board. So basically the scenario was often me ---> confiding in my istp friend things in order to help myself figure out what I feel and think so as to not make a situation worse --> istp blurting shit out and making that person mad at me because I hadn't brought it up yet, meanwhile I'm still in the processing phase and have no idea how to express myself clearly (because I don't even know what I feel or think about it yet) to this person in question.
But yeah, I actually did learn what you said about someone telling you something is a secret and y'all respecting it as such. The problem is, more complex issues can't be easily like, list gone thru in terms of what is a secret and what isn't. NGL I ended up just not telling that ISTP anything by the end of high school even tho I still considered them a close friend of mine. I know they never had Ill intent! And kept in mind the pros of their interaction method aforementioned.

Also not engaging in white lies is a good thing in my opinion for the reasons you stated, it's just amusing to watch ISTPs do it 😂 

But yeah I have had 4 close ISTPs in my life and ngl I wrote this more with the 3 AMAB (assigned Male at birth) in mind, the AFAB one was honestly a bit different and I'm waiting for AFAB ISTP to comment about how I didn't mention embroidery or baking haha.

Oh I also dated an ISTP and the what is a secret/privacy thing we're discussing right now was like. Very confusing and I think a little frustrating for them.  I was adaptive to it, idk what an actual solution would be tho! Because it's really just two different natures. Not like you can tell an INFJ to understand themselves faster (maybe in our much older age after studying ourselves throughout our lives), or tell an ISTP to just completely drop and change yalls framework of communication, which does have numerous pros."

3160,I,N,F,J,^^^^^^ I was hunting for a comment like this
3161,I,N,F,J,"I’m also type 2 too lolol and I agree. As someone who was bullied for years and actually did grow up in an abusive family (which I didn’t fully realize until I saw a psychologist), the eagerness to doorslam any time there is sign of conflict without at least trying to address it first or to label everyone as a narcissist/abusive/toxic person and then call for frickin witch hunts against them is honestly appalling to me. 

I have a mom with NPD who I still love and care for very much—just best from afar, and I know I have to put up various defenses when I’m around her. Of course, it took me a long time to get to this point where I can be around her and love her in a healthy way that doesn’t forsake my own sanity and needs. I know that for many people, this isn’t a plausible reality due to their situation. But I feel like most people on those narcissistic parents subs make out narcissists as the devil incarnate or something. But they are still just (very hurt) people. Same goes for bullies. Obviously it depends on the situation, but at least some of the time, it is possible to forgive, understand, and maybe even reconcile. Even if you can’t or don’t want to, which is perfectly understandable and fine... just don’t kid yourself and make it sound like you have no options. Everything is a choice. That kind of situation should be what you strive for instead of being proud of yourself for hating and making gross caricatures out of people.

Venting is fine and finding comfort in people who’ve experienced similar things as you is fine, too. They are probably really necessary for people who are really struggling with these issues. But everything in moderation. Too much of that kind of environment and you will regress and feel even worse"
3162,I,N,F,J,Same and I’m a 2w1 LOL
3163,I,N,F,J,"I’m surprised at all the comments. I miss people very much, even if I didn’t know them super well. If I’ve ever cared for someone, I will miss them. Unless we fell out badly or they ended up not being good friends or something."
3164,I,N,F,J,"Lol same. I think this is why the only person I consider my real friend at this time is an ENFP. We are both major losers who can’t fit in, even though we try super hard and most people would even see us as the opposite from the outside. But we know we are. And it’s soso lonely. That’s why we understand each other"

3170,I,N,F,J,Fishing is the worst
3171,I,N,F,J,"I mean, sure, but if you can’t handle the truth you shouldn’t be asking those kinds of questions to begin with"
3172,I,N,F,J,"Well I mean I don’t really understand it either cause I’m not like that at all lol which is why I said it was bizarre. It’s just something I’ve observed over time. 

I think it comes down to values. Some people just don’t value honesty as much and put a greater emphasis on what’s “proper”/etiquette/social norms. Of course, it could also be that they’re insecure. But I don’t think that’s the only reason"
3173,I,N,F,J,"But for some bizarre reason, a lot of people would actually prefer to be lied to"
3174,I,N,F,J,"Agreed, it’s completely unreasonable to expect people to want to know and care for you if you don’t show them who you really are. Had to learn that the hard way"
3175,I,N,F,J,"My experience might not be so helpful to you as I work in a startup/small business environment, but I think it really does come down to practice and challenging yourself to grow in these areas. For me, I’m able to start being comfortable in any given environment once I’ve gotten comfortable/close-ish with at least one person there. And this level of comfort grows the more I bond with people in the environment until I’m able to completely be myself and go up to completely random people/strangers. 

I also tend to have a social mode and work mode, which I guess is how I control my behavior. When people are fooling around and the atmosphere is lighthearted, I engage in my social mode and become really extroverted (if I feel like it). And when I and/or everyone is busy and working or just not in the mood to socialize, I block out everything, focus, and am just like how I am when I’m alone. 

As for the awkwardness and making a fool out of yourself, LOL. I honestly have just accepted this part of me and managed to turn it into humor/comedic effect. It gets people to laugh with me, and I like making people happy and comfortable, and I enjoy laughing at myself as well. It really does make everyone much more comfortable at work and especially around you."
3176,I,N,F,J,"Yeah I am completely aware that it’s all on my side and that it’s just feelings. I don’t actually think I know anything about that person if they’re new to me. It’s just that I have a strong feeling that if we became friends or whatever it would be so great and that makes me really interested in getting to know them better and understanding them. It is just a feeling, and I know it doesn’t make much sense, but in all past situations, the relationship did end up happening and being great. So that’s why I tend to put more trust in it, if that makes sense. But the thing is, and I don’t think some people got it from my original post (maybe I didn’t explain well), I’m pursuing “getting to know that person”, NOT an immediate committed relationship. It doesn’t make any sense to expect the latter out of a stranger. Idk bru, if I like someone, I’m just really interested in them and I want to know everything about them, how/what they think and feel. I have lowkey trust issues so I wouldn’t just blindly trust anyone. That’s why I pursue getting to know them to see if they will be trustworthy first. 

I do know what you’re saying with the illusion thing though, as I have some tendency to do this, but it hasn’t been very disruptive except for when it comes to romantic relationships. I’m usually very good at suspending judgment and not holding onto assumptions until I know all (or as much as possible) of the facts.

If someone just absolutely isn’t interested in me at all, I would not care to pursue anything with them, either. I’m usually interested if they are also interested on some level. I respect myself and don’t want to waste my time/energy, so if I get that impression, I definitely back off and give the person space. It’s just that eventually, they have always come back and reciprocated and the relationship has turned out great. 

I don’t do this to just anyone, it’s super rare for me to feel that level of interest and understanding in someone. That’s why when it feels like the potential for something so special, I want to actually see where it goes. I personally absolutely can’t stand clingy and needy people either LOL so. I may be disproportionately worried that I might come off that way. But I’ve never been described as that, usually the opposite. Most people also say that I’m very charismatic so I also think that’s interesting that you brought that up. I don’t know, man. I was just going about my day when something (I don’t remember what) just triggered this thought, and I can’t stop thinking about it. 

Anyway, thanks for the perspective, and sorry for the word vomit!!"
3177,I,N,F,J,"Yeah I’m also pretty firm with not jumping to conclusions or assuming things I don’t know about a person. I guess for me it’s more like a feeling of “wow that person’s *interesting* I want to get to know them so much more!!” with the feeling that we would be compatible.

What I’ve found is that people can tend to be a little hesitant, but once they hang out with me properly once, they really like me too and then gradually the interest is reciprocated. But I had the strong feeling from the beginning that this would happen, so it just feels very slow to me.

Also, I’m definitely not just constantly going after people 😂😂😂. Not sure if it came off that way. But I back off completely if I feel like it’s not being reciprocated and can definitely become indifferent. It depends on how much I’m invested, if I see a future with that person, how they’re responding, etc. I will not waste my time or energy on people who don’t care about me, either. Eventually, though, they’ve always come around (at least so far) and we have great relationships."
3178,I,N,F,J,"I think you already got pretty good advice but here are my two cents! If he told you explicitly that he had a crush on you, then that’s a very good sign. At least for me, I wouldn’t just say that unless I genuinely felt a bond with someone and really liked them. And if I genuinely like someone, I usually like them for a long time / am not quick to get over them.

He might just be terrible at initiating honestly, and have a fear of reaching out that way. I know people who are like this who are completely fine when engaging in person. I used to be terrible at initiating too, and I had to learn to be the initiator out of necessity (because I didn’t have any friends or anything). It took a long time to get used to it, and it’s still somewhat terrifying to do depending on the person or situation. ESPECIALLY my crush. But yeah I completely feel you about trying to leave the ball in the other person’s court and not trying to overwhelm him and stuff 😭😭. I’m in a similar situation with my shy ENTP crush and chauwjuaksnsjna.

So yeah, like the other person said, I think you should just ask. It seems like you guys are at a close enough level to do that relatively safely. I hope it turns out well!!!"
3179,I,N,F,J,"Hello again, I’m really not trying to pick a fight here, but I saw the edit to your previous comment and I had to respond. 

I do *not* want to skip the “getting to know each other” part. I firmly believe that you don’t really ever know a person, so I wouldn’t rush headlong into a commitment or trust someone without having a better idea of what that person is like. When I “pursue” someone, what I’m doing is trying to get to know and understand them better. Because I don’t think I can logically say that I genuinely like someone without knowing them. 

I also don’t believe you can “convince” someone to be with you. A person either likes you or they don’t. Sure, there are certain things you can do to appeal to them more, but even if it gets to the point where they’re in a relationship with you, those tricks will all fall away. What’s left is what you feel for that person and what they feel about you, and whether the both of you are willing to commit to each other."
3180,I,N,F,J,"I see. I personally think that because I’m already pretty hard to understand according to most people, I kind of have to be direct. That’s a skill that I’ve been working on a lot, because I’m not really that way naturally or at least I wasn’t due to a near lifetime of negative, inhibiting experiences. Also, I’m not trying to “seduce” anyone lol.

I don’t agree with your assumption that being direct = being easy, and I don’t like playing games because I feel they are a waste of my time and energy. I respect your opinion and can see where you’re coming from, though. I just would not personally pursue anything with someone who wouldn’t be upfront about their intentions and would play mind games with me. To each his own, I guess."
3181,I,N,F,J,"Yes!! It’s so rare and exciting and that’s why when it does happen I want to protect/pursue it at all costs (within reason, of course). People who I’ve pursued this way don’t believe me when I say I’m usually really not like that at all, it’s only because they’re special to me.

That’s so interesting what you said about Ni-doms being “wanty.” I don’t think I’ve ever heard that or thought of it that way, but I can definitely see it now that you said it."
3182,I,N,F,J,"That’s an interesting perspective! Thanks for sharing. I haven’t watched the video yet, but I will make sure to check it out.

I’m female and I haven’t ever been described as clingy or needy. Usually I’m calm and pretty detached, but when I like someone or think someone is interesting, I show it. 

Honestly, I don’t understand the whole “don’t be open about how you feel/be stoic” idea at all. I think that’s a terrible method of communication and will more often than not backfire. If the person doesn’t like me, then they don’t like me and it’s disappointing, but it’s fine. I won’t compromise who I am for anyone. The thing is, in the situations I described in my post, they always end up liking me and reciprocating the same amount. I also tend to be very well-liked in general, so I’m inclined to think that’s not really a problem in my case.

I do try not to push too hard and always back off if I feel like I’m overdoing it or the person needs space. It ends up being like a dance lolol because I’m always trying to adjust for what the other person is comfortable with. It’s just kinda sad when you really like someone and it seems like they don’t really like you. 

On the other hand, if it really is coming from a place of insecurity and neediness, then yeah, I would agree that it’s a problem and needs to be addressed. But even then, I can’t ever imagine recommending to anyone to not be open about their feelings or to act like they don’t care when they do. 

I guess that is just a difference in our perspectives. May I ask what makes you think that?"
3183,I,N,F,J,"I used to be like you when I was younger. I was literally invisible at school, and even people from my friend group (granted, it was kinda big, but still) didn’t know who I was or that I even existed. Even though I knew every single one of them and always got them presents for their birthday and holidays, etc. 

After years of that as well as bullying later, I am still surprised years later, when people remember me and when they’re nice to me. Which actually happens quite a lot these days, honestly. People are really nice to me now for whatever reason (I think I know most of the reasons, but it’s too much to explain rn). 

But I think it’s not bad to be able to be grateful for those little things. I really am so deeply happy and grateful every single time it happens, even now when it’s almost an everyday occurrence. Although my first reaction is still blank shock and it takes me a bit of time to process what just happened. It surprises many people because they expect me to have always been treated well, but I think they appreciate that much more how I’m able to have humility despite that. I mean obviously low self-esteem is not good. I’ve had to work on it A LOT and I still have a ways to go. But I think it’s not necessarily bad to have experienced that kind of struggle and then overcome it, if that makes sense. It can make you so much stronger."
3184,I,N,F,J,But not the integrated 2s 😎😎
3185,I,N,F,J,Same
3186,I,N,F,J,What I don’t get is that she does have “friends”. She literally went out every day to see them while she was ignoring us and talks to people on the phone all day regularly. I guess the friendships don’t go too deep or she needs even more than what they can offer (or doesn’t know how to ask)
3187,I,N,F,J,"Zero chance. It was an absolute miracle though, my prayers were finally answered. Things do look slightly more hopeful than they used to. I guess we’ll have to just wait and see. I still hope I don’t have to be too close if/when it happens for the sake of my sanity"
3188,I,N,F,J,"I seriously feel for you in your situation. It must be hard in a different way because she’s not even directly related to you. Never stop fighting for yourself though!! You can do it!!

And thank you! That’s honestly a relief to hear. It’s not fun being the bitch of the family, especially when you kinda pride yourself on having empathy and lovingness as your greatest strengths. Maybe it’s more apparent to literally everyone else. But yeah, my older sister and mom also think confrontation = bad, so. I think telling the truth and doing what is best for them is more loving than making them feel better or loved. Although I have emotionally detached myself from family, for better or for worse. I still love them and can understand their perspectives and empathize with them in my head. But I just can’t empathize or feel anything for them in my heart anymore. 

I think it’s a good sign and honestly a miracle that she left my dad in the first place. So we shall see what happens haha"
3189,I,N,F,J,"Yeahhh.

I’m gonna be honest tho, I don’t really get the point of making these kinds of charts trying to match up zodiac signs with MBTI types cause... it doesn’t work like that ahah. Unless it’s just for fun and/or just based on the stereotypes which I guess is fine as long as you keep that in mind"

3193,I,N,F,J,Uhhhh no
3194,I,N,F,J,"Forcing someone to do something they hate will make them hate it (and you) even more. You can’t force a person to change. People only change when they decide they want to and then force themselves to. Maybe you’ll be able to inspire some people to want to change by forcing it. That’s probably the people who are saying they started out anxious about participating but ultimately overcame it because of required participation. That’s great and I’m glad it worked for you, but also please recognize that it won’t work for everyone (probably most people). 

Active participation in class for me was traumatizing. I actively listened way better than most people and I understood concepts really easily. I got good grades and was put in academically gifted programs. But I had crippling social anxiety, hated being wrong especially in front of a bunch of strangers, needed more time to process, and couldn’t explain in speech nearly as well as I could in writing. I already had a pretty bad view of authority figures because of my parents, but the teachers who really forced me to participate in the specific ways they wanted made me really fear teachers specifically and hate institutional education. 

I got over a lot of these issues because I worked on myself. Not because of these experiences, but because *I* wanted to (and different life experiences). I became well-known as extremely outgoing, friendly, direct, and not afraid to challenge people both in social settings and at work. But as soon as I’m put back into a classroom setting, I revert to trying my best to become invisible, running through all possible worst-case scenarios of participating in class, and mentally formulating my answers to a plethora of hypothetical questions if I know there’s even the slightest chance the professor might call on me. My body starts shaking and my heart starts beating painfully hard until the danger passes (the end of class). 

I don’t even feel comfortable approaching most professors individually outside of or before/after class because of my experiences in public school. It works for me fine because I’m very good at learning things on my own, but I do wish that it didn’t have to be like that sometimes. After all, forming relationships with teachers is important, too. I have tried to push myself multiple times, but it is incredibly hard and at this point just easier to figure out things by myself."
3195,I,N,F,J,"It could actually be harder for native speakers to take formal language classes (depending on the difficulty level). If you’re a native speaker, you’re probably not going to be thinking about all the technical parts of learning a language because they just come naturally to you and don’t have to be absolutely correct. And everyday speech is very different from the kind of speech that is typically taught, which is more formal/professional."
3196,I,N,F,J,"Yeah or even assuming that anxiety about participating in the classroom is equivalent to not having social skills or the ability to speak up in other areas of life. There are a LOT of things that are unique to the classroom environment that make my anxiety so much worse there but don’t really affect me in daily life. 

I can socialize fine, I’m generally seen as extremely outgoing and direct in social situations and at work, but put me back in a classroom and you can bet that I’ll try my hardest to become invisible. And if I know that there’s a chance of someone calling on me on the spot, I will spend the whole entire class focusing on formulating hypothetical responses to a number of potential questions. 

I always remember the classroom as being traumatizing."

3199,I,N,F,J,"This is why I used to avoid the news, but I realized that I was being selfish and willfully ignorant, which I decided was a bigger problem with real societal consequences that are much more important than my personal feelings. 

Now, I have a daily subscription to a more balanced/objective newspaper. I let the unread emails kind of pile up in my mailbox app for a bit until I’m in the right emotional state (detached) to read them. It helps that I absolutely hate the red notification numbers on my mailbox, which prevents me from putting it off for too long."
3200,I,N,F,J,"I can understand that if we were talking about moral or serious things, but she does that with “trivial” (for lack of a better word;; sorry, don’t mean to be offensive) issues as well. Like, things that I can’t really imagine would be the same or have the same effect.

For example, she said recently that asians were so much prettier and she wishes she could reach that “level”. I told her that I think you shouldn’t idealize or make those kinds of over-generalizations because they just aren’t true of everybody and it makes no sense to say that a specific race/ethnic group is better/prettier/whatever. 

Also, I know that she’ll just compare herself and make herself feel worse by saying and believing things like that. So I wanted to prevent that and make her feel better. But she got defensive about it and I ended up making her feel worse lol rip"

3242,I,N,T,J,"First of all there are 8 functions, not 16. Each personality type is made of 4 functions and letters(INTJ ESFP etc.) are just a representation of what these functions are. There are 4 types of cognitive functions which are Thinking Feeling Intuition Sensing. Each of these functions also have extraverted and introverted versions of them such as Fe Fi for Feeling. That’s why there are 8 functions in total. So each person has 2 extraverted and 2 introverted functions and is ordered by how intense they are. Also order has to be IEIE or EIEI. What mbti tests essentially do is they offer 2 choices on a scale where one is the extraverted option and the other is the introverted option of the same type. Then it calculates your score for each 8 functions based on where you answer on the scale. For example if you choose the answer between left one and middle it might give +3 Fe +1 Fi points. They also put a few specific questions based on personality types stereotypes. At the end they list your most intense functions and using the specific questions they asked about stereotypes try and guess your personality type. It’s very simple."

3259,I,N,T,P,I don't know how I feel about frozen heart first item. Zeke's is a better gold efficient item that gives you utility.
3260,I,N,T,P,Actually want her for my collection
3261,I,N,T,P,"False, there are players like that at every tier/elo. This includes diamond and up."
3262,I,N,T,P,The name fits.
3263,I,N,T,P,"I was an adc main but switched after season 8 became the zed meta (This was when adcs got atk speed nerfed). Biggest ""mental switch"" was that you're not the ""carry"" anymore, but I was fine with that and didn't care. My adc winrate was a horrid 40 percent, but my support winrate is above 60 percent now, so I guess the switch was fine, but support role hinders mechanics development."
3264,I,N,T,P,"Totally agree
I'm a support main, and if lanes a lost cause, roaming is best option to helping team. Invading with jungler sometimes works, though without prio its difficult. 
Its a waste of time and resources for support to stay bot lane due to lost lane. Snowballing other lanes is your best bet."
3265,I,N,T,P,Def use Hans if you can max him. Decent budget support unit.
3266,I,N,T,P,Athene's is meh for morg support. Personally rush Zhonya's then either go for rylei's for slow cc with w or get liandry's for dmg over time.

3268,I,N,T,P,"If yall don't know this, how herald works is that it does true damage. So if you pop it before you get to half health on a turret with plates, the herald won't kill it, and if you notice the armor and magic resist on the turret, it will have more than 200 armor and mr, making it near impossible to kill it fast enough. This is why people want to get turret health down to about half or lower, even if it means ""overkilling"". 
Herald dmg also depends on the TOTAL AVERAGE LEVEL of all 10 players, so if the avg is higher, it will do a lot more dmg than when the avg lvl is lower. This can allow players to push even harder for turrets."
3269,I,N,T,P,"If you're gonna run glacial blitz, run pta ad blitz instead and build manamune and either tri force or gauntlet. Gives tankiness and another carry potential with hard cc due to items"

Blitz falls off mid and late game, so only thing going for him is ability to get picks and peeling for carries. Glp doesn't let him peel for carries in mid game.

Not as often in higher elos ofc, but ive played against support mains that played exceptionally well, just that unfortunately they don't understand game macro so they're stuck. But yeah ive seen good micro but really, really bad macro skilled players in low silver.

P.S, silver isn't hard to get out of at all. Silver is a mental thing. You probably have the skills to get out, but its just the mentality of how you're playing that holds you and others back, unfortunately. Overcome that issue and guarantee you will climb fast.

EDIT: I climbed out of silver playing solo queue support, and it wasn't all too bad. Gold is much worse imo. Players tend to int more deliberately in Gold than in silver."
3279,I,N,T,P,"Sometimes we supports may want you to save the heal for yourself. Sometimes we know were going to die and its going to be pointless to try to save us, so its better to let us die if we know we're going to die due to personal mistakes during a gank."
3280,I,N,T,P,"Not entirely true. Support may be autoing minions to force lvl 2 all in engage and lvl 6 all in. Especially goes for engage cc supports. Other times support may be trying to set up minion mismatch so that they can try to perform an engage. If you got more minions and enemy champion hits you, your minions retarget onto the enemy champion doing double damage. Its just some slight, underlying things your support is attempting to do, but the adc may not be aware of such a strategy."

3291,I,N,T,P,"Support can be a carry role too lol. If you can call macro plays and shotcall really well, you can turn the tide of the game with macro alone, without fighting for turrets or objectives.

3302,I,N,T,P,Would give you kiara and drake for that roll. I need her for my emiya einzbern family
3303,I,N,T,P,"Zyra is actually really good into Blitz. Her plants make it tough for Blitz to position properly and fire a hook. If he tries to walk up you can just root him and back up. Zyra also scales later in dmg so you'll still be helpful, and Blitz will still have trouble positioning. Just make sure not to screw positioning against him mid and late, otherwise all that positioning early game in lane was for nothing. Nami is not good into Blitz, unless you can perfectly land your bubbles. Otherwise Blitz will have a field day, and his adc can be like 12/0 at 10 minutes. Leona is a skill match up. Leona's w is what makes her tanky early, but if the Blitz knows about her weakness. he can capitalize on it and turn on you once your w goes down."
3304,I,N,T,P,"More like, random wikipedia pages at 3 in the morning."
3305,I,N,T,P,"Meh not really. Sure they might know power spikes, but not specific power spikes for a certain champion.
EDIT: If you don't play support or have not played support, you don't know how the role works."
3306,I,N,T,P,"If you're playing an enchanter, just poke him really hard and play overtly aggressive against him. All you're looking for is to survive the laning phase, since he falls off mid and late game. Playing against blitz requires more aggressive positioning, and making his life hard when he tries to hook. Walk perpendicular him oppossite of him. It'll be obvious if he tries to hook, so you should have enough time to react and side step his hook. His hook cd pre lvl 6 is at least 20 seconds, so you have a 20 second time frame to punish him and potentially kill his adc if they happened to follow up on his call and be out of position."
3307,I,N,T,P,"Also recommend backing off if blitz hits lvl 2 first in lane. Q E combo can guarantee his adc a double kill and you lose lane instantly. 
If you position well, however, you can punish him if he tries to hit lvl 2 first. If he saves his gold quest procs, punish him hard the first and second wave. Chip his health away to discourage from using the procs and engaging even if he gets lvl 2 advantage."
3308,I,N,T,P,"The hook is worse with iblitz, because animation looks faster and the range is bugged. I can literally hook blue buff from bot side river. To play against blitz, play an anti engage cc engage champion like alistar galio or taric. Get hooked on alistar and you jump into their adc. Galio taunt negates his cc. Taric stun is huge and the ult denies all of blitz's quick dmg burst, unless he's smart. Morgana and leona is a skill match up. Do not recommend playing either if you don't understand how either works. 
Watch for blitz walk up too. If i cant get a good position for hook, ill walk up and hit them with my e. If they flash i have a free hook. 
Another way blitz is played is he ults for the .5 second silence reset and then either e or q followed by the other. 
This method works well against ezreal and any champions with an escape."

3340,I,N,T,P,"I am sorry your friend passed away. But obesity is not an eating disorder - binge eating disorder is and though it often leads to obesity, it is different. My point is that obesity does not kill anyone, the cause is always an illness or injury caused by behavior. Basically most people believe that poor life choices lead to obesity and obesity then leads to for example a heart attack. But the truth is that poor life choices lead to a heart attack AND usually also obesity. So some people can be obese and also be healthy and behavior is a much more reliable predictor of health risks as opposed to weight. Assesing mental disorders based on weight is a whole other issue btw. Many people don't get diagnosed because they're not thin or fat enough to be diagnosed and they suffer without any help.

3357,I,N,T,P,nope! read my response to the other comment if you have the time. i know its long but i think i explained it pretty well
3358,I,N,T,P,"they way you describe what you think about fatness and beauty seems to be really a matter of personal taste, which i respect ofc. the eye of the beholder etc. etc. i think we mostly agree here

I think you have a lot of misconceptions about fat and health which does not surprise me, most people have them. Obviously, being diabetic and being fat are again, two different things and describing an illness as a flaw is kind of insensitive? i know the discussion is not about this but its like you're telling someone to improve themselves because they have an illness? 

anyway, the scientific consensus seems to be that everybody has kind of a natural weight they seem to gravitate towards when they eat healthy and exercise. However, for some people, that weight is above of what society considers acceptable. These people tend to fall victim to eating disorders and unhealthy diets in order to lose weight that is natural for them. The issue with striving for thin instead of healthy is that people often disregard their health in order to lose weight which ironically makes them sadder, more tired and can lead to eating disorders. Similarly, people who are naturally thin do not see the need to be healthy and end up damaging their bodies by unhealthy habits but nobody cares because its not apparent on the outside.

Also research shows that illnesses commonly associated with obesity (like diabetes, heat attack) are actually much more correlated with habits than with weight. For instance there can be two people who both eat fried caloric food and dont exercise but have different body fat percentage and then there can be two people with the same body fat % but completely different lifestyles. The first couple has a lot more similar probability of getting a heart attack than the second couple. 

The only instance in which fat is actually a burden is when the weight itself damages the body - as in a person is too heavy for their joints to move without damage. But that only applies to very very obese people.

So in conclusion:

* losing weight does not make a person better
* fat is a terrible predictor of health
* fat is not a burden except for the most extreme cases"

&#x200B;

I was using the slides for our presentation to talk to someone and wrote ""your mom gay"" long story short I forgot to delete it and it was still there the next day when we presented. I had to talk to the teacher and it turned out the other students parents were gay and the teacher was accusing me of ""outing"" the kids parents to the whole class. i talked to the student having she was a friend of mine, she then told me the reason she started crying when we were talking to the teacher was BECAUSE the teachers was making her sad bringing up her past. The student was completely fine with me (even though her moms weren't) and btw I was unaware of the kids situation. the teacher then mad me write an apology letter and almost made me apologize to the whole class (who still didn't know because this was a common joke at the time)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Therefore, the TEACHER violated the students privacy by telling me, and the other kids to this day are STILL not aware of the fact that the kid has two moms, lets just say the teacher got some ""interesting"" emails from my family

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

i am aware I was also at fault but the teacher just made it way worse, oh yeah, and the teacher also hated me for the rest of the year (this happened within the first month and i had her for two classes so you can only imagine how miserable that year was for me)"

3364,E,S,T,P,"My parents blame electronics and not going outside for constantly being upset or ""tired"" but it's them and their ""strictness"", by being as strict as they are, they aren't protecting me from kidnappers or whatever they are just making my life miserable and I'm starting to wonder if i'll ever live the life I've dreamed of. My ""ideal"" life isn't like being rich even, it's just having fun and constantly being with my friends. i have lost so many friends over the years, some which have moved, and some which have just stopped talking to me and i think it's my fault for not being in touch with them ever. I keep seeing things where people are saying that ""Over quarantine i realized that some of my friends are just in school friends"", but like ALL my friends are just in school friends because iI'm not allowed to hang out with them. I've always been labeled as quite childish as well, and i always just thought I don't think I'm ever gonna grow out of this, :)"" but I don't think it's because of my personality anymore, i thinks it's because i feel the need to make up for the childhood i never got to ""live"" because my parents want me to be safe."
3365,E,S,T,P,"I currently have somewhat long hair but i feel if I am to get an undercut i might cut my hair a couple inches shorter but idk, for now, its just a thought"

3371,E,S,T,P,The fact that i actually say the last one even tho im female

3381,E,S,T,P,mind reading
3382,E,S,T,P,"For the most part, my friends haven't taken the test so it is possible that I have met one, but i highly doubt it. It's like I'm foreign to them, they act like they've never met someone that acts like me and they very well might not have."

3389,E,S,T,P,"the majority of my friends are actually introverted but I have a few extroverted friends. For the most part though they seem to be EN's so idk. But after this whole pandemic thing I really only have one friend and as unbelievable she's a really sensitive introvert. (It's kinda odd that we get along) All my other friends were also guys, I tend to get along with guys best because of my personality I believe."
3390,E,S,T,P,The oc sad something about ESTPs being self absorbed and arrogant or sum
3391,E,S,T,P,I guess you're right.
3392,E,S,T,P,never *fucking* again.
3393,E,S,T,P,My biggest fear is that my family will force me to focus so much on my future that'll I'll lose myself in the present. I'm scared that i won't have time for my friends or anything fun really in the future.

3409,I,N,F,J,I hate the “savior complex” being a INFJ is not fun or special...... 😑.
3410,I,N,F,J,I member for sure
3411,I,N,F,J,It’s interesting that you say that INFJ’s have big egos🤔 are they male or female  ? In my opinion I don’t think I have a big ego.... I just find it rude to show it off if I had any But I have heard that some do you have big egos which I do find frightening.
3412,I,N,F,J,That meeeee!
3413,I,N,F,J,Fr! Darn thoses charming ENTJ’s ☺️
3414,I,N,F,J,You sound like me when I talking about theses problems because we have the same problem. The reasons you put are exactly why I don’t tell people much of what I like personally.
3415,I,N,F,J,I actually really like not getting notifications/texts from people it’s draining... at the same time I wish someone text me first 😅.
3416,I,N,F,J,😳..... damn it you got me😅guess you guys do what you want 🤣.
3417,I,N,F,J,You can control me 😖!
3418,I,N,F,J,Interesting 🤔
3419,I,N,F,J,I agree with this! As a infj female I would like to know if I have a problem (especially if I am hurting you) of course I may be upset for a bit but I always end up seeing their side and apologize.
3420,I,N,F,J,"Being understood,having ALOT of alone time,hanging around the right people who care about me,cats and helping others feel good."
3421,I,N,F,J,"1.kinda...it gives me something to look at like a cheat sheet but at the same time we are all different so I keep a open mind.


2.I try to keep a open mind so I guess not


3.Nope! I think my past relationships were Istp and Esfp."
3422,I,N,F,J,Wow not many INFJ’s I see.
3423,I,N,F,J,Interesting 🤔don’t mind me.
3424,I,N,F,J,THANK YOU! I’ve always felt mature for my age .I’ve always been told by classmates in the same grade as me also but the downside is that people think you’re no fun😢
3425,I,N,F,J,Lmao 🤣
3426,I,N,F,J,Honestly tho 😂lol Couldn’t have been more correct
3427,I,N,F,J,It’s definitely an introvert problem 😅 it happens in text too when you’re in a group chat.
3428,I,N,F,J,I hate when it does that 🤣
3429,I,N,F,J,I’ve met a infp they are so sweet and cute <3 love y’all too.
3430,I,N,F,J,🥺
3431,I,N,F,J,You can message me when you want someone to talk to.😊
3432,I,N,F,J,Yeah I do 😢 I daydream a lot about this sort of thing. I would like to get into a relationship but you don’t want to rush it especially in high school 😅I’m hopping in college I’ll find somebody.
3433,I,N,F,J,Forget about why the chicken exists think about all the facts about the chickens  and different types of chickens.There is so much you can learn about chickens 😊
3434,I,N,F,J,Lol
3435,I,N,F,J, If only there was way we could feel this satisfaction.
3436,I,N,F,J,Lol that’s cute
3437,I,N,F,J,Lmao the love the name Juan 🤣
3438,I,N,F,J,I know one of my friends don’t like to be touched  when they are upset... it scared me and first when she said “ Don’t Touch Me!”.The way she said it and the tone made me cry but I need to understand that other people have different ways of handing “am fine” situations.
3439,I,N,F,J,No one I know can understand me well 😖
3440,I,N,F,J,I have terrible grammar 😑
3441,I,N,F,J,Y
3442,I,N,F,J,Lol I feel like I tell my friends that all the time 🤣
3443,I,N,F,J,Lmao yeah 😅
3444,I,N,F,J,Yes 🤣
3445,I,N,F,J,That’s to evil.....
3446,I,N,F,J,AWWWW
3447,I,N,F,J,I HATE IT.
3448,I,N,F,J,Honestly tho I hate it! I was just talking to my mom about how I want to connect with my person and have commitment and spend some quality time with my partner not just hook up and leave🙄
3449,I,N,F,J,You don’t want to be a infj 😅if you want to know more you are free to dm me
3450,I,N,F,J,Same they are so interesting 🤔
3451,I,N,F,J,I am weird😂 sometimes when I vent I ask for your opinions and solutions.
3452,I,N,F,J,Being off beat normally makes me feel bad(I’m also in band) but seeing this gives me anxiety.
3453,I,N,F,J,A few times 🤔
3454,I,N,F,J,Yeahhh..... i’ll become more flirty if it’s somebody I like but yeah once in a while I catch myself acting a little flirty around my friends. I think my biggest line is probably “sh—shut up 🤣” then I push them a little. Bad thing is I don’t want anyone thinking that I like them.
3455,I,N,F,J,Can relate😢I am good friends with one of my friends in high school when one day this new girl showed up and she clicked with her so quick like three weeks quick! We went on a out of state field trip and when it came to a three person group she chose her instead of me same with other people who click with her or thought she was cool (like I known you guys longer and you are fighting over the new girl) low-key kind of made me feel bad and I know this one dude was joking but it’s still kind of hurt when he said (because my first name was her last name) said she was the better(my first name).she was pretty smart she only stayed for a year and a half before going to early college and when she left most things went back to normal.
3456,I,N,F,J,Lol 🤣nah you good I was probably the weird one.
3457,I,N,F,J,Lol
3458,I,N,F,J,Honestly this is mine as well 😅

Very limited in understanding). Don't get me wrong though btw. A lot of Thanos maps equally to both ISTJ'S and INTJ'S as both are half identical (both have high Te). It's just that the other half very evidently makes him INTJ rather than ISTJ. He is very evidently way too much of a dreamer, an intuitive to be ISTJ. You only see him now taking action after he's already thought out and planned out 100's of steps ahead. ISTJ's plan too but it's more so one step at a time."
3561,I,N,T,J,"I'm fairly certain that El Chapo's ISTJ.

The Terminator is hands down ISTJ

Edit: Actually, honestly I think most serial killer villains fall very inline with the ISTJ personality."
3562,I,N,T,J,Thanos is the epitome of Ni Dom Te. Some of what you just described is applicable to high Te in general
3563,I,N,T,J,What about him makes him more ISTJ than INTJ?
3564,I,N,T,J,"There is a correlation between environment and cognitive functions but not to the extent that they change your type. 

What usually happens instead is you often have feelers mistyping as thinkers because the environment they grew up in forced them to use more of their thinking functions to get by. This doesn't mean that it changes your type though. Just more developed or more used lower functions. Which will lead to a person inexperienced in Typology thinking they changed types or are a type they are not. I've noticed a huge correlation with feelers and going through trauma mistyping as thinkers."
3565,I,N,T,J,"
>I thought he had more Fi compared to the ESTJs I know because he treats others how he wants to be treated (he doesn’t micromanage people while an unhealthy ESTJ often does),

Lol. Are you INFJ by chance? This is where you're mistaken. ESTJ's also treat others how they wish to be treated. It's just that the micromanaging and what not is also how they wish to be treated. 

Cries when gf cries eh. I mean I guess that's a solid point for more Fi. 

Being stuck in viewpoint of beleif doesn't have to be Fi. Could be Te or Ni or Si or honestly almost any function based on who's interpreting as ""being stuck in viewpoint or beleif"". 

The opportunist, confident so going to interviews unprepared, impatient so taking shortcuts and arguing with teacher for trying to control him are all very Se-Ni things. Very. In the contrary, you never really presented and Si things about him here. 

I asked if you were INFJ in the beginning cuz I've notice that you guys often have a hard time understanding that one function can lead to such drastic differences between you two (xNTJ vs xNFJ) so you guys tend to blow xNTJ's off as being xSTJ's."
3566,I,N,T,J,"Lol. I see why Ti's hate Te users now. They think us high Te users, use it how you inferior Te's use it here: Poorly. *""Even though this logic suggests 2+2 = 4, I think it's 7 anyway""* 😆

Jokes aside, I ironically understand exactly what you're saying. I've notice the same thing amongst ENTJ/Se vs ESTJ/Si. Think it has more to do with Se being more flexible while Si being inflexible/hardlined/dutiful/disciplined. Though I'm not trying to say I entirely agree with your reasoning though. But nevertheless I do understand completely.  Also do agree on concluding ENTJ for one of the same reasons (shortcuts and impatience)

I swear you Fi doms with your Te understand Typology better than most these au-Ti-stic Ti's. That is of course when you're not mistyping yourselves as thinking types through egotism. But makes since as Briggs was INFP herself."
3567,I,N,T,J,"Some of it sounds more ENTJ leaning than ESTJ but either way, ISTJ/ESTJ doesn't matter. Like at all. There is little to nothing considerable that one gets from differentiating on the E/I axis. It's ridiculously odd how people try to stress ""oh is he ISTJ or ESTJ"". It literally makes like no difference. 

That being said, he sounds rather much more on the Te dominant axis rather than auxillary. Based on your description, seems he favors that function more. And yeah, also again, he does kinda sound a little more on the ENTJ side. 

Oh, also, what was the ""notice more Fi than I typically see for an ESTJ"" mean? What makes you think that? And I'm assuming you know other ESTJ's as well. In what ways are you suggesting they lack in Fi in comparison to your brother?"
3568,I,N,T,J,How'd that happen
3569,I,N,T,J,"Hardly anything you learn in a CS degree will be of little to no use. It's either too theoretical or too broad and general with no real focus on real world software engineering.

Also, a european expeditionary author of the time wrote that half the Oromo population was wiped out under Menelik's expansion in incorporating the Oromos land into his Ethiopian Empire. 

Oromos also recall Menelik cutting off the right hands of men and breasts of women from a clan of Oromos who refuse to give up their system of governances even after nearly all their warriors were wiped out from Menelik's conquests. But, Amharas swear that never happened and it's just made up Oromo propaganda despite the fact that it was not an uncommon practice for Menelik.. don't know if this one relates to your question though."

3577,I,N,T,J,"Lol. No. But. Nothing wrong with getting frustrated. You don't have to keep it organized if you don't want to. If you want to, then do it. That simple bruh. But. At the same time. Mmm. Uhhhhh. Dealing with change has to do with being in an environment that harbors change. Either by surrounding yourself with people that are prone to it. Or just in general a situation that requires change. So ideally if you want to avoid it, avoid people who are prone to change or at least don't require you to engage in change, and/or choose a general environment that doesn't need much of it or at least doesn't require you to engage in much of it. A good xSTJ xNTJ combo of sorts where the xNTJ handles all the ""change planning"" and the xSTJ handles the repetition. But. Sorta with some caveats. Cuz that might actually (ironically)  not go as planned. You both sorta have to make sure you kinda seperate yourselves and not actually work, work together. but work seperately. Together. If you know what I mean. You trust xNTJ to handle planning for change. xNTJ trusts you to handle implementing plans or planning for routine. Etc. Kapish. Ok."
3578,I,N,T,J,"And who answers the questions on those tests buddy. You or someone else on your behalf... That's the literal point but you're too dimwitted to comprehend that.

Nevertheless, just for your information, the first thing that everyone that seriously selves into Typology knows is that tests are shit and they should always be taken with a grain of salt. Situations like these being the example as you're an obvious ISFP.

Wwwhhhhaaattttt???? You moron, having an accent means by your standard of pronounciation, someone else is ""pronouncing a word wrong"".

In case soulmates exist, maybe wait a little longer for that person. You don’t want them to be alone, right? How about the recipes and stories you’ll one day share and tell? You must tell them! You need to, so maybe wait a little longer to one day tell them. And don’t forget the people you have and will one day impact. You can’t leave them on the edge of their seats waiting for the time that you saved them from making a mistake. Just like I’m here to tell you not to do it. I may not know you, but I do love you. And I know that maybe even if the people around you don’t, you’ll one day soon get the people who love you around you. Travel the world first before you end it. Make sure to complete everything your heart desires before you call it quits. In the end, you only have one life.

I assume you are a loyal individual who won’t do anything to harm another person, so please make sure to make that clear with him. It’s okay to say this every now and then as a reminder that you will always be there. INTJ’s HATE liars!! Please also stop with any small talk which can cause us INTJ’s to lose interest, so please just dive into whatever. I think you would better be able to communicate over video chat or in person (if allowed)."
3772,I,N,T,J,"If he doesn’t talk to you, he probably doesn’t like you. We are pretty forward, and we aren’t into “hints”. Maybe be a bit more forward with him, and see where his head is at as well."

3788,E,N,T,P,"Well the cause of feeling a need to be special is a need for external acceptance because of the limiting belief that we are rejected because we are bad.

Essentially if you want to get over the need to be special you need to 1. Grow past your need for external validation of your worth and acceptance 2. You need to stop hating yourself and start accepting yourself 3. Accept that it's in fact a ridiculous notion to make or desire for other people to be responsible for accepting you.

Don't reject yourself."
3789,E,N,T,P,"Love is an action and not a feeling. You don't feel love. 

You can feel affection, attachment, possessiveness etc things that people attach to love but you don't feel love.

I thus conclude that love is action and it is proactive.

In that love can't be passive. You have to choose to love."
3790,E,N,T,P,"Read ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" Robert A. Glover
Now while you might not be what people think of when they say the term ""nice guy"" and I'm speaking particularly about the negative connotations.

 It helps because all the F types will always be more susceptible to ""Nice Guy Syndrome"" (if you're a boy/man).

 I would mention women too but nobody really cares if women are ""nice"" but being ""nice"" makes you less attractive to women as a general rule.

My friend and I read the book. We used to share the same concern you are (my friend is an INFP). Though we wouldn't readily admit it as far as romance or dating went we kind of sucked – we were upset and frankly a little miserable. I imagine you wouldn't be voicing this concern if you weren't at a point of active frustration.

Been there. 

So my friend and I. We read the book and to be honest with you I was a little mind blown. Some of the knowledge and I'd dare say wisdom in the book isn't something I might have concluded alone. I now have success in the manner that I want with women I like (granted they also like me as well, there's still that factor you can't control). 

Give the book a go though. I really think it'll help you fix the current issue you're experiencing and will help prevent it in the future as well. We wouldn't want you miserable."

I would say it's not a simple matter of just believing things without truth. It's an active indifference to trying to understand the natural world or reality outside what is useful for living their lives. To a large degree a lot of people don't even see their religion as a system of beliefs. I would say the whole structuring of their conscious awareness excludes the type of searches that us fellow atheists and agnostics go through.

It's to the point of even if you show them they'll feel like you're trying to destroy what they have and what works for them. Essentially trying to tear down their reality. They'd prefer the bullshit they know than the bullshit they don't."

3805,E,N,T,P,"To my understanding and more from experience there isn't really a blindspot.

I conceptualize it as such.

For an instinct to be dominant the other 2 are both ""repressed"" or effectively don't stand for their own principle. So for me I'm a Soc dominant Sx/Sp will often only be accessed so I can fulfill Soc.

In my own life I've noticed I bounce back and forth between focusing on Sp or Sx to fulfill my Soc goals. With neither really being preferred strongly over the other. What I do see however is a persistent orientation and alignment with Soc.

Now for Sx I see that I tend to look for a lot of separate people to have strong intimate ""naked"" (or maybe vulnerable is a better word to use) relationships with and it serves to also allow access to their social groups and what I call social arenas.

For Sp. I often feel like I'm not allowed to pursue community or group/social activities if I don't have my finances in order. I'm not psychically healthy etc.

However I don't tend to pursue either for their own sake. I only pursue Soc for it's owm sake but with different strategies. Now mind you this isn't even a fully conscious thing even though I'm aware of it and sharing. When I'm actually living life I don't think about this lol.

I'm saying all this to say I don't agree with tve blindspot idea. I see instinct more like enneagram type with wings. You can't be both sides at once.

Almost like a venn diagram where types intersect.

I also don't really believe or see the dominant wing theory play out in my life or maybe I just don't have a strong preference.

Often I relate strongly to 564 almost equally though 4 and 6 don't fully represent me. 

I'd also ask you this do you seriously not notice the contents of the instincts that aren't your dominant or do you simply not pursue their ends for their own sake but rather in service of the dominant instinct.

I personally think peopels propensity to ideate in terms of hierarchies creates this idea that there is a blindspot and and 2nd instinct in a sequence of 1 2 3 but I don't think that's the case.

I think our dominant instinct is like a Sun. Bright and with a strong gravity pull. The order instincts orbit it but feel inconsequential on their own."

Now something can't come from nothing and consequently something can't turn into nothing. 

So I truly believe when we die at best what happens is our consciousness is scattered.

Actually tbh I believe that the only thing that exists is the universe and we're just a different manifestation of that. The universe has always been perhaps not in the state it is now but it has.

I'm actually curious if the universe experiences cycles of death and rebirth as a whole.

Now I'm going to say these are conclusions I've come to recently and they're still young so if anyone has any critiques please bring them up.

I think I would say we're a part of the universe having a human, as we've named ourselves, experience. So nothing really matters more than we say it does.

3846,E,N,F,P,"I mean I agree with most of what you said.

&#x200B;

I feel like for Ti users, applying emotions to things is like applying emotions to math. Because you guys see the whole world like stuff to be solved. It'd be like wtf why would I care about the emotional meanings of numbers. For Fi it's like telling us to apply math to a painting. We'd be like wtf the painting is about a deeper emotional meaning why would we use math for that? But at the same time we can apply logic to things, as long as it's outside of our internal Fi process I guess and ya'll can apply emotions after you've analyzed it logically. 

&#x200B;

I think it works like:

&#x200B;

xxTJs: apply objective logic first, internal emotional meaning second

&#x200B;

xxFPs: find emotional meaning first, apply objective logic second

&#x200B;

xxFJs: use objective emotions/ethics first, find internal logical truth second

&#x200B;

xxTPs: find internal logical truth first, use objective emotions/ethics second

&#x200B;

I think it feels uncomfortable to be pressured to go out of order. And with the Ti/Fi clash either the Ti has to give up their internal logic process and appeal to their objective emotions or the Fi has to give up their internal emotional process and use their objective logic. And neither wants to ever do that.

When it comes to that Spirituality stuff I wouldn't present it as a known fact at all. I usually bring it up by saying ""I think"" or ""I feel like"". I know its not provable and its not for everyone, but I'd hate to ever be shut down while I'm brainstorming it. As far as I can tell you don't seem like you would. You'd probably just be bored.

&#x200B;

I guess I just dislike the avid nihilistic I'm so smart Ti users. Just no. I feel like unhealthy Ti is just an automatic nightmare to Fi users and vice versa.

&#x200B;

I do get bored of cold logic when I'm in my Fi process sort of. Like I don't want logic applied to my emotional philosophies because my goal isn't for it to be logical or provable. It feels like its missing the point. But other than that I love learning about science and facts, and I swear I could listen to someone talk about stuff like the theories of advancement of technology for hours. I can apply logic to concepts outside of me, but in my internal world I prefer to just analyze things for its emotional meaning I guess.

&#x200B;

I'm really just agnostic and research spiritual concepts to find what makes sense to me. I grew up christian but then realized there was too many flaws to be ignored and that the only reason I was christian was because I was scared of eternal damnation. See it wasn't ""logic"" that made me finally stop being a christian but I came to the emotional realization that, ""if there was a God that loved you, he wouldn't want you to love him out of fear. Because that wouldn't be a God. And there can't be hell, because a God that loves you wouldn't give up on you."" And yeah you could logically break down the inconsistencies of what I believed there lol but it just makes sense to me.

&#x200B;

It's like Te helped me realize that christianity was logically wrong, but I needed to analyze it with Fi internally and do like ""soul searching"" to let go of it. But someone with Ti would do it in reverse, like they might realize what's wrong with christianity ethically Fe and then analyze it deeply logically to find the flaws.

&#x200B;

My parents are both super Christian. My ISTJ mom is the most painfully traditional christian. ISTP dad always watches documentaries and reads articles about history and science, and he also watches scientific Christian documentaries that logically support the religion, and backs it up with proof and evidence that the Bible is true. If anyone could convince you of why Christianity is logical it'd be him LMAO. 

&#x200B;

Anyways so the Ti/Fi clash mostly exists when both people don't care about each other? Makes sense.

&#x200B;

Well thanks for letting me know how Ti works random asshole on the internet! I did not understand that function completely, and I used to think I have it since duh I analyze things deeply all the time. Ti and Fi both analyze but for different goals."
3847,E,N,F,P,"Of course it's subjective, most art and deep emotional things is subjective, that doesn't make it any less valid or meaningful. I find it valuable but whether or not you find it valuable is also subjective.

If you think it's inherently irrational to come to the conclusion that something can't be true if you can't disprove it, then why did you regard spirituality stuff as bullshit? So you think what you said was irrational then or

Fi doesn't ""distort reality"" you're misinterpreting Fi completely. Thats lowkey calling Fi users crazy just because you don't understand it lol. You use subjective logic so you might come to your own conclusion that Fi just distorts reality, but that's not the point of what it does. It gives emotional meaning and to you that might seem distorted, but for Fi users that's pretty clear. 

Of course I'm not going to use Fi for like a math class or objective problem solving, if that's what you meant. The combination of it being an introverted function and being about emotions would be terrible to use in external situations like that. Even writing arguments has to come from my Te, if I only used Fi in an argument it would just be really weird lol.

Feelers already have critical thinking skills, and that's another thing you guys get wrong. The ability to brainstorm and problem solve isn't just with the functions. I hope you're not implying that I don't like thinkers and I fear being a well rounded person?? I know there's a lot to learn from each other and I've had lots of thinkers in my life like I was raised by both ISTJ and ISTP and 2 of my best friends are an INTJ and INTP.

Yeah I totally agree I would never use Fi to explain the physical world, but I would use Fi to explain meaning to the physical world. I don't see why you're saying I can't compare and contrast the differences though, I mean you just did and you explained it well anyway. I think it's totally fine to compare it to actually understand the differences. And it does have similarities, not in how it operates, but in that they're both internal analyzing systems. Just like Fe+Te does the same thing in opposite ways.

Intuition is what could be and Fi is the emotional meaning behind ""what could be"" while Ti is the ""how"" behind ""what could be"". I used to be confused as to why a lot of xSFPs like spirituality, deeper emotional concepts and stuff but that's why. It just gets more heightened with Ne+Fi.

Respecting my beliefs is basically not telling me I'm automatically wrong if you can't disprove it? Respecting my beliefs would be to not call me a dumb ass for thinking of the possibilities of a deeper purpose for why we exist here. And even you thinking I'm clearly wrong without even knowing what I believe is an example of what I'm talking about. But people that think the way you do physically can't understand that. I will never understand why its hard for people that think that way to respect that some people like to have emotional meaning beyond logical reasoning. And of course I identify with my beliefs I have Fi, and of course I'm going to take it personal if someone shuts me down and calls me names because of what I believe. But regardless I just avoid talking to people like that, the majority of people I talk to are open minded and understanding regarding that stuff. A lot of people do believe what I believe or brainstorm anyway. And even after all that I'm mostly private with it I wouldn't just randomly talk about deep stuff with anyone

Even my ISTP dad is pretty chill with listening to my theories, as he knows he can't prove or disprove it so he just respects whatever I want to think. We have good discussions about stuff actually and he'll sometimes apply my theories to scientific things he's seen, which gives me a greater understanding of it without him outright shutting me down, so we're both happy. It's just once in a while I'll run into the atheist equivalent of a Jehova witness who just can't see outside of their own logical process (tunnel vision).

Anyways I get how Ti works and that they need to break things down logically and don't see the value in emotional meanings to things, but I've known both naturally accepting Ti users and some that are not"
3848,E,N,F,P,"No I'm not saying Ti is exactly too logical, I'm just saying that there is more to life beyond logic but Ti can't think outside of the logical box. Theres nothing wrong with that, it's just I'd rather not discuss potential beliefs and ideas with them if they're the kind to shut it down. Also not all Ti users will shut down my ideas, it's usually the more nihilistic ones that do. 

For example I grew up religious and almost had religious trauma from it or something and I was freaked out about my beliefs for a while and my ENTP ex repeatedly told me christians were dumb and criticized them all the time and I told him it stressed me out and asked him to stop and he wouldn't.

And no I wasn't even referring to INTPs lol I've never known one that hurt my feelings on purpose or anything. But I don't think I would discuss any philosophical emotional purpose of life with them. Like you said Ti would probably be bored of that because there's no logical ""point"" to it.

And yes it's subjective feeling, but we also use objective logic through Te for evidence if we need to. Ti is also subjective which is why it clashes with Fi. And the point of Fi isn't to be objective, it's just philosophy and emotional morality that goes on internally. Science is a kind of philosophy but it isn't the entirety of it. There's more to philosophy than just the provable facts.

Imagination isn't limited to NFs, but Ti does narrow down the imaginative process more than it does for NFs, and that's not a bad thing, I think Ti dislikes the outlandish imagination with no bounds that NFs have. It helps NTs be more practical with their imagination.

And I can speculate what happens after death, beyond the logistics of ""science"". I don't have evidence beyond my own personal life experiences. And that's fine that Ti would get bored of it but I'd be bored of only putting logic on it. That's what I mean by Ti being restrictive, if something can't be proved immediately you can't theorize it. For example I listen to Allan Watts and he has deep insights about the meaning of existence. Ti wouldn't be open to hearing about anything that isn't in the confines of logic, and that to me is boring and dull. I know everyone is different but I personally can't grasp why anyone wouldn't want to find some kind of meaning for ""why"" we're even here, beyond the scientific concrete reasons. Like if I asked a Ti user that, they would tell me how the world was created in the beginning of time. But my question is ""why"" anything was created at all. 

For Ti since you guys need a provable truth, so it would be boring. You guys think its bullshit and I think it's boring to not question what's beyond this reality and ""ego"" and stuff. You don't like to ponder what you can't prove and that's why it's restrictive. 

In your opinion I'm oversimplifying it, but that's just what Te does. We simplify stuff, that doesn't make it not true. And how is it not true? You said yourself you need an objective truth, evidence, and proof. So if you can't prove it, it isn't true to you guys or bullshit like you said.  

Fi does tamper with the external world through Te, because both of those work together. And of course you can compare Ti and Fi. They both work as an internal decision making compass, but in different ways. That's why it clashes. Fi isn't used to figure out what's true or what isn't, its used to decide what they believe or what they don't based on emotional evidence and moral patterns. And Ti automatically regards that as bullshit, which can be annoying and make us not want to talk to you.

I haven't talked to many Ti users, so I'm only really referencing my nihilistic and hard atheist ex who'd shove his beliefs at everyone the same way super christians would. I'd just like a Ti user to respect my beliefs and deeper ""emotional"" or philosophical insights about the world because for me that's like your logic for you."
3849,E,N,F,P,He said fuck women
3850,E,N,F,P,"What is too much? And sure imagination may not be realistic to you but theories about the world have to start somewhere. I’m not really using emotions when I’m brainstorming possibilities unless I want to.

No ones ever really found my theories to be boring so that doesn’t really apply lol. I mean unless you’re bored by philosophy which I guess some people are, but usually people are blatantly obvious when they don’t want to talk about deeper stuff and I’ll stop. Like 

Okay and that’s fine if you guys find imagination solely for the sake of it to be boring, but I find logic where it doesn’t need to be to be boring. Like if I’m not talking about science why are you adding science to it? I’m able to both discuss logical scientific theory things and also deeper meanings at different times but I guess NTs need it to be only logical. So yeah they could be “bored” of my theories but I’m also bored of how they’re dampening my creativity and ideas, so I probably should just stick to talking to NFs about that stuff lol.

INTJs usually can discuss deeper meanings without the need to only be scientific with me though idky.

I don’t think Fi is only about emotion, it’s about a deeper meaning or deeper purpose, so that’s probably the underlying pursuit of our imagination. It isn’t for some provable truth, it’s to find some meaning that seems believable enough to bring a sense of purpose and meaning to being alive, usually rooted in some kinds of philosophy or beliefs. And then when Ti users try to disarm that it’s like yo chill why are you trying to take away my purpose I’ve fine tuned for years. Like the goal isn’t provable logic, the goal is in depth meaning

One thing NTs can’t accept is that there’s no way to prove what happens when we die but still they shoot down any theories about the afterlife and physically can’t think about it. Maybe uncertainty just makes them uncomfortable and they like to only think about what they can prove. But NFs love trying to find meaning in uncertainty. And once again INTJs usually can also brainstorm that stuff with me. I’ve never met an ENTJ but I highly doubt they’d wanna sit and brainstorm anything if it wasn’t for some goal lmao.

Ti IS restrictive, Fi is also restrictive and yet we’re a bit more fluid, at times I want to listen to someone tell me the theories of technological advancement for hours, at other times I want to brainstorm philosophy and deeper meanings of existence and the possible “purpose” of why we’re here. Ti only likes to do one of those. Ti thinks if we can’t prove it it’s not real, Fi thinks if we can’t disprove it then it could be real"

Until finally I had an abusive relationship and he was violent and psycho and isolated me from everyone. And he kept coming and harassing me and even hacked me until my brain “broke”

Years later I’m just a complete introvert now and I hate being around people I feel like an INFP"
3856,E,N,F,P,"Well since everyone’s sharing 😂I’m an ENFP with an ISTP dad and ISTJ mom. Yes conflict was bad at times if only we knew about Mbti

We had fights a lot though and he couldn’t deal w any emotions but he’d always try to make peace after I think he was forced to use his inf Fe a lot

Istj mom had ✨issues when I was a kid not bc of her type and she got better when I got older and acts like a normal istj and we’re close now. I just talk to her about theories and my ideas for hours as she nods and listens to it 😂

3863,E,N,F,P,Sounds hot
3864,E,N,F,P,"Yes because Fi is more like a moral analytical system, more than a moral compass which most people think. 

I know thinkers usually have a few set of simple morals that they fall back on if they have to

But feelers are constantly analyzing and refining their morals lol"
3865,E,N,F,P,"Well even the theory of there being more to life beyond logic, would have to be in the constrains of some kind of logic. Even the illogical has logic to it, it just might be less acceptable logic.

So their existential theory is kind of right, even if life is an illusion, there would have to be logic that creates that illusion. 

Logic is important but I think she means that sometimes it’s kind of deconstructive because NTs or Ti users will tunnel vision a bit with their logical process if something doesn’t automatically make sense to them instead of being open to more possibilities. It makes them smart because they can rule out the BS but sometimes they rule out too much 

Like I’ve experienced that because I have a lot of existential theories about the “meaning” of why we’re here and if it isn’t automatically backed up by science they’ll disagree or something, before I can even finish theorizing. Like for example no one knows where we go when we die so I want to theorize about that just purely from imagination and speculation but they dislike stuff that they can’t prove logically and will bring the subject back to “science” even when that’s wasn’t my point

Logic limits the imagination a lil sadly. That’s why I prefer Te personally because it doesn’t intrude in my imagination too much 😂"

3878,E,N,F,P,"Social anxiety disorder. I have it. It’s common for xNFPs I think.

The way to deal with it is to genuinely instill confidence in yourself and completely alter your mentality and perspective on everything. And you have to reinforce it everyday until it becomes natural.

What I’d done for years is remind myself that I don’t give a fuck what anyone else thinks. They wanna judge me? Fuck em. You have to reshape your brain to not be fixated with approval of others. They are just as flawed and anxious and more worried about themselves and how others perceive them. They are imperfect. Why would you want approval from someone who’s already flawed? Do they know better than you or something? You’re probably smarter and more insightful than them even if you don’t think you are. Einstein doesn’t care about approval from an idiot.

I saw an ENTP say to be confident with your flaws. Socially awkward? Be confident with your social awkwardness and treat it like a hilarious quirk. 

Everytime you’re anxious you just have to remind yourself of these things and slowly it will start coming more naturally and the anxiety won’t have as much room as it used to. If you fear the fear the fear will just get worse.

You have to actually change your mentality and mindset with this kind of disorder, because it usually stems from an inferiority complex, unstable self image, and deep insecurities.

You have to remember that you are the fucking shit and you don’t give a fuck about people’s opinions."
3879,E,N,F,P,ENFP= were not surface level dumb people. Being bubbly doesn’t mean stupid. ENFPs have a lot of depth and usually will have a widespread amount of random knowledge.

And then I don’t even notice they don’t return it at all. I’m like this best friend side character to them, even though I’m struggling badly w my own life and wish I could have support.

I was just thinking about how much I miss having extroverted kinds of friends :( I’m going through a lot and it was nice to have people around me be so loving. But we drifted after I moved years ago. I had 2 ExFJ friends, 1 ENFP, 1 ENTP and they were outwardly supportive to me"

3951,I,N,T,P,"I lack air, so while I don't attract them, I find myself drawn to them cause they are the smart signs and I love intelligence."
3952,I,N,T,P,"I just want to interject here. Last example that you gave, can also line with an INTP. I would cross that off of the list. I am an INTP myself (professionally typed, so yes, I am) as well as another INTP that I know we both love nature, and are in to spiritualist types of things. Came across a few INTPs that love to write as well. 

Still convinced that this person is an IXFP, but I just wanted to throw that out there."
3953,I,N,T,P,OP sounds like a nararrator. You should do something bomb with your voice cause it sounds amazing as fuck.
3954,I,N,T,P,"Minus the ""I hate myself bit"" yeah, this seems pretty accurate. 😂"
3955,I,N,T,P,"How it started for me: Poor house

How it COULD have been: ""Yeah you can definitely get in to Harvard with your grades. 

Me: WHY YOU NO TELL ME SOONER?! 

How it went: got pregnant and worked jobs instead of taking basic college seriously. Graduated at a community college.

Now: Confused 😑😑😑😑"
3956,I,N,T,P,A true astrologer will tell you that everything in your chart matters. Some things just hold more weight than others.
3957,I,N,T,P,"I hate being in the house, but I love just being OUTSIDE with no people. Getting to the store is not a headache, places that are normally crowded aren't, I love to spend time in nature as well.

3958,I,N,T,P,Link?
3959,I,N,T,P,Just found the website and this goes by birthday. This would be inaccurate to type someone.
3960,I,N,T,P,"Some anime, just like many other TV shows, fix characters so that things can for the most part, stay the same. What would have happened if Retsuko DID become famous? How would she have evolved? What if Haida DID date the other girl (what ever her name was)? Could the show still run? I think that the end made it seem like they've changed, but when season 4 comes out, I bet it'll be the same things essentially with tweaks here and there. Or maybe her and Haida decide to date and then just like with Unicorn guy, something drives her into an insane rage which makes either one of them walk away from each other."
3961,I,N,T,P,Agreed. Haida's confused and desperate and Retsuko is a good two shoes push over who wants to embody responsibility but is two orders away from blowing an artery in her brain.
3962,I,N,T,P,You captured my husband (Jotaro Kujo) perfectly. ♥️

This needs to go there."
3964,I,N,T,P,Yes it actually is. Thank you. 😊
3965,I,N,T,P,"One question, how do I use this? Do I do it specifically for planetary degrees (e.g. My Taurus 6 degrees 24 minutes) or where the houses transition to (I guess this applies to Placidus and not whole sign/equal house — e.g. Leo in first house ends in 21 degrees 22 minutes)?"
3966,I,N,T,P,Thank you. 😊
3967,I,N,T,P,Ohhhh
3968,I,N,T,P,"Does this work in reverse as well? 🤷🏾‍♀️

My moon is 0 degrees cancer...does this mean that I have some Gemini moon traits as well?"
3969,I,N,T,P,What does OTP mean? On the phone?
3970,I,N,T,P,Didn't know this. Where can I find interpretations for planets and their degrees? Like is there something that I should plug and chug in to Google or something different?
3971,I,N,T,P,Definitely yes. Bigger the better.
3972,I,N,T,P,"This is DEFINITELY NOT an unpopular opinion....also, I agree. 😊 Fit women are just naturally attractive to me...and I'm a woman myself."
3973,I,N,T,P,"I'm Saturn in 8th in Placidus....7th if you do Whole House. 😅 Either way, both placements are rough I hear.

Edit: it also looks like you have a Saturn in the 8th as well."

3975,I,N,T,P,"Umm, my Chiron is in first. 🤷🏾‍♀️

But I did come from a poor family.

Idea of (outer (and some inner)) self is pretty shot though, so yeah"
3976,I,N,T,P,"Better question: why does SOCIETY feel this way? I think that it's just so weird all the way around and creates a false narrative in to what the world is really like. The children need to learn young that it's okay to express themselves, just like older people need to learn as well. Happy ≠ only emotion."
3977,I,N,T,P,"Not sure that this is an unpopular opinion. Many people feel this way. Still, it's annoying as hell and I agree."
3978,I,N,T,P,I don't see how this was removed? This group confuses me.
3979,I,N,T,P,Couldn't disagree more with this. 🤷🏾‍♀️
3980,I,N,T,P,"Y'all all just sound like blessings in this thread. Bless all of you cool, calm, collected thinkers."
3981,I,N,T,P,"You sound like a blessing from heaven tbh. No I'm not trying to be sarcastic. Having a handle on just about everything seems so nice. Working hard is definitely a plus. Capricorn feels right at home in 6th. You should be lucky tbh. Now, I'm not so sure how Venus would react in there, but are you VERY logical?"
3982,I,N,T,P,"I think that it if was consistent enough (meaning as soon as I made progress, my insurance got cut off every time), it would have. 🤷🏾‍♀️"
3983,I,N,T,P,"I honestly don't know how to work through them tbh, as emotions don't really make sense to me. I've been going to therapy since I was 12 years old (off and on), and now I'm close to 30. I should be cured now, right? 

I've also heard of confirmation bias, but didn't know that it had a name. Ironically I was talking to my boyfriend about that earlier about something else."
3984,I,N,T,P,"Seriously, thank you for this. I'm glad that my post reached even one person because I didn't think that people would see it honestly. I know that so many people on here come from at least decent homes or have at least decent parents. My mom is a lot better now and my dad doesn't exist, so I have a pseudo dad who is my cousin. Still besides my boyfriend, pseudo dad and (speaking very loosely) my mom, I really don't have a support system, so yes, you are right indeed and that is my goal in the end is to just not have people feeling like they are the only ones who has their own backs. I want to help others succeed in life sufficiently so that they don't have to rely on someone else, or at least find a way to help others cope somehow. As I've always said: it's too many people in this world for so many to feel alone, unheard, and unloved. 

It seems that for your reply to be like this, you must be going on a very good path in life. I sincerely wish you all of the best and you remind me to not stray in to the darkness, but to be a light for more people. ☺️"
3985,I,N,T,P,Bless him. I'm sure that he's looking down on you smiling. ☺️♥️
3986,I,N,T,P,"I may not know much about astrology, but your dad has the same house placements as me with Taurus being the sun and leo rising. Everything that the person said about your dad, I agree with because people say the same about me. I guess its a Taurus sun Leo rising type of thing. ☺️"
3987,I,N,T,P,"Nah, not for me. I will do the former part, but then I'll work on 1-2 things for a bit, then crash, lol. Still did something so I feel good about myself. 😂"
3988,I,N,T,P,"Sorry, nah. I don't like doing the same thing time and time again. It's just not my thing."
3989,I,N,T,P,I was thinking that too. He's not an 8 at all.
3990,I,N,T,P,"Saturn in Aquarius in 8th. I recently quit my corporate job to start my own business. Been in corporate since I could first work. Just wanted to point out that irony there.

since you aren't doing keto for weight loss have you tried looking up various other diets that may give you the energy without as much restriction? there's that one where people eat giant has pop tarts and always say ""if it fits your macros!"" idr what it's called"

4054,I,N,T,J,"so, i had an accident quite a few years ago and i lost the ability to taste anything sweet. its made me appreciate and experience taste differently because the sweetness isnt getting in the way and hiding all the other flavors. sweetness is extremely powerful and overwhelming and tbqh rather gross.

i can't taste vanilla ice cream, i can sometimes taste sugar dissolved in liquids but its rather a moot point now...like snowballs don't taste sweet but soda does depending in which soda.


maybe keto isn't for you and that's okay c: you say you like the energy boost you get from it but at what cost does it come? you seem really conflicted.

 have you tried experimenting with carb cycling?

edit: i can taste sweetness of artificial sweeteners except for swerve..it has something in it that causes the  tongue to detect fhe fake sugar as real sugar...i cant taste it at all...uts like sand in my mouth"
4055,I,N,T,J,"You grew up eating carbs, you will pretty much always think carbed up food tastes better because that's your palate. I don't think you'll find satisfaction because of your mindset. Last i checked lowcarb soft tacos usong lowcaeb tortillas taste the same as high carb soft tacos

you're also of the mindset that it limits social eating so you have a negative view from that angle. Many of us feel no limitation. 

i think this is all surrounding the fact that you see keto as denying yourself life instead of something that adds to your life. it's not about the food you're eating, it's your mindset. If you can change that and stop comparing and learn to give each dish a fair evaluation of its complexities and flavor profile instead of being like ""this would be so much better with a streaming pile of semolina pasta"". yannowhatimean?"

a few others in my life have assumed im an extroverted and then became incredibly pissed off with me when their assumption proved to be wrong....""you pretended to be someone you aren't"", ""you lied"", ""i dont know who you are!"" well...maybe...MAYBE try to get to know me instead of making me up in your head."

Venus square Jupiter can sometimes signify poor luck in the area of love or money. It can also signify indulgence in what you love.

Saturn in the 7th House -- You will probably me attracted to marriage or you will draw people to you that seem to stick around awhile or want to.

Moon/Saturn in the 7th -- You might be attracted to a partner just like your mom/dad depending on your relationship with them.

You probably will be drawn to or make a best match with people who have water and fire in their chart. Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio, Leo, Aries, Sagittarius.

Cancer & Leo stand out.

4102,E,S,T,P,"Okay, well immediately I picked up on something to do with drugs...or an addiction to a drug.... plus nausea or stomach issues... I keep feeling the urge to throw up ...."
4103,E,S,T,P,Did she pass away due to Cancer or some kind of brain/head injury? I wanna know if I'm connecting to the right person...
4104,E,S,T,P,"As soon as I saw his picture, I felt the urge to throw up and as though he had been going down a path he was ashamed of... I'm getting that he blamed/blames himself for the way things turned out in his life... He got into some sort of trouble or something. There is something specific coming to mind but I like to be careful because I'm not sure if it will be offensive or not. He feels distraught or regretful... If this does not resonate, throw it to the wolves...  I don't really read anyone much but that is what came in, so I decided to share. ♡"
4105,E,S,T,P,"I know this is an old post but I kept being told, ""oh sweety.."" like she totally adores you..and she kept mentioning something about being with grandma.."
4106,E,S,T,P,"Awww no... :( x
Here's all the loving vibes your baby can get..such a cute and sweet looking dog. *hugs for you both*"
4107,E,S,T,P,"I've never heard of that, ""surgical psychosis"" -- I'll have to Google that one. I hope you guys will be okay x."
4108,E,S,T,P,Ah... Yes.. I had a similar experience. My mom even whipped a Bible out.
4109,E,S,T,P,Yup but do you feel possessed by it of?
4110,E,S,T,P,You've described this pretty well. Interesting.
4111,E,S,T,P,Nope... It helps me but I do it for the high.. I've got a few years left in me. 🤣
4112,E,S,T,P,"There is another disorder called, ""Dissociative Trance Disorder"" where the person feels possessed by something outside of their control. I ran across this while researching DID. Thanks for sharing your experience in depth."
4113,E,S,T,P,I understand what you mean. I've felt possessed quite a few times. It's like an out of body experience.
4114,E,S,T,P,How relatable.
4115,E,S,T,P,"
You will only be made out to look like a ""stalker"" and you better believe that is the route he will take. Narcs usually do. Take it from me -- It's best to just move forward. It is much more peaceful. 

If people can't be logical enough to get BOTH sides to a story before believing one or the other, then they're not worth explaining yourself, anyways."
4116,E,S,T,P,"It is understandable to feel the way you do but whatever you do, do not contact him because he will take the ""stalker"" route with quickness and without hesitation. Even if you were abused and felt you needed to vent or like you wanted answers from the abuse and him using you, usually Narcs do not care. They have no tender feelings or remorse and will gossip that you're a stalker and even may find a way to get the law involved. 

I hope you continue to get through this. Things always seem to get worse before they get better. ♡"
4117,E,S,T,P,This is such a rare case. Most of the Narcs never get diagnosed. It would be nice if more were because this is destroying lives.
4118,E,S,T,P,"Usually, the IT, (The demon aka Narc) -- starts seeking new supply during while they're dealing with you...so that they will never be left without. This is also why they seem to ""move on"" so fast. I've found the best way to move on from a Narc is to start viewing it as an IT. An object. A foreign demonic entity. A shark. It has helped me move on."
4119,E,S,T,P,"I agree with Verucca Salt here in saying this was a very insightful post to read. I always stated, it is an insult to be proposed to and married to the Narc (the IT) -- because the Narc marries those he/she sees as weak and easily controlled. The new supply the Narc got AFTER I stopped giving IT what IT wanted, started getting abused WORSE than I ever was because she didn't cut IT off or stand up to IT.  The Narc preys on those they view as weak."
4120,E,S,T,P,"Yeah, you have to be careful with reaching out to others and especially with a Narc. They will flip everything around on you. If you attempt to expose ANY information you've got on them, they WILL turn it around on you and call you a stalker...and if they are REALLY vindictive, they will drag you to court. It truly is best to try to move forward but I get it is terribly tough.. especially when you want others to see what kind of monster the Narc is.."
4121,E,S,T,P,THIS.
4122,E,S,T,P,"Well said. I think they are broken from an insecurity, wherever it came from.. Someone secure in themselves wouldn't feel the need to lure people in or get others ""addicted"" to them by playing adolescent mind games and using manipulative tactics. That shows major insecurity and they need to not feel defeated nor insecure. So, they will seek supply and use anything they can to avoid feeling that way. Regardless, if they are actually broken or not -- they abuse so bad and feel no remorse to the point, their probable ""brokenness"" does not matter. They deserve every ounce of karma they get if they ever do."
4123,E,S,T,P,"Amen, sister!"
4124,E,S,T,P,"Sometimes our feelings trap us and aren't the best to give into. You have nothing to feel guilty about. It's okay to feel sympathy for someone else's situation but it's not your fault nor your responsibility to be there for someone who is not returning the favor. I agree with Shutterbug.  Even if she does not recognize this as abusive, it is and you should draw back. It sucks but..."
4125,E,S,T,P,"I agree with what Shutterbug has stated. She is using you, which is also abuse. She might have a new favorite person and so, you are naturally being left to hang..

If it's not that, it could be that she was in, what I like to call a ""BPD Fog"" -- Meaning she may have been in an idealizing phase with you...and felt things super intensely. Now, her perception of you has probably changed and she doesn't feel that way, anymore.

I cannot read her mind but going by what you wrote, it seems like you are no longer her favorite person. I'm sorry this is happening to you. It really isn't right/fair."
4126,E,S,T,P,"Yup.. When it comes to Narcs, I always say the ""Benefit Of the doubt"" is dangerous!!!"
4127,E,S,T,P,I enjoyed reading this because of the maturity throughout.. It' scary to have kids with a Narc because they only see the kids and extensions as themselves... D:
4128,E,S,T,P,THIS. Narcs get married and sometimes the marriages last awhile because the current partner isn't as privy to the Narcs tactics as you were. Narcs never change.. They sometimes learn to be sneaky in a smarter way...
4129,E,S,T,P,Yup. The way you wrote these words here is EXACTLY what the Narc did to his new supply. His new supply started feeling mindf@!d by him and left all social media because he would bait her and then ignore. It's NEVER good for ANYONE involved unless they're not hooked on the Narc & don't care.
4130,E,S,T,P,"I actually enjoy fighting, not because I'm a badass but because I enjoy physical exertion, period. However, I don't wanna go to jail and etc. I've been in many altercations due to having a bad temper but only one fist fight. 

If there was a such thing as Fight Club, I'd definitely join."
4131,E,S,T,P,"If they flat out ask me if I find them attractive or whatever, I'll answer honestly. If they get mad, that is their problem..

On the other end, if they simply express interest without asking me if I like them back -- I'll just flat out lie to spare myself the trouble having to deal with them in the future. I'll be like, ""Oh... I don't date or blah blah blah"".. So that they won't pursue in the future...Yet, they won't dump their emotional reactions, (which are not my responsibility) onto me because of my lack of interest. Nobody wants to deal with all that. 

If they keep pressing me though, I'll just get super blunt and cuss 'em out. That's usually how it goes."
4132,E,S,T,P,"I'm not sure if it's an Estp thing but I ask a billion questions as well. Maybe it's our ""Ti"" seeking to collect as much knowledge about someone or something because it's our natural mode in life. 

..to know every aspect/ detail of whatever reality we're dealing with at the moment. To me, it's also a bit strategic as well."
4133,E,S,T,P,I'm bisexual and have been that way since elementary school.
4134,E,S,T,P,Exactly... Then the mask falls off...tragic.
4135,E,S,T,P,"With any other personality disorder, (aside from Antisocial PD), I would be more careful. However, those who suffer from NPD/ASPD are less likely to go see a psychiatrist. To me, especially dealing with a Covert Narc, it's d*mn near impossible to recognize the signs unless you deal with one directly.

So, for now, it seems as though we are pretty much on our own until society opens their eyes I guess."
4136,E,S,T,P,"The silent treatment on/off is a BIG one they use...especially the Covert Narcs. You've gotta think -- They must be REALLY insecure that they have to resort to the silent treatment to prove to themselves the world cares SO MUCH about them that they keep reaching out.

Meanwhile in reality, most people would want answers when someone suddenly just cuts them off without explanation. It's like, give everyone a break. Their EGOs are SO huge.."
4137,E,S,T,P,So epicccc!!!!!
4138,E,S,T,P,"Yeah, Mal is SO hot!!!!"
4139,E,S,T,P,"Nope. Me and my sister keep up with the book Author's twitter but so far, no announcement to my knowledge. So, you played the book in a week?! I like to make these things last. 😅"
4140,E,S,T,P,"Being needed is such a copout lol
Edit: I answered this with my mind on sex.

I don't wanna be needed unless I'm getting paid. Everyone else can Google whatever."
4141,E,N,T,P,"Actually i found this theory that everyone used their Dom-Tert Functions first in the childhood. Around the ages of puberty they started to use their Aux Function, making them struggle to re-conquer their Tert Function. However, Tert Function was their nature, so people want to satisfy their Tert Function as the feedback of their Dom-Aux actions.

Some people say this only works for Observers (EXXP) and Judger (IXXJ) Types, so at least for ENTPs the order is like this:

Dominant: How you see the world.

Aux: How you make your decisions.

Tert: What you want as the feedback.

Inf: Your fear, weakness, and key point to your whole personality."
4142,E,N,T,P,This is correct.
4143,E,N,T,P,Ne-Ti in a nutshell.
4144,E,N,T,P,Yes i'm rock
4145,E,N,T,P,Any type but Sensors
4146,E,N,T,P,The only thing that i know for sure is true about your description is the unpredictableness. Maybe because Ne leads us and we are an Observer type. So we scan the connections and probabilities first and make it a priority and we could care less about actually do something about it. The feelings that i had came and passed so fast. It's like a bday surprise which surprises you atm but after 3 seconds it slips through. if you know what i mean.
4147,E,N,T,P,"INXX meme again, as always."
4148,E,N,T,P,# wow
4149,E,N,T,P,Is this charm? I've said stuff like that and i think those are normal. Maybe because i'm ENTP? But yeah i most of the time am the center of attention for a reason i don't know.
4150,E,N,T,P,Spot on
4151,E,N,T,P,Yeah i don't get it. Is this charm? Maybe it's because i'm ENTP? I mean i have no idea
4152,E,N,T,P,"Never said emotions are a weakness doe, but i got it that you said that because the stereotype of ENTPs. 

The psychopath/sociopath thing does not sound very interesting to me, though sometimes it works to get the reaction that my Fe wants. Some ENTPs say they are sociopaths not because they really think they are, they just want to get the people's reactions that their Ne has predicted in order to feed their Fe.

Actually i got this theory that everyone used their Dom-Tert Functions first in the childhood.

Inf: Your fear, weakness, and key point to your whole personality."
4153,E,N,T,P,This is the best one lmao
4154,E,N,T,P,"It's subjective really. But i think yes, by the means that i have a very high flexibility of my future plan/image/scenario as my Ne has provided to me 24/7."
4155,E,N,T,P,"The Ti-Fe part is pretty much spot on. I love seeing people's reaction because it satisfies my Fe. Sometimes i do it in healthy ways. Sometimes i do it in unhealthy ways. I don't care if the person i'm arguing with is crying because i beat their opinion by their own logic that they used to attack my opinion, i just like to see their reaction. My Fe is fed. And i don't really feel guilty about it, but thinking that i'm breaking the social norms my Fe has told me about to not make someone cry, my Ne-Ti run and as a human being i'm worried that there may be a consequence to what i did (Inf Si)."
4156,E,N,T,P,"Uh, so basically we female Extroverts are generalized as EXFXs and most people don't think EXTX women is even a thing. So poor me."
4157,E,N,T,P,"Lol same. I was depressed for 2 years. At that time i wasn't constantly sad or feeling negative, just literally empty. I didn't feel the excitement of things like i used to do. I didn't feel the sadness from the bad things that happened in my life. I didn't cry at my grandpa's funeral because i felt nothing despite being very close to him. I ignored all my friends except for my ex gf. My life felt meaningless. But i don't think it has something to do with Ne-Fe. Or it has. Idk."
4158,E,N,T,P,Yeah religions are the virus.
4159,E,N,T,P,Ok. Thank you for the answer. I'm too lazy to google it haha
4160,E,N,T,P,You can actually. But ok.
4161,E,N,T,P,"Absolutely agree. These patriarchs act as if those 'studies' show any valid evidence of the causality of the difference of the social expectations between men and women, which is a false gender-stereotyping bias in the first place. Those studies only show the patterns.

I'll make this simple. In a pool there are 5 red ducks and 2 white ducks. Does that make a normal/healthy version of a duck is a red duck? Then people say ""Ducks are ugly because they are red!"" while ignoring the minority of the duck. If you know what i mean."
4162,E,N,T,P,"I know. Those means are determined by society because their religious teaching wants men to work and women to cook. Men to be the leaders and women to be the slaves. The masculine and feminine concepts were originally made to differ men and women or in other words to control people's lives. Those concepts are now used only for defining terms, but the origin of the concepts are what i said the cause of the terms to be damaging and unbeneficial to society in a larger scale."
4163,E,N,T,P,That is basically switch doe
4164,E,N,T,P,That's switch basically
4165,E,N,T,P,Married? That is some vanilla thing. Are you a girl?
4166,E,N,T,P,Reference pleaseee
4167,E,N,T,P,"Most, not all. Not the causality, but the pattern."
4168,E,N,T,P,I'm a female and a dom hey am i going to die soon?
4169,E,N,T,P,Well i'm a female and a dom so idk
4170,E,N,T,P,Exactly
4171,E,N,T,P,Bruh you're literally xNTP no xNTJ functions
4172,E,N,T,P,Well this true
4173,E,N,T,P,I'm a female ENTP and i know very little amount of people would believe me when i say that i'm a dom. Gender bias as always.
4174,E,N,T,P,Same
4175,E,N,T,P,Sorry you haven't met any healthy ENTP yet
4176,E,N,T,P,Why? I will provide my points as direct as possible. Don't take anything personally. I just want to know your reason :/
4177,E,N,T,P,"I just want to know your reason. Let's find the truth together. If you make some really good points on why using sexist words is okay, then i'll agree with you and change my opinion. And vice versa. More people would read it. More people would know."
4178,E,N,T,P,"I know. Mankind is a sexist word which came from the jewish mythology that the first human is a man and God created woman from man then they breed, making it indirectly incest. Historically the UK was controlled by religion just like most of the world, so that's where the word 'mankind' was invented.

I'm not offended. I think it's not accurate. It's time for change, patriarchy is not acceptable anymore."
4179,E,N,T,P,Idk i never mentioned anything about arrogance. I said i'm trying to master my Fe so i can use it properly in the right times and places.
4180,E,N,T,P,So what
4181,E,N,T,P,Jesus gonna be proud of you ></
4182,E,N,T,P,"Well wdym by that lmao, i can translate your words to some completely different things. What's your point?"
4183,E,N,T,P,"Because the origin of Feminism is the action to lift up females to be equal to men. Feminism does not make women higher than men.

The origin of the word 'mankind' is from the idea that the first human is a man, which is a religious propaganda. Scientifically it is wrong. Culturally, 'Man' words are used to refer to both men and women, which came from the idea that men are higher than women.

If you're a cult member then it's all gonna make sense why you're acting like this."
4184,E,N,T,P,"I mean i still want my parents to divorce because my dad's keep hurting my mom in some ways, though not as frequent as in my childhood. I want to save my mom. But she doesn't want to face reality. It tires me. So now i just keep telling myself to stay out of their problem because i have made a choice to cut them off my life."
4185,E,N,T,P,"I know. And that is not rigid. We should change it and use neutral words instead.

Why do some people want to mantain toxic cultural tradition?"
4186,E,N,T,P,Yeah same
4187,E,N,T,P,oh god oh fuck
4188,E,N,T,P,"*Human

Let's stop using sexist words."
4189,E,N,T,P,That's why i'm obsessed to master it rn
4190,E,N,T,P,I'm in this photo and i don't like it
4191,I,S,T,J,"Welcome! Not much happens here but we’re cool people.

We definitely don’t post selfie’s like on r/ESTP but feel free to ask for help if you need anything !"
4192,I,S,T,J,Oh my goodness. Came downstairs this morning and had the exact same thought .
4193,I,S,T,J,Thank you! This is awesome to know
4194,I,S,T,J,Okay... so my boyfriend told me the other day “could you do (a series of things)” and stopped halfway through and said “actually I’m going to do something you’ll like” and proceeded to make a list with checkboxes.. and I’m seriously in love with the man. Hahaha.
4195,I,S,T,J,"That’ll just be a rune rune, cause the rune rune won’t be seen on the rune rune"
4196,I,S,T,J,Omg. I came here to post this. Thanks mate!
4197,I,S,T,J,F
4198,I,S,T,J,"Hahaha! I kinda feel bad cause I just stopped talking to my old friends. Since I know how it works I knew they’d only try to get me back to the meetings and can’t be “true friends” because of that. I mean I’m having a extramarital relations with a boy, oh nooo. And you were worried about weed lolz."
4199,I,S,T,J,"I kinda hesitated before pressing play, not sure how I was going to feel. It’s been 4 years for me. 
My family left before I did so I have my family back now; a really loving boyfriend and peace in my heart."
4200,I,S,T,J,"Same here. Hello fellow fader, nice to talk to you lol"
4201,I,S,T,J,"df = disfellowshipped
Where you are “shunned” and members cannot speak with you"
4202,I,S,T,J,"Oh my goodness yes... I feel like I have to plan for spontaneity. If I have nothing planned, perfect. If you tell me specifically “let’s play it by ear/do whatever” perfect .. the plan is to not have a plan lol. 
If we have a plan and we don’t follow it, I get annoyed."
4203,I,S,T,J,Yup! I agree with the goal. I’m still struggling to see what job would be a good fit for me though.
4204,I,S,T,J,Was kind of stuck at what to vote for. Obviously I’m striving for Economic goals so I can finance my love of traveling (“having fun”). Ultimately I voted for Hedonistic.
4205,I,S,T,J,Always have a backup to the backup!
4206,I,S,T,J,Moral of the story: date ugly people.
4207,I,S,T,J,"One of the first lessons I learned in Psych 101 is “beauty = nice”

4208,I,S,T,J,We don’t exist.
4209,I,S,T,J,Oh my goodness! I didn’t realize I have an emotional situation script.
4210,I,S,T,J,Magnesium really helped me. It was night and day from when I started taking it and whenever I fall off the wagon and go days without it my migraines come back.
4211,I,S,T,J,Dude I feel you. Created a new account and was like “tf is this? Tf is that?” every 5 minutes
4212,I,S,T,J,Omg this is fucking hilarious
4213,I,S,T,J,"Oh man, and when they start screeching and running around and my puppy thinks it’s a game of chase and then the kids get scared that there is 60lb black dog chasing them.  But she’s a playful puppy! Lol"
4214,I,S,T,J,"Shoot, how old is she? 
I was hoping my puppy would grow out of it but I might have to take more serious measures then."
4215,I,S,T,J,Well I can see I’m not the only one...
4216,I,S,T,J,"Tell meee how long did it take for them to chill out together?? 
My puppy is 9months and still thinking the cat is a chasing toy most of the time."
4217,I,S,T,J,She kinda looks like an astronaut kitty
4218,I,S,T,J,"I’ll be honest, my boyfriend has a specific style too, and I normally stay away from buying him clothes and shoes unless I’m 100% sure he’ll like them. 
Sometimes I even let him choose what shoes/jacket etc he wants and I’ll buy it for him. And I’ve been with him for 4 years! Lol. 
I do that because I’m a victim of (my mom usually) wearable gifts that I absolutely hate and just take up space in my closet.
If you do want to go with the clothes route I would suggest going for something similar to what he already owns but in a different style- if he likes vans/ sneakers maybe something similar in a grey/black or with an accent color. 

What I get my bf usually depends- 
Does yours have any hobbies? Interests? Does he like to read? Play video games? Is he into computers and gadgets? Does he collect anything?
Watches! My bf can’t have enough watches. 

Hope that helps. 
I know gift buying can be stressful"
4219,I,S,T,J,"What color are his shoes usually ? Do they have some color in them or are they more neutral? 

Also- is there a reason why you’re buying these type of shoe? Does he need/want them?"
4220,I,S,T,J,2nd pair ! :)
4221,I,S,T,J,Same!
4222,I,S,T,J,I was looking for this. This is also where I saw your post
4223,I,S,T,J,"Hahaha, oh man. We can be annoying sometimes. Sorryy"
4224,I,S,T,J,"I’m sorry, coffee hasn’t kicked in- do you just watch the courses? How do you get certified? Is there a test?"
4225,I,S,T,J,"Hi, I'm not sure how old you are. But my parents divorced when I was 21. It hurt me because I thought my parents relationship was perfect (it wasn't) and as you grow up you realize that sometimes things don't work out with your SO.   


Your parents will be going through a lot, but give *yourself* time to heal. As someone mentioned before, your parents are still your parents. I still hang out with both of them and I clearly told them I did not want to know the details of their divorce and did not want to be involved or present for any badmouthing they might want to do towards or about each other. Let them know you're there for them and spend quality time with each of them."
4226,I,S,T,J,"Yes, but they wanted to know the next cross street lol."

4231,I,S,T,J,"Nooooooooooooooo! Not calculus!

4240,I,S,T,J,I have a bedtime. Lol

4297,E,N,T,J,"The ""dominant wing"" theory is a much more recent theory taught and popularized by an institution that did not learn the Enneagram directly from the source. It's a very specific concept, created by the same people who created the 9 Levels of Development. 

Originally, the ""wings"" were just the types adjacent to ours; nothing more, nothing less. Everyone had 2 wings, and it was understood that because of their proximity to our type, we would relate to both types quite a bit, with some individuals able to relate to their wings more than others. 

If you were a 3, you were just a 3. Not a 3w2 or a 3w4, but a 3. If you wanted to divide the types into subtypes, you paid attention to the dominant instinct, giving a total of three subtypes: SP 3, SX 3, and SO 3. 

My guess is that you're an SX 3: [https://www.personalitycafe.com/threads/sexual-threes-according-to-beatrice-chestnut.341498/](https://www.personalitycafe.com/threads/sexual-threes-according-to-beatrice-chestnut.341498/)"
4298,E,N,T,J,"Yes, they are. 

The ""wings"" people are familiar with are actually the dominant wing subtypes, of which there are 18. These were popularized and taught by the Enneagram Institute.

The subtypes are (like the other poster explained) each characterized by a respective instinctual drive, of which there are 3, giving us a total of 27 subtypes. These were the original model for the Enneagram, but they have been eclipsed by the newer winged subtypes. 

The fact that you don't know if your boyfriend is a 1 or a 6 suggests he is either an SP 1 or an SO 6, both of which are likely to mistype as the other type. You can read more about both types here:

4299,E,N,T,J,"I agree with all of these except 8. I know a lot of people think of Eights as the controlling type, but this is only a tiny portion of what these types are actually interested in, which is far more akin to Se. 

Te implies structure, routine, guidelines, objective criteria; things which Eights do not necessarily have an interest in. The passion of an Eight is about a lustful orientation to life, in which the senses are indulged, and is something which is erroneously attributed exclusively to Sevens."
4300,E,N,T,J,"1 is more S than N, as 1s were originally described to very tradition-oriented and very attentive to details, hence the perfectionist streak. 

3s are absolutely Te, and I do like that you put S also, cause 3s are very practical individuals. Everyone thinks of ENTJs when it comes to 3s, but I feel like that's very unfair to ESTJs.

4 being Ne doesn't make sense to me at all imo. The thing about 4s is their emotionality, their connection to their feelings that other types don't have. That longing is only really something which exists with Fi, and *maybe* Ni. 

5 is Ti, I don't think anyone has ever questioned that one. I could see how someone would think maybe Ni, but for the most part, I think everyone agrees 5 is Ti.

6 being Fi doesn't make sense at all either. Sixes are in the head triad, and these types are supposed to be very cerebral, and far too in their heads for this type to be anything other than Ti or Ni. Quoting Naranjo:

>\[Sixes possess\] a hyper-vigilance that is on the lookout for hidden meanings, clues, and the unusual. Aside from constituting a state of chronic arousal in the service of interpreting (potentially dangerous) reality, **it serves an excessive deliberation concerning what for others would be a matter of spontaneous choice.** I have borrowed Shapiro’s word “hyper-intentionality” for the extraordinarily rigid and tense directedness of behavior (of suspicious character) **as well as for the exaggerated need to rely on rational choices.** 

And also:

>Fear makes the coward unable to be sure enough to act, so that he never has enough certainty and wants to know better. He not only needs guidance, but also typically (distrusting guidance as well as needing it) solves this conflict through appeal to the guidance of some logical system or of reason itself. **Ennea-type VI is not only an intellectual type, but the most logical of types, one who is devoted to reason.** Unlike ennea-type VII who uses intellect as strategy, type VI is likely to worship intellect through fanatical allegiance to reason and reason alone—as in scientism. In his need for answers in order to solve his problems, type VI is more than any other a questioner, and thus a potential philosopher.  

The inability Sixes have to act spontaneously and from the gut suggests inferior Se, which aligns with Ni. 

7s are not Se, and this is a consequence of the party animal stereotype these types have. Sevens possess a *psychological* gluttony, which is far more akin to Ne than anything else—hence, why Naranjo referenced Jung's extroverted intuitive when writing of Sevens:

> I quote from Jung’s Psychological Types:  
>  
>*“The intuitive is never to be found in the world of accepted reality-values, but he has a*  
*keen nose for anything new and in the making. Because he is always seeking out new*  
*possibilities, stable conditions suffocate him, he seizes on new objects or situations with great*  
*intensity, sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm only to abandon them cold bloodedly… it*  
*is as though his whole life vanished in the new situation. One gets the impression, which he*  
*himself shares, that he has always just reached a final turning point… Neither reason nor*  
*feeling can restrain him or frighten him away from a new possibility, even though it goes*  
*against all his previous convictions… he has his own characteristic morality, which consists in*  
*a loyalty to his vision and in voluntary submission to its authority… Naturally this attitude*  
*holds great dangers, for all too easily the intuitive may fritter away his life on things and*  
*people, spreading about him an abundance of life which others live and not he himself.”* 

And when describing the gluttony of 7s:

>...Whether in the question of food or in other realms, **the gluttony of the glutton is typically not for the common, but, on the contrary, for that which is most remarkable, for the extraordinary.** In line with this is the characteristic interest in what is magical or esoteric itself, a manifestation of a broader interest in what is remote—either geographically, culturally, or at the fringes of knowledge.  
>  
>Also, an attraction to that which is beyond the boundaries of one’s own culture reflects the same displacement of values from here to there; and the same may be said of the typical anticonventional tendencies of type VII. In this case, the ideal may be in a utopian, futuristic, or progressive outlook rather than in existing cultural models.  

8s being Ni is way, way, way off the mark. 8s are impulsive and sensory; they're the exact opposite of Ni, and are therefore Se. They're in the gut triad for a good reason. Naranjo described these types as the most sensory of all types:

>...in ennea-type VII \[exists\] the predominance of action over intellect and feeling, **for this is the most sensory-motor of characters.** The characteristic orientation of ennea-type VIII to a graspable and concrete “here and now”—the sphere of the senses... **is a lusty clutching at the present and an excited impatience toward memory, abstractions, anticipations, as well as a desensitization to the subtlety of aesthetic and spiritual experience.** Concentration on the present is not simply as a manifestation of mental health as it could be in other character dispositions, but the consequence of not deeming anything real that is not tangible and an immediate stimulus to the senses. 

Hence why a lot of 8s are often mistyped as 7s."
4301,E,N,T,J,"Subtypes aren't new, they were part of the original theory. They were taught by Naranjo, Palmer, and David Daniels, who taught Chestnut.

The wing subtypes taught by Don Richard Riso are the new creation and the Levels of Development were his own creation as well."
4302,E,N,T,J,"I agree with the other poster. The fact that you are focusing on success as a general idea which covers different bases and focusing on intelligence and morality suggests 3.

4306,E,N,T,J,"Maybe, but I think it's pointless to pay attention to those hypothetical combinations in the first place. 

A lot of people who are interested in the Enneagram have taken an interest in other typology models, especially the MBTI, but one drawback is that they've began to see the two as complementary systems, in which one is motivation, and the other is behavior, as if the two were either/or exclusively. 

Originally, the Enneagram was *very* much about behaviors and characteristics. Fives and Sixes, for example, were introverted types, while Twos and Nines were extroverted types. We could sit down and argue that all combinations are possible, but I personally find that to be incredibly counterproductive; to pretend that correlations don't exist would be incredibly foolish. An INTP 5 is far more likely than an INTP 2, and an ESTP 8 is far more likely than an ESTP 4. 

Different authors have offered their own ideas, so I'll offer two that I know of. 

**According to Don Richard Riso:**

1. One = Extraverted Thinking (ExTJ)
2. Two = Extraverted Feeling (ExFJ)
3. Three = N/A
4. Four = Introverted Intuition (INxJ)
5. Five = Introverted Thinking (IxTP)
6. Six = Introverted Feeling = IxFP)
7. Seven = Extraverted Sensing (ESxP)
8. Eight = Extraverted Intuition (ENxP)
9. Nine = Introverted Sensing (ISxJ)

I disagree with Riso on **a lot** of things completely, and this is definitely one of them. Although he has typed himself as a 4, I long suspect that Riso was an SP 6, hence why his whole system revolves around fears in the first place. Not only that, but it's widely agreed that Fours are *very*  correlated with introverted feeling types; no other system has actually correlated Fours with introverted intuition. 

Sevens and Eights should be switched imo. Eights are very sensory types, hence why they're in the gut triad. Likewise, Sevens are cerebral and psychologically gluttonous, hence their position in the mental triad. Riso's writings are largely why people tend to mistype Eights and Nines as Sevens now. 

**According to Claudio Naranjo:**

1. One = ESTJ
2. Two = ESFJ
3. Three = ESTx, ESTP
4. Four = INFJ, INFP
5. Five = INTP, ISxJ
6. Six = IxTP / Counterphobic Six = ENTJ
7. Seven = INxJ, INTJ
8. Eight = ESxP, ESTP
9. Nine = ISTJ, ESFJ

Narano wrote that Ones are very traditional, rigid, and imposing, which definitely suggests extroverted thinking. I agree with Twos also, but when it comes to Threes, he writes that Threes are very self-controlled, so I believe ESTJ is a better fit than ESTP. 

For Sixes, he writes that these types are very rigid and controlled, but introverted, so I suspect that INTJ fits CP 6 better than ENTJ. 

For Sevens, Naranjo made a mistake in his writing. He writes about Jung's extroverted intuitive but confuses it with introverted intuition, so while he might use the introverted intuitive as an example, he was actually referencing the ENxP, not the INxJ. Both are intuitive types, hence the confusion. 

He brings up Jung's extroverted sensor when referencing the (largely omitted) sensory orientation Eights have to life, but when comparing Threes and Eights, he writes that Threes are more likely to favor thinking while Eights aren't. 

**My own personal interpretation:**

1. One = xSTJ
2. Two = ESFx
3. Three = ExTJ
4. Four = IxFx
5. Five = IxTP
6. Six = Depends on the subtype. SP 6 = IxTP, IxFJ; SO 6 & SX 6 = IxTJ
7. Seven = ENxP
8. Eight = ESxP
9. Nine = xSxx

But this applies *generally* to the 9 types. 

It's very possible that when it comes to the 27 subtypes, there can exist exceptions, but at the end of the day, it's far more likely that a person is mistyped in one system or the other than they're some bizarre combination of Enneatype + MBTI Type."
4307,E,N,T,J,"It's a general thing, it doesn't need to be so consistent. Phobic Sixes are just more often phobic than counterphobic, and vice versa. No one is aggressive or submissive 100% of the time.

The development of both types is influenced by each other, in a way. Phobic Sixes need to learn how to trust themselves more and rely less on authorities and others, whereas counterphobic Sixes need to learn how to trust others more, and tone down their aggression and need for control or intimidation. 

I know most people like to see it as a continuum, but I don't like to, because it further perpetuates the idea that there are 2 types of Sixes (phobic or counterphobic) when there are actually 3.

The Social 6 isn't phobic or counterphobic, it's something else entirely. It's the subtype that is most left out, usually typed as a 1, or erroneously labeled as phobic or counterphobic, despite being SO, not SP or SX. Most Enneagram authors just refer to this 6 as the dutiful or Prussian 6."
4308,E,N,T,J,"Eights aren't actually this ""authority-oriented"" type everyone thinks they are, and this is yet another consequence of how the modern Enneagram made up its own definitions. 

The Enneagram is twofold; it relies not just on personal motivations, but behaviors and characteristics as well. Many people are (somewhat) familiar with the characteristics of Eights, such as toughness or invulnerability, but the only problem is:

a) These are only tip of the iceberg characteristics of Eights.

b) The larger motivations of Eights is completely omitted. 

Different types are interested in power and control for different reasons, not just CP 6 and 8. This is why depictions that try to make Eights the type that wants to ""avoid weakness"" are so incredibly flawed, because this is neither exclusive to, nor indicative of Eights.

Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that both of these types are interested in control and autonomy, but for different reasons. 

The force which influences Sixes is **fear**, and Counterphobic Sixes see power and authority as a way to ward off feelings of fear, doubt, or uncertainty. It also stems from a fear of authority, which believes that authority itself is not to be trusted. It's rigid, it's controlling, it's firm, it's cold. These individuals *direct*.

The force which influences Eights is **lust** and Eights themselves are characterized by a forceful approach to life which is used as a tool to get the things they want. It's like pushing around your weight in a room, not necessarily to intimidate anyone, but so that you get more food than anyone else, that the music is louder, and that everyone in the room can hear you. It's intense, it's overwhelming, it's inescapable, it's hot. These individuals *dominate*.

Another way to illustrate their differences is by paying close attention to their positions in the Enneagram.

Sixes are within the head triad. Counterphobic Sixes are cerebral, strategic, suspicious, skeptical; they spend a lot of time thinking about what's below the surface, or how something isn't actually what it appears to be. To an extent, Sixes spend *a lot* of time in their heads, precisely because they have such an intellectual orientation, where thinking is substituted for feeling and acting.

Eights, on the other hand, are within the gut triad. Eights are instinctive; they rely on physical, body energy, and prefer to act rather than thinking or feeling. It's a no nonsense approach that doesn't like to waste time in contemplation or consideration, it just wants to *do*.

We see this in their weaknesses: Sixes are inhibited, paranoid, and cerebral. They have to think twice before doing anything, and have a hard time trusting their instincts. Eights are impulsive, impatient, and rash; they trust their instincts quite well, and they may leap before thinking.

You may also see a difference between the two as offered by Naranjo in his 1994 book, the same book where I quoted him from:

> One difference between [Counterphobic Sixes and Eights] is the greater intellectual orientation of [Counterphobic Sixes]... which contrasts with the anti-intellectual orientation that is more frequent in [Eights]... and also the greater presence of guilt and concern for intellectual authority, as well as a measure of introversion of the former, and the greater impulsiveness and indiscipline of the latter."
4309,E,N,T,J,"The theory of a phobic/counterphobic 6 is incredibly misunderstood in Enneagram circles, and this is a consequence of a divorce between modern interpretations, and earlier models.

The Riso-Hudson Enneagram everyone uses has 18 subtypes, each subtype determined by its wing. For Sixes, you are either a 6w5 or a 6w7.

The original Enneagram had 27 subtypes, 3 per each type, each one characterized by its dominant ""instinct"" or ""drive"". Of all 9 types, the differences between the subtypes is most differentiated in Sixes, **hence why everyone knows about phobic and counterphobic Sixes but not the other 25 subtypes.**

The phobic 6 is the SP (Self-Presrvation) 6 and the counterphobic 6 is the SX (Sexual) 6. Most people think this phobic/counterphobic approach has to do ""fear"" and that counterphobic Sixes are Sixes who are afraid but *pretend* to not be afraid, but that's not it at all. 

Claudio Naranjo clarifies:

>While the \[SP 6\] offers loving obedience to parental authority and the \[SO 6\] obeys an abstract principle through legalistic or ideological obedience, **the \[SX 6\]... defends himself from the temptation to surrender just as vehemently as he is counter-phobic. He protects himself from doubt, ambiguity, and indecision through a ""true believer"" excessive certainty.**   
>  
>While the acknowledgment of a fight/flight reaction is widespread in the language of experimental psychology, **the polarity between the \[phobic\] and \[counterphobic\] varieties of \[Sixes\] correspond, rather, to a fight/surrender dichotomy** that is also present in animal life... familiar from the behavior of dogs (or wolves) who offer their throats to the aggressor as expression of subordination.  

The problem with the modern Enneagram is that because the 3 subtypes of Sixes are so varied, Sixes cannot be actually given a single, general profile that accurately captures the 3 subtypes, hence why Sixes are one of the more misunderstood types. 

The 6w5 is an amalgamation of the SX 6 and the SO 6 that doesn't actually fit either one comfortably, and the 6w7 is closer to the SP 6. What all 3 subtypes *do* have in common is the attention they give to authority figures. While the phobic (SP) 6 may prefer to have others in charge, the counterphobic (SX) 6 is the 6 that is interested in *being* in charge. Rather than submitting to authority, the counterphobic 6 wants to *become* the authority. Here is a more detailed description of this particular subtype:

>An alternative to both the soft, obedient, ingratiating style of coping with anxiety \[SP 6\] and the rigid, principled, rule-bound style \[SO 6\], we find a cluster of traits that may be understood as a pugnacious intimidation through which the individual... competes with parental authority... **and later in life uses the position of authority both to feel safe and to obtain what he wants.**   
>  
>To the extent that competitive usurpation is involved, there is guilt, fear of retaliation, and a perpetuation of paranoid insecurity. Belonging in this category are, **aside from the denouncing of authority and the competitive wish to stand in the place of authority,** ""argumentativeness,"" ""criticality,"" ""skepticism,"" and ""cynicism.""   
>  
>Along with these I have listed the descriptors ""they think they know the right way,"" ""pressuring others to conform,"" ""bombastic,"" ""bluffing,"" ""strong,"" ""courageous,"" and ""grandiose."" The trait of scapegoating appears to be related to this ""strong"" expression of type VI rather than the warm and weak style \[SP 6\]. **We are in the presence of the counter-phobic manifestation of type VI... a strategy comparable to the barking of a dog.**  

It's important to understand that **counterphobic Sixes are interested in authority** because there is a prevalent idea that Counterphobic Sixes are ""rebels"" who like to cause chaos, when again, Naranjo originally wrote that these Sixes are interested in *control* hence why he referenced the ENTJ profile when describing these Sixes:

>In the realm of test profiles I find the counter-phobic variety of ennea-type VI represented in the ENTJ.  
>  
>In Keirsey and Bates, **it is an interest in authority that dominates the picture of this personality**: ""If one word were used to capture ENTJ's style it would be commandant. The basic driving force and need of ENTJs is to lead .... ""   
>  
>They also point out that ENTJs **have a strong urge to give structure wherever they are... to harness people to distant goals.**   
>  
>""Their empirical, objective, and extraverted thinking may be highly developed; if this is the case, they use classification, generalization, summarization, adduction of evidence, and demonstration with ease.""  

TL;DR: Phobic (SP 6) is the most obedient 6 who is submissive towards authority, counterphobic (SX 6) is the most aggressive 6 who is competitive and dismissive of any other authority but themselves. The phobic/counterphobic difference isn't actually about fear, it's mostly about how these subtypes feel about authority."
4310,E,N,T,J,"There's no real way to get an answer to this. It relies on the assumption that people are able to type themselves correctly which requires both a good understanding of the theory, and a good sense of self-awareness and self-knowledge. 

Even when the theory is understood, there is no actual unified Enneagram theory. Different authors/schools may have contradicting definitions and concepts, which may lead to a person be typed differently depending on the system they use.

All that aside, my personal hunch is that types 3, 6, and 9 are the most common. All other types are less prominent. There's no hard data or anything backing this claim up though."

A lot of people tend to treat the Enneagram Institute as the ""official"" Enneagram, but it has never been that. It is only one of many interpretations of the Enneagram, and it's not even one I agree with at all.

The sooner people realize there are different Enneagram interpretations, the better."
4312,E,N,T,J,"😂 I promise it's not! I know my depiction sounds pessimistic also, but I'm BARELY scratching the surface. There is A LOT about the Enneagram and the 9 types that I could never fit into a single comment, but I've read a lot about this theory, and it's important to understand that one of the biggest fundamentals of the Enneagram is that by identifying their passion/fixation, a person can change, mature, and develop. 

Sixes being inhibited and Eights being impulsive? Those apply to the ego-types, the 6 and 8 who are stuck in the ego.

If you want to read about the development of the 9 types and the ways in which the types grow, I would recommend Sandra Maitri. You can get a better view of the Enneagram there.  [https://b-ok.cc/book/3417161/a31cff](https://b-ok.cc/book/3417161/a31cff) 

The Enneagram is like a personality system based on the 7 deadly sins. If such a system with 7 types existed, people would know it would be foolish to glorify the 7 types, because we all know the 7 sins are bad. 

Likewise, the passions were something which we're supposed to heal from, not embrace. It's why I have such a problem with authors like Don Riso, who tried to present the types in a positive light, when this only strengthens the ego."

Anyways, if you want to understand better: this isn't my personal analysis. **The Enneagram was originally about the flaws of the 9 types.** This isn't me relying on stereotypes, and this isn't me being biased, I'm telling you again:

**Eights avoid introspection, and Sixes are too introspective. One doesn't think enough, the other thinks too much. Those are their flaws.**

Behavior isn't completely sporadic or arbitrary either. 

The Enneagram types do not exist in a vacuum that is independent of behavior, and some behaviors *are* linked to specific types and subtypes, far more than the others. This is why it's important to look at motivation and behavior **equally** because motivation isn't actually *more* important than behavior, as behavior plays a huge role in a person's character.

Being an 8 is not about wanting power, control, or being aggressive. There are other types who do this also, and there is much about Eights that is left out by modern Enneagram authors, such as a sensory preference to the moment which doesn't care for depth or introspection.

Things are what they are. There's no need to fuss over it. This is how Eights operate; hence why they're in the gut triad.

No, you're not. At all. 

Eights are not actually defined by a fear of being controlled or vulnerable, as this applies to different types, and multiple subtypes. Just because you don't want to be controlled doesn't actually mean you're an Eight; there are specific qualities that must coexist with these motivations. Which takes me back to this:

>You were pointing out that someone was probably not a sexual 8 cos he described himself as mental. While this could totaly be true, jumping to conclusion from a simple behaviour description of someone you don't know is well too hasty for my taste.

Because the Enneagram is, contrary to popular belief, not just about motivations or drives. You do not need to know everything about a person to suspect something is off, and that the way the individual describes themselves **contradicts** how specific authors have described the type they claim to be. 

>To be honest I control myself and my anger most of the times and that's one of the reason I doubted being 1 instead of 8. Yet most of my impulses serve the 8's desires, not the 1's. 

This is a huge giveaway also. Here's something about Eights:

They struggle in controlling themselves. Not necessarily always, and not all of their lives, but compared to the average person? Eights are people who have a hard time *containing* their anger. It's something *very* different from what you're describing right now.

A person's type is not independent of their behavior. You said you have ""8 desires"" but what desires are you even referencing, that you think are exclusive to 8s?

> you're going from a top down perspective, where behaviour prevails over fear/desire. I go bottum/up, where fear/desire prevail over behaviour. 

No. One is not more important than the other, they must both coexist, mutually. 

I'm saying that it's not enough to *feel* like a specific type, and it's not enough to *act* like a specific type; you must be *both* to actually *be* that type. Without one or the other, you're just mistyped."
4320,E,N,T,J,"There is arguably no bigger misconception in Enneagram communities (and no more detrimental) than the idea that the Enneagram is somehow about ""motivation and not behavior"" as if the two weren't inseparable. 

Contrary to popular belief, the Enneagram isn't just about WHY we do things in the first place, it is also about HOW we do things. You cannot be a specific type just because you have that motivation, there are traits and qualities associated with the 9 types that must be factored in also. 

You cannot ignore behavior when it comes to typing someone, because a person's behavior has a **huge** role in their type."
4321,E,N,T,J,">I won't let an external authority define what and enneagram 8 should be, and what I am, because it doesn't resonate with what I know and until you find better arguments than simple quotes, I'll hold my ground.""

What are you talking about?

We all need external definitions so that we can all understand that we're referencing the same exact concepts. You cannot go up to a system with its own rules, and suddenly start to change the definitions to fit you.

If the person who actually developed the Enneagram says:

**Eights, are X, X, and X.**

And you come and say:

**Well, I'm Y, Y, and Y, but I'm an 8. I know who I am, I don't need YOU to tell me I'm not an 8.**

How does that make any sense? You're free to be whoever you want, but if you don't align with a specific definition, you're not an 8. This isn't an accusation, it's a fact.

>I'm a social 8, very introspective and intellectual

You're also an 8w7, which means that right now, you're trying to fit yourself into two different, contradicting systems.

The original Enneagram had 27 subtypes. SP, SX, SO x 9 types.

The Riso-Hudson Enneagram has 18. You are either an 8w7 or an 8w9, for example.

You cannot be both, because both authors/theories have contradicting theories that don't actually agree with each other. This is why it's important to define these things clearly in the first place, because otherwise, 9 different people are using the same label to describe themselves, despite having 9 different very characters, personalities, and motivations.

>Reducing Enneagram 8 to a non-intellectual lusty

Reducing? You're looking at this the other way around. Lust was the passion of Eights first, *then* someone came along and changed it to ""wanting power/to be in control"" which misses the mark.

>are just pure incarnation of their ego,

No, it's a reflection of the ego. It's something we identify and are capable of growing out of, it's not supposed to be something static or set in stone.

>It would also mean that 8s can't be intelligent

Did you completely ignore what I posted? I'll repeat myself:

>In these very passionate, emotional Eights there's often a detachment of the intellect—**while Sexual Eights may be very intelligent**, they express action and passion more than contemplation in the things they do.

No one is saying Eights can't be intelligent, especially not after actual development and growth takes place in the more emotional SX 8s.

>And that's the problem with defining enneagram types with behaviourism instead of deep understanding of desirs and fears.

Once again: you're looking at this the other way around.

Originally, there were specific behaviors and traits associated with the 9 types, along with influential life forces. You cannot ignore behavior, because that's what the original Enneagram relied on; not just what we want, but how we go about it, and how we do the things we do.

Two people are very angry. One is self-controlled, clutching their fists, biting their lips. They are demonstrating discipline, restraint. The other one is expressive, communicative, and letting their discontent known.

I'm only telling you their behavior, but tell me: Which one do you think is the 1, and which one do you think is the 8?"
4322,E,N,T,J,">Are you suggesting that every 1 is a preachy hardass? Every 2 a pushover? Every 3 a vapid narcissist? 

1s being preachy hardasses? Yes, naturally.

2s being pushovers? Not at all. Twos are very pushy individuals, hence their connection to 8. You must be thinking of 9s, in which case, I can also say that yes, 2s are pushy, and 9s and pushovers.

3s being vapid narcissists? Also true.

Why? Because this is how the types what were supposed to represent; the flawed personality of an individual, not the true essence. 

An individual who is a self-actualized 3 (or a 1, 2, 9, or whatever other type) that has learned to reconnect with their virtues learns to break away from these descriptions, but the Enneagram relies on understanding that, naturally, the 9 types represent the worst of us, not the good.

>and so on and so forth, but my defining drives as well as well as vices are that of an 8.

4323,E,N,T,J,">...there is a contrast to be observed between the top and the bottom of the enneagram.

>We may say that those at the bottom of the enneagram never feel good enough or satisfied enough, regard themselves a problem, and are also identified as pathological by the outside world, while type IX is a position where the individual is least likely to make a problem of himself or appear pathological to others.

>Between type IX and type IV depression proper is the common element. Ennea-type V may be regarded as depressed too, in terms of apathy and unhappiness, yet the most visible commonality between type IX and type V is that of resignation: a giving up of relationship in V, a resignation without the outer loss of relationship in IX (a resignation in participation), that gives the character its self-postponing and abnegated disposition. 

from *Character and Neurosis (1994)* by Claudio Naranjo.

I suspect that this illustration of the types is what led to the ""withdrawn"" triad, but it has created an idea that Nines are shy, introverted, or withdrawn the same way a 4 or a 5 is, when that's not at all what is meant. Naranjo wrote multiple times that unlike Fours and Fives, Nines are quite extroverted."
4324,E,N,T,J,"SP 6: 6w2, 6w4, 6w9

SO 6: 6w1, 6w3, 6w6

SX 6: 6w8"
4325,E,N,T,J,"I think you are a 7. Naranjo, when differentiating between 3s and 7s wrote:

>These may be confused in that E VII usually regard themselves vain and extroverted. **Frequently the motivation to achieve is stronger in E III, while in E VII it is tempered by a self-indulgent aversion to effort.**   
>  
>Also while E III may regard him or herself as an enjoyer, E VII is more exactly a hedonist in that the desire for pleasure exists in the context of true permissiveness and little concern for social conventions.

>More decisive still is the contrast between them in terms of discipline... **and in that of permissiveness vs. control vis-a-vis others.**  

That last sentence is especially important, because it references the ways in which Threes and Sevens handle social interactions. Sevens have a more ""live and let live"" approach, whereas Threes are more likely to get involved in the lives of others, referencing specific standards, or incorporating them into their goals. 

I'm gonna offer a few definitions also. Each type is characterized by specific qualities, a significant one being their ""passion"". The passion of a Three is vanity:

>Vanity is a passionate concern for one's image, or a passion of living for the eyes of others. **Living for appearances implies that the focus of concern is not in one's own experience, but in the anticipation or fantasy of the experience of another**, and thus the insubstantiality of the vain pursuit.  

&#x200B;

>Vanity is present especially in the ""hysteroid"" region of the enneagram (comprising ennea-types II, III, and IV), yet in... ennea-type III... **the person mobilizes herself to ""prove"" objectively her value through an active implementation of the self-image in the face of a generalized other. This leads to an energetic pursuit of achievement and good form as defined by quantitative or generally accepted standards.** 

Whereas the passion of a Seven is gluttony:

>Ennea-type VII individuals, are more than just open minded, exploratory: **their search for experience takes them, characteristically, from an insufficient here to a promising there.** 

 

>Whether in the question of food or in other realms, the gluttony of the glutton is typically not for the common, but, on the contrary, for that which is most remarkable, for the extraordinary. In line with this is **the characteristic interest in what is magical or esoteric itself, a manifestation of a broader interest in what is remote... either geographically, culturally, or at the fringes of knowledge.**   
>  
>Also, an attraction to that which is beyond the boundaries of one's own culture reflects the same displacement of values from here to there; and the same may be said of the typical anti-conventional tendencies of type VII. **In this case, the ideal may be in a utopian, futuristic, or progressive outlook rather than in existing cultural models.** 

It is important to note that while there exist 9 passions, each passion is affected by a specific instinctive drive, giving us a total of 27 subtypes, 3 per each type. In some types, the subtypes can appear to be quite different from another, as Naranjo clarifies specifically for Sevens:

>To clarify this it is necessary to point out that only the self-preservation subtype of ennea-type VII is visibly an opportunist with a keen nose for advantages; **in the social subtype self-interest is more hidden behind a friendly brotherliness,** while the sexual subtype is that of a dreamer whose interests are not of this world.  

I specifically bolded the description of the social subtype because of what you mentioned here:

>Mainly motivated by wanting to help the state of humanity and the earth. **Though I suppose there’s some ego interest in there too if I’m honest.** 

As if that ego interest is something you think you should confess, and not just something that exists. 

The fact that you mentioned ""the state of humanity and the earth"" only furthers my suspicion that you are indeed an SO 7 which Enneagram author Beatrice Chestnut has written about:

>Social Sevens avoid focusing on their own self-interest or advantage by pursuing an ideal of themselves and the world. **They sacrifice their gluttony to become a better person and to work for a better world in which there is no pain or conflict. As Naranjo explains, they defer their own desires in pursuit of an ideal.**

She also writes something which I believe would explain why (if you are a social 7) you thought perhaps that you were a 3:

>In addition to inspiring appreciation and recognition in others, **Social Sevens want to have a good image, to reduce conflicts, and to create debts in others.** However, these motivations can lead these Sevens to enter into relationships that are relatively superficial.

And finally, some excerpts which I suspect you may relate to:

>Social Sevens are very idealistic, but their idealism is a mix of illusion, good intentions, and ingenuity that function together as an “intellectual drug” that motivates action. **They’re very active, moved in an ongoing way by the ideals they want to translate into life to improve the world**, but they need their idealism to help them to activate... they invest a lot in altruism, idealism, dedication, and sacrifice to make them feel more acceptable. 

&#x200B;

>**Naranjo explains that enthusiasm, idealism, and social skills are the three pillars of the Social Seven personality. These Sevens are also visionaries: they imagine a better, freer, healthier, more peaceful world.** (New Age culture is a Social Seven culture.) **They often express excessive enthusiasm about their visions and may have fantasies of a perfect future.** They have a tendency to manipulate through enthusiasm. On the surface, they appear very joyful, and they avoid dissonance and conflict.

4326,E,N,T,J,"The terms ""phobic"" and ""counterphobic"" are significantly misunderstood and misused when referencing Sixes.

People think Sixes are either phobic or counterphobic, but there are three types of Sixes, not two. The SP 6 is the phobic 6. The SX 6 is the counterphobic 6. That's it. The SO 6 has other terms used to refer to it, such as the dutiful 6 or the prussian 6.

When people think of ""fear"" as how it applies to Sixes, they think of LITERAL fear, but that's not at all what the term is referencing; it is, instead, referencing how each subtype reacts to authority. It is not a fight/flight dichotomy but a dominate/surrender dichotomy. 

The SP 6 is compliant to personal authorities, the SO 6 is compliant to impersonal authorities, and the SX 6 wants to be the authority. Granted, this behavior may extend to fear itself, but like all the passions of the types, ""fear"" isn't meant to be taken so literally."

She has referenced this also in another article, that allegedly, Naranjo had typed Hitler as an SX 6 (as he is often typed by most people) but that in 1996, he shared that he had changed his mind, and typed Hitler as an SX 4 and not an SX 6.

I always find this interesting, especially because I've found one thing that contradicts this, which is in his 2004 book (Th*e Enneagram of Society: Healing the Soul to Heal the World*) where he brings up Hitler when speaking of Sixes.

For example, when referencing the loves associated with type 6 (submissive love and paternalistic love) he writes:

>...it is necessary in the case of the authoritarian-suspicious types that make up our EVI to differentiate between those that are too inclined towards hero worship from those who tend towards grandiosity and a heroic view of themselves. In the former case, these are highly dependent people, for whom the anxiety of choosing and insecurity with respect to their own capacities lead them to an excessive need for the father; in the latter, we are dealing with those who, in rivalry with their own fathers (at times in a mother’s body) *assume* authority and elevate themselves with respect to others in expectation of their subordination.  
>  
>While the anxiety of the former is calmed by finding protectors, **the latter are placated by feeling themselves to be powerful and obeyed—as can be seen in a caricature of Hitler.** Standing before an immense crowd, surrounded by his chiefs of staff, in a stadium in which a huge swastika can be seen, he opens his speech by saying: “I think I may say without fear of being mistaken...”  
>  
>**It is interesting to know that Hitler, who was maltreated by his father when he was a child, developed the intention to give his country a good father.** Extreme examples (such as the exaggeration of the caricature) help us to understand the greater subtleties, for the many who go through life offering themselves as fathers to those needy for authority. For one who likes giving orders, obedience is a declaration of love; to achieve obedient children, however, he will have to offer himself as a benevolent father, like the wolf in the fable dressed in sheep’s clothing

He also wrote in an earlier book that Fours and Sixes aren't easy to confuse, so whether he decided he was wrong, changed his mind, or perhaps was misunderstood, I don't know. Either way, this is important for 2 things:

1. It shows the way in which Enneagram authors and teachers disagree and contradict with each other.
2. It highlights the varieties of the 27 subtypes, showing how differentiated the subtypes of the same type can be, and that it is important to understand that there are different ways in which the types can manifest.

Most people wouldn't type Hitler as a 4 because when they think of 4s, they think of Social 4s, which is often referred to as the sad or melancholy 4. The SP 4 and the SX 4, however, continue to be obscured."
4328,E,N,T,J,"This is coming from the Enneagram Institute which,

a) doesn't actually believe in Counterphobic Sixes

I made a comment about this before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/hbllgp/comment/fv9vfr8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

What you have to understand about ""counterphobic"" Sixes is that originally, they were ONE of THREE possible subtypes for Sixes.

The only ""counterphobic"" Six is the SX 6. The ""phobic"" 6 is the SP 6. The SO 6 is the 3rd subtype, which most people are completely ignorant of. The other 24 subtypes? Those aren't even referenced. People think only Sixes come in multiple flavors, and that no other type does, when there is much that has been left out.

Rather than having 27 subtypes, the Enneagram Institute has 18 subtypes, and the closest thing to a CP 6 is the 6w5 which is described as a more independent, less friendly 6 than the the 6w7. Even then, the 6w5 is an amalgamation of the SO 6 and the SX 6 which makes it difficult for either subtype to be properly understood.

> and perhaps got a sneaky/conniving vibe? Like we are talking machiavellian level traits here.

This is far more 3 than CP 6 imo. This is far more 3 than anything else, really. You could argue that this is ""disintegration"" but that idea was also made up by the Enneagram Institute.

CP 6 is interested in direct control, in aggressive possession. The problem you'd likely face is them not taking orders (if you're their supervisor) or them abusing their authority (if they're yours). If they're your peer, they may oscillate in between, where they think they can push you around anyway. 

> What does one even do about it (other than cutting ties)? 

It depends on the context and who the individual is. Are they a family member? A coworker? A friend? Are they even a CP 6?

I'd suggest to step outside of the Enneagram for a second and to just deal with the problem by paying attention to who they are, and where you have to deal with them."

Have you read Chestnut's description of the Sexual 8? She explicitly wrote:

>As the most emotional of the Eights, the sexual subtype displays a great deal of passion that may at time gets expressed through emotions that may seem surprising to others and atypical for the other Eights. In these very passionate, emotional Eights there's often a detachment of the intellect—while Sexual Eights may be very intelligent, **they express action and passion more than contemplation in the things they do.** 

And referenced numerous times how Eights are action-oriented, physical, and active. Everyone is capable of contemplation sure, but to say Sexual 8s are introspective? That's not even close to being one of their defining qualities, at all. 

>I also see a ton of posts on this sub about this very issue of 8s getting too in their heads when they disintegrate.

This sub relies entirely on itself. It's an echo chamber where people repeat what is posted here already. There are **a lot** of mistyped people on this subreddit who will jump through loops to justify their typing. 

>8s can be introspective 

Originally? No, they weren't. Of the traits assigned to Eights, Naranjo wrote of **Sensory-motor dominance**:

>Beyond the concepts of lusst and hedonism, rebellion, punitiveness, dominance, and power-seeking, toughness, risk taking, narcissism, astuteness, is in ennea-type VII the predominance of action over intellect and feeling, **for this is the most sensory-motor of characters**.   
>  
>The characteristic orientation of ennea-type VIII to a graspable and concrete ""here and now"" (the sphere of the senses and the body-sense in particular) **is a lusty clutching at the present and an excited impatience toward memory, abstractions, anticipations, as well as a desensitization to the subtlety of aesthetic and spiritual experience.**   
>  
>Concentration on the present is not simply...but the consequence of not deeming anything real that is not tangible and an immediate stimulus to the senses.  

It's literally why Eights are in the gut triad in the first place. Because they're instinctive, they're action-oriented. 

>and with a 9 wing 

This is the Riso-Hudson Enneagram. The ""dominant wings"" wasn't something the original authors ever came up with. The interpretation Chestnut has is far closer to Naranjo (27 subtypes) than the Riso-Hudson Enneagram (18 subtypes) which completely glorifies Eights.

I already made a comment about this, on how the Enneagram Institute has a very skewed view of the types using the CP 6 and the 8 as examples: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/hbllgp/rant\_about\_this\_sub/fv9vfr8?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/hbllgp/rant_about_this_sub/fv9vfr8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>the hyper aggression and impulsivity is a stereotype. 

No, and again, this is why the modern Enneagram is so detrimental.

Eights **are** aggressive and impulsive, just as Counterphobic Sixes **are** aggressive and inhibited, because originally, **the types were not something to positively identify as.** The original Enneagram was about identifying a person's flaw, their sin, their vice, the one that determines their fake self, their ego, their personality (in contrast with the real, the enlightened, the essence). 

Saying Eights are aggressive isn't a stereotype, because that's literally how the types were depicted; by referencing their weaknesses, their worst qualities. 

The modern Enneagram tried to depict the types in the positive light, and in the end, this has just done more harm than good, because now, the original purpose of the Enneagram has been completely obscured. Now people love to brag about their types, boasting their type as if it were something to take pride in."

Everyone else has just fallen short imo, though another author which I believe comes close is one of his students, Sandra Maitri:

You'll have to do some reading, but I think it's worth it."
4332,E,N,T,J,"What description did you read?

Like I said, the modern Enneagram misrepresents the types. There's a reason I didn't link any myself."
4333,E,N,T,J,"When I say ""lust"" I don't mean ""lust"" as it used in everyday language (or as a cardinal sin) but instead, as the *passion* of Eights. The term *lust* refers to a very specific idea within the Enneagram, and I'll include a definition here:

>We must consider that lust is more than hedonism. There is in lust not only pleasure, but pleasure in asserting the satisfaction of impulses, pleasure in the forbidden and, particularly, pleasure in *fighting for pleasure*.  
>  
>In addition to pleasure proper there is here an admixture of some pain that has been transformed into pleasure: either the pain of others who are ""preyed upon"" for one's satisfaction or the pain entailed by the effort to conquer the obstacles in the way to satisfaction. It is this that makes lust a passion for intensity and not for pleasure alone. The extra intensity, the extra excitement, the ""spice,"" from instinctual satisfaction, but from a struggle and an implicit triumph.

This is what each type is characterized by, their respective passion. A passion can be thought of as a specific vice or sin, and it is one which we are supposed to identify, so that we may move away from it. 

The modern Enneagram completely misunderstands the original teachings, and now everyone thinks the Enneagram has to do with ""basic fears"" when this is an incredibly simplistic view of this system, developed by someone who didn't actually understand the Enneagram itself."
4334,E,N,T,J,"The Enneagram is not about ""core fears"" and this misunderstanding is the fault of Don Richard Riso, an Enneagram author who made up his own theories and definitions for the types. I have a strong suspicion that Riso himself was a 6, considering that he made his whole system about fears, but that's a comment for another day. 

Each type is characterized instead by a specific ""passion"" which is better understood as a vice, a sin. It's an emotional motivation which pushes us to chase after something, which is not truly unobtainable, and as such, we are forced to chase it more and more, never feeling fulfilled. 

You are right in that it sounds ""Seven"" because Eights and Sevens are very similar types, hence why their positions in the Enneagram. The passion of a Seven is *gluttony* and the passion of an Eight is *lust.* The difference between the two is that while the gluttony of a Seven is focused on *breadth* of pleasure, the lust of an Eight is focused on *intensity* of pleasure. 

In other words, Sevens want some of everything, and Eights want more of the same.

>Especially when you consider 8w9, which is less expansive to gain more and more protective of their existing territory. 

The ""dominant wing"" subtypes were also a creation of Riso, which the original Enneagram authors never taught. Originally, there were 3 subtypes, and the subtype you are referencing now sounds a lot like either the SP 8 or the SO 8. For now, I'll say SP 8 which is interested in a lust regarding their survival, material needs. 

I could continue to offer my own interpretation, but instead, I'll just offer a definition of what *lust* is, within the context of the Enneagram:

>We must consider that lust is more than hedonism. There is in lust not only pleasure, but pleasure in asserting the satisfaction of impulses, pleasure in the forbidden and, particularly, pleasure in *fighting for pleasure*.   
>  
>In addition to pleasure proper there is here an admixture of some pain that has been transformed into pleasure: either the pain of others who are ""preyed upon"" for one's satisfaction or the pain entailed by the effort to conquer the obstacles in the way to satisfaction. It is this that makes lust a passion for intensity and not for pleasure alone. The extra intensity, the extra excitement, the ""spice,"" from instinctual satisfaction, but from a struggle and an implicit triumph.  

Eights are fiery, hot, passionate, pushy, and assertive. It's not just about having control, because many types are interested in control for multiple reasons. The control that Eights want is a *dominating* control, like a lion overpowering its prey. 

That's what makes an Eight an Eight."
4335,E,N,T,J,"You do not sound like a 8, and this is a consequence of how the modern Enneagram has completely misrepresented the types, so I'll explain.  

Trying to control others is not exclusive to Eight, and exists instead within what I called the control quadrant. Ones, Threes, Sixes, and Eights are the 4 types most interested in power and control. There is a prevalent misconception that Eights are the type interested in power and control, but this misses the mark on what Eights actually want, and as a result, many individuals interested in these things tend to mistype as Eights.

>I'm analyzing EVERYTHING and trying to predict the future, then changing how I act to try to influence it. (Yes, disintegrating to 5.) 

No, this doesn't sound like Eight or disintegration to Five at all. What you're describing sounds *a lot* like **Over-alert Hyperintentionality** which is attributed to Sixes. 

I'll offer a definition by Claudio Naranjo:

>Closely related to anxiety but not identical to it is the hyper-alertness entailed by a suspicious and over-cautious disposition. Unlike the confident over-alertness of type III which orients itself to having ""everything under control"", **this is a hyper-vigilance that is on the lookout for hidden meanings, clues, and the unusual.**   
>  
>Aside from constituting a state of chronic arousal in the service of interpreting (potentially dangerous) reality, it serves an excessive deliberation concerning what for others would be a matter of spontaneous choice. I have borrowed Shapiro's word ""hyper-intentionality"" for the extraordinarily rigid and tense directedness of behavior (of \[this type\]) as well as for the exaggerated need to rely on rational choices.  

This applies to *all* Sixes, but of the three subtypes of Sixes, there is one particular subtype which is interested in strength, dominance, power, control, and authority. This subtype is the sexual Six, and is frequently referred to as the ""counterphobic"" Six.

When differentiating between this particular subtype of Sixes and Eights, Naranjo writes:

>One difference between \[Counterphobic Sixes and Eights\] is the greater intellectual orientation of \[Counterphobic Sixes\]... which contrasts with the anti-intellectual orientation that is more frequent in \[Eights\]... and also the greater presence of guilt and concern for intellectual authority, **as well as a measure of introversion of the former, and the greater impulsiveness and indiscipline of the latter.**  

Eights are lusty, physical, active, and quick to act. They don't plan, they just do. Counterphobic Sixes are cerebral, skeptical, suspicious, and vigilant. They don't do anything without calculating first. Both are aggressive, both are offensive, both want to attack. Eights suffer from not thinking before they act and being too impulsive, Counterphobic Sixes suffer from thinking too much and not acting soon enough. 

If you've delved into type dynamics, Naranjo correlated the Eight with Se, and when referencing the Counterphobic Six, specifically mentioned the ENTJ while using a description of Extraverted Thinking as an example of the way Counterphobic Sixes operate.

You say you're an INTJ, so I'll leave this here, and you're free to decide which type you relate to more."
4336,E,N,T,J,"No, it's not. I specifically said:

>contrary to popular belief, wanting control/fearing being controlled is not at all the ""main motivation"" of Eights.

So that this:

>Main motivation of 8 is to not be weak and/or seen as weak/vulnerable .

Wouldn't happen. This is a complete misconception of what Eights actually are, and like I said before, the reason why so many people mistype as Eights.

When I said a lusty, forceful orientation to life, that's what I meant. It means going after you want without hesitation, it means wanting more in life, it means expanding, being outgoing, furthering your territory, dominating the situation. It means wanting intensity, wanting more for the sake of it, and avoiding anything which impedes that; avoiding weakness is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Eights."
4337,E,N,T,J,"Politicians You Like = 8s

Politicians You Dislike = Not 8s

Real = 8s

Fake = Not 8s

?

Eights are not superheroes dude. Yes, some Eights are flawed people, they're not all champions of the people."
4338,E,N,T,J,"You have an incredibly glorified view of Eights. 

Being an 8 has nothing to do with being a protector of the weak, or anything noble like that. It has to do with a lustful, forceful, pushy way of approaching life, and contrary to popular belief, wanting control/fearing being controlled is not at all the ""main motivation"" of Eights. This is precisely why so many individuals mistype as Eights, and why I believe Eights are (surprisingly) one of the more misunderstood types. 

If wanting power and control made you an Eight, then a lot of Ones, Threes, and Sixes would be mistyped as Eights... which they often are. 

If you want to type anyone correctly, you're going to have to address your bias first."
4339,E,N,T,J,"Because the ""Enneatypes"" were never supposed to be things to positively identify with. Never. 

The Enneagram existed as a model for enlightenment, to break free from the ego, the fake self, the personality, and the enneatypes were FOR the personality, not the true self.

Modern authors have completely misunderstood that and have turned the types into 9 different classifications, with pros and cons, when the 9 enneatypes were always meant to be negative, depictions which we were supposed to grow from. 

> or am I just very insecure about embracing that side of me? 

You are supposed to *acknowledge* that side of you, but embracing it is the **last** thing you are supposed to do."
4340,E,N,T,J,Why does everyone think this guy is an ENTJ? He comes off much more like an ESTJ to me.
4341,I,N,T,J,"INTJ more rational, ISFP more judgmental."

4350,I,N,T,J,"I feel like the mental clarity that LSD gives you is due to ego death, that is, your perceptions being LESS affected (or unaffected completely) by your own preconceptions held by your ego, tinting what you analyze what you see as, to be something different than what you actually see.  

In fact, when tripping on Acid, you would see the world as if a buddhist monk, in its purest, unadulterated form, uninfluenced by your ego - caused by anxieties, pride, or embarrassment."
4351,I,N,T,J,"Just use words, sentences will confuse you.  

I think you just need to learn functions instead of saying  ""I'll stop here, everyone else should stoop to my own level of intelligence""."
4352,I,N,T,J,"I imagine Se to be akin to literally focusing in front of you and actually seeing reality instead of being AFK and thinking around in your head.  

I think it's reasonable to say that there is a mental space and a physical in-the-moment space, and higher Se means you are more in the moment, whilst lower means you are always in your head, not actually paying attention to physical stimuli."
4353,I,N,T,J,You will learn it when you practice it enough. Get started now.

Gotta get off through BDSM"
4373,I,N,T,J,"I know what you mean.  

I believe that you can 'simulate' cognitive functions that are far off in your cognitive function stack by combining two stronger functions.  

For example, you can create 'pseudo-Te' by using Ti-Se, or create 'pseudo-Fe' by using Fi-Te.  

The way, or reasons why you act in a certain manner may differ, but the end results of the actions - hence, the point of the actions in the first place - may be similar to someone using the function natively.  

As for simulating Se, I can see how you can use Ne + Si to simulate it - although I cannot say I truly understand this interaction due to not understanding Ne fully, and not having a good grasp on Si myself."

4378,I,N,T,J,You feed it psychadelics.
4379,I,N,T,J,"I find that high Fe people (top 2 function) become visibly upset when someone else, is upset or 'mad'.

4380,I,N,T,J,"Sooo all the nfs say isfp/infj, and the nts say infp.

4383,I,N,T,J,"I have multiple INFJ friends, mom and sister are INFJ, and let me tell you, they HATE organizing and keeping your ducks in a row.  

At least deep down.   

They do it out of social obligation, or future goal satisfaction reasons.  

As the 7th cognitive function in their stack, Te is their trixter function, and they both hate, avoid, and are bad at it, so it makes sense that they react in ways that attempt to avoid the things they hate."
4384,I,N,T,J,ISTP is sus.
4385,I,N,T,J,"I think no.  

Because this implies much more oft use of your extroverted functions, which are lower in the stack for introverts.  

While extroverts tend to be extroverted in general because of their two top 3 extroverted functions:  

ESTP = Se, Fe / ENTP = Ne, Fe / ESTJ = Te, Ne / ENTJ = Te, Se.  

Now, as you see, these include one's tertiary function, but not the inferior function, to which a person has great aversion to using.  

Compare this to introverts, whose top three (introverted) cognitive stacks are as follows:  

ISTP = Ti, Ni / INTP = Ti, Si / ISTJ = Si, Fi / INTJ = Ni, Fi.  

These are the functions that each person is most comfortable using, and given introverted functions do not need external input, (which is the reason why extroverts are extroverted and seeking external input) this causes them to be introverted.  

Why is this significant?  

Because I believe that there are Ti activities, there are Se activities, there are Fe activities and there are Te activities, etc etc.  

This means, that by utilizing 2 extroverted functions in your top 3 stack, you are likely to need external inputs for said extroverted functions and actively seek it out, showing extroverted behavior.  

The same for introverts using introverted functions in their top 3 stack, not needing as much (if any) extroverted function usage, especially if one is in a loop, which negates the need for external input in favor of using and abusing their 1st and 3rd cognitive function in their stack."

I learned that the only way to face your fears is by confronting them (easier said than done obviously) that translate to a 7 type of  curiosity or an 8 type of leadership when I'm in a good mental place.

Your desire to vote is  really correlated to your interest in politics and at what scale. But also to how much your vote count. I guess in the US not being a full democracy, your vote might seem less significant, I understand that you don't have so many choices in a 2-party system.

4408,I,S,T,P,"Homo sapiens sapiens aka modern humans is thought to have evolved from another homo genus 200 000 years ago.

Between those millions of years there was actually different races of homo (that includes homo neanderthalensis, homo erectus...), which were without mostly hairy bodies and with bigger brains already, enough looking human so that we mated with some. Anyway my sources are my studies in environmental and agricultural sciences where I encounter those debates and for more info I recommend you this presentation https://youtu.be/koTIBNRqMIA?t=2186 and then the one just before.

Because you can find so many dumb things that are design disasters and others that are perfectly adapted from the evolution of our bodies.

Dans la réalité les danses populaires qui visent des jeunes publics sont à la limite de l'obscène mais n'y vont pas forcément, alors que dans le film les chorégraphie sont extrêmes, ce qui fait le film ne se rapporte plus à notre réalité. On voit que le film et non plus une prise de conscience sur ce que nous normalisons au quotidien.  Les gros plans obscènes tout le long des danses auraient le méritent d'être censurés comme on censure des scènes de sexe.

Le problème n'est pas nouveau à la réalisatrice, déjà dans son court-métrage sur la polygamie (ce qui est aussi un sujet pas assez poussé dans le film) on ne sait pas si elle était pour une acceptation ou une accusation. La psychologie de ses personnages est toujours mal foutue, à les rendre psychopathes parce qu'ils font que suivre la trajectoire du film de manière abruptes. La morale  d'un réalisateur devrait se voir dans son film pas après qu'il nous l'explique. 

Cependant ça a permis de voir encore un grand puritanisme sur ces sujets des Américains, non pas par rapport aux scènes de danse vulgaires, mais sur les critiques concernant les scènes moins provocantes. Comme celle où une fille souffle un préservatif ou une autre où elles regardent du porno dans les toilettes (sans le montrer) et de là elles déballent des séries de fausses informations dignes de r/badwomenanatomy.

The personal connection to France the mainland place tho really differ from people to people even in the same Family sometimes. That being said I would say 5% want total independence or partial independence. 15% would want that but only on certain conditions.

Both can be eaten with a baguette 'cause it's delicious, and we're French.

For main dish if you have the spices, try ""Colombo de Cabri"" which is usually a goat meat curry stew but can be made with chicken too (my personal favorite is with coconut milk in the sauce too). It's served with rice and sometimes pieces of yam and sweet potato or plantain."
4419,I,S,T,P,"French creole in Guadeloupe archipelago and Martinique is part of the day-to-day life, it's standardized, can be learned in school and is on every media, not like Haiti where it is the main language (even if for a few it's more their native language than french) but even professionally if you went to be close to some people you sometimes need to use it. In business for meetings and stuff it's generally in French (except for like local businesses), but it depends on  if the people at the workplace are locals or more metropolitan but even than you could hear an expression or two.

Help with your skills humbly and get out of the ""Explorer"" syndrome, things already exist here. Rent don't buy the lands of others if you're not going to take care of it. Do a 2 months test stay, especially if you're planning to work there."
4421,I,S,T,P,"Yeah and the fact that some people here don't get is hilarious to me. My friends don't know when I 'm genuinely complimenting them because it can come off as really blunt even when that was not the intention, but they're used to it now like this one"
4422,I,S,T,P,"For friends texts, for my close family abroad voice calls. It depends on if I'll see the people often or not"
4423,I,S,T,P,"I’d like to add that the béké culture is not the same in guadeloupe since it’s not the same history ( revolution killed a lot of the big families) but we have a different kind of “white Caribbean families” that we called blancs-pays, that for us are guadeloupeans. They can be from a big industrial family (rum makers generally) and those older generations tend to hold colonialism views but the younger well it depends but are more open-minded. (Those are what some called békés). And it can also mean someone from others less privileged white families like the one in les Saintes or les Matignons in Grande-terre but there’s only a few. And add to that other whites  that came later on (I mean 50 or 30 years ago), and new metropolitan people or just some créole family that could passed white, we don’t see all whites as békés. Contrary to the Martiniquan comment below actually my white friend hate being seen as tourist and don’t used this to be more accepted to some places. That my experience. yes there is colorism but actual racists old colonialists are not as vocal as before and the few are a minority. The thing now are metropolitan people that hold this mentality that revived conflicts but there is and was generally a shift of minds."
4424,I,S,T,P,On guadeloupe archipelago since there’s multiple islands and the sleeping volcano is only in the mountainous Basse-Terre island so we more worried about aftermaths of the active one in Montserrat. Even if unlikely if there a big eruption we more prepared now than before. But actually we more scared of hurricanes and earthquakes.
4425,I,S,T,P,"I should say China but Austria was culturally really different. For example, Chinese food especially southern suited more my palate"
4426,I,S,T,P,"So the name of the Falls are ""Falls Falls"". Nice."
4427,I,S,T,P,"That's why I'm planning on buying that [https://getrocketbook.com/](https://getrocketbook.com/)

4432,I,S,T,P,"We have the same way of thinking in the Caribbean too, the ""Veillée"" (the night before the burial) we drink and eat near the open coffin it's like the last family and friends gathering, and depending on the person's funeral there is a parade with the coffin from the church to the cemetery sometimes with percussion music."

4442,I,N,F,P,Yes

4445,I,N,F,P,Happy cake day :)
4446,I,N,F,P,The outfit does suck lol but I don’t think they look bad. They look badass and surely men back then would agree when they looked at this
4447,I,N,F,P,Check out Julian Casablancas from The Strokes. That man is a falsetto king
4448,I,N,F,P,Happy cake day :)
4449,I,N,F,P,Dw it sends the same message to everyone who posts here. But yeah the examples were good enough without the word garbage lol
4450,I,N,F,P,"Seems like the music industry is “rigged”. Most of the great musicians will not have they’re time nor will they be noticed outside of their local influence. Major record labels too often look for musicians who will pay off from the attention they get and not as often look for talent. There are of course some who get recognition because they are good and deserve it but I wish people would understand that just because an artist is successful doesn’t mean their music is high quality.

This is a lot you’ve shared thanks for taking the time to type this!! :)"
4451,I,N,F,P,Nice I know 8 other than Spiderland! That’s a lot for us in comparison lol I have unusual taste. Ever heard of Sonic Youth or The Flaming Lips? You might like them since you’ve got a lot of ambience and atmosphere going on here. For Sonic Youth I’d recommend “Daydream Nation” album and Flaming Lips “The Soft Bulletin”.

4463,I,N,F,P,You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
4464,I,N,F,P,You’re right. I was guilty of this at first. Really does take more than a few tips for those who are serious. Hope more people read your comment
4465,I,N,F,P,Welcome to MBTI :)
4466,I,N,F,P,"That’s kinda cool though. Having an xNTJ looking after you and your needs only because they know some of whats good for you. I wouldn’t think it’s bossy if they care.

Sorry I know it’s just a meme couldn’t help it"
4467,I,N,F,P,There are far more intuitives on here. MBTI is the kind of thing that would appeal to them more
4468,I,N,F,P,"Those INFP and INTP responses were based on INFPs and INTPs who shared their stereotypes. They are comments, not the post but it is related to the post because each type has their stereotypes. That being said, yeah it would totally be nice to read about Sensor’s experiences!! :)"
4469,I,N,F,P,It’s a general N thing. Both Ne and Ni users will overall prefer to do things their own way but even both users have a somewhat different approach. Ni will look into the possibilities more before actually trying anything while Ne are going to go by trial and error more to experience outcomes
4470,I,N,F,P,INTJ’s are my favorite :)
4471,I,N,F,P,My guess is the meme initially had other labels but with this template they had to be blacked out. So a mistake with a black out
4472,I,N,F,P,Ah I understand. I’m very sorry for the misinterpretation there’s just a lot of “sensor bias” around here. I think you will see your friends soon and as long as you’re not looking into the news too much and making an account here is definitely a good temporary distraction from what’s happening in the world. Welcome to MBTI!! :)
4473,I,N,F,P,"Not sure if you’re joking but knowing that they are sensors, you can use this valuable piece of information to learn how to deal with them. They’re still people"
4474,I,N,F,P,F
4475,I,N,F,P,Chris really looked like Mark Zuckerberg in his music video for “Yellow”. Great song btw
4476,I,N,F,P,Wait it’s all bisexual?
4477,I,N,F,P,True. And the others are quirky ENTP x INFJ interactions as well as how they’re a golden pair. Some of those weren’t so bad. Simpler times...
4478,I,N,F,P,Great critique. Really helps with our songwriting
4479,I,N,F,P,That’s awesome!! I’m also a singer/guitarist although I play rock and haven’t managed a single original. You keep doing what you’re doing regardless of what others may tell you they prefer. The right people who like your music will come. Is there anywhere I can listen to anything you’ve done? :)
4480,I,N,F,P,"It just takes time!! :) Even if you listen to Cornell’s older stuff, he didn’t even do his mixed voice the same, most notably if you listen to the Soundgarden EP. With time he got the hang of it and became his signature tone. Just like how you just gotta give it time to develop it!! No technique or skill is achieved overnight!! I believe in you...."
4481,I,N,F,P,"Yay!! :)

What instrument do play and/or do you sing? What genre? Do you do originals? How long have you been playing? Do you feel like nowadays not as many people care about the kind of music you play as they would before genres like pop started dominating? Or is the genre you play more familiar where you’re at? And can you play Wonderwall?"
4482,I,N,F,P,This.....got excited to ask a few questions then only saw like 2 out of 20 questions answered. Guess I’ll wait a few hours
4483,I,N,F,P,I don’t know if there are any songs sung in its entirety in mixed voiced but Chris Cornell had a bunch of songs sung where the majority of it is in mixed like Show Me How To Live and Black Rain
4484,I,N,F,P,I like your new interim director already
4485,I,N,F,P,"What I like about a lot of xNTJs is that even if they may come off as harsh or arrogant they do at least give their reasons why as often as they can. I often find myself agreeing with what they have to say. As an INFP I might take it personally and I honestly do more than I’d like lol but I do admit if they have a point that I can’t argue against. Other than that, I’m probably not worth the time for xNTJs and can’t blame them. Just wish I can on a deeper level with at least one"
4486,I,N,F,P,Asking the real questions here
4487,I,N,F,P,Where are you xNTJs? I read a lot of INTJs getting tired of ppl not listening to them when they say something won’t work. I personally only met about none of you and I’d be lucky if anyone was even there to point out patterns/connections I’m not seeing to warn me
4488,I,N,F,P,Your presence may have been acknowledged in the first place before leaving which means.....maybe we do have a chance?? 0.o
4489,I,N,F,P,I am entitled to my opinion :)
4490,I,N,F,P,If you’re going be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
4491,I,N,T,P,"Well, all of those relationships ended because I was too distant/not present enough/didn't want to do it because relationships are a lot of work lol. Inferior Fe is a bitch. The two very stereotypical ENFPs I ended relatively quickly because I just can't handle the bubbly personality in that context that consistently. The two more serious ones were much more balanced and had better Ti/Te. The fact that we share the high Ne probably has a lot to do with it as well."
4492,I,N,T,P,"Interesting. I'm not sure on a few of them but most of the serious relationships I've been in have been with ENFPs, although not the stereotypical unicorns and rainbows type for the two most serious relationships."
4493,I,N,T,P,The fuck is wrong with the e's?
4494,I,N,T,P,"*Oh, I think so.*"
4495,I,N,T,P,Why do you think karens are like that?
4496,I,N,T,P,"Shit, I don't know if that was worth silver, but thanks."
4497,I,N,T,P,It says fuck the colorblind.
4498,I,N,T,P,Abraham Lincoln and Tina Fey.
4499,I,N,T,P,"Socrates was INTP, and he's one of like three people we have who wasn't a boring nerd. Don't take this from us."
4500,I,N,T,P,"Ne is a bitch sometimes. If you don't let people in on the string that got you from ""shadows move with the sun"" to ""the earth is round"" they probably won't understand."
4501,I,N,T,P,*Paw-x cable.*
4502,I,N,T,P,Lmao I just noticed your name.
4503,I,N,T,P,"I can live with that comparison because it's pretty accurate. I often have to stop explaining something and take a step back to start from the beginning of my thought process. People get (rightly) confused when I start at the end of a long debate I had with myself in my head lol. 

I have been trying to flex my Se more often. I'm great at it while working. Still have trouble in my personal life."
4504,I,N,T,P,Aw shucks...means a lot coming from an ISTP. My youngest brother is an ISTP and I have a friend that is as well. I love you guys too. I often feel like my skills are largely theoretical and abstract and you guys are all practical skill. I envy it.
4505,I,N,T,P,Thank you kind stanger.
4506,I,N,T,P,That's a thing?
4507,I,N,T,P,Gollum moive.
4508,I,N,T,P,Vomit on his shirt already.
4509,I,N,T,P,Why would you call out colorblind people like that with the font color?
4510,I,N,T,P,"The people who cry probably aren't crying because they're ""seeing colors as they should be"", but because people close to them did a nice thing for them. The people who put them on and instantly flip out are just idiots who are either playing it up for views, like you said, or because they feel they're expected to. I noticed some differences, especially with blue and purple, but mine are also sunglasses and not prescription which I need."
4511,I,N,T,P,I'm pretty sure there are two series and a manga to tell you it's a bad idea to put that on a human body. (Looks great man.)
4512,I,N,T,P,"Well I said you're a fuckin idiot, how about that?"
4513,I,N,T,P,Calculated.
4514,I,N,T,P,"Can't see the forest through the trees. Every function of your brain is a skill that needs to be practiced. I'm going to make a wild assumption and say that you spend most of your time ""in your head"". Practice being more aware of your body. The small sensations and the reactions they cause. Which muscles you use for any action. The way an action effects your breathing or heart rate."
4515,I,N,T,P,Do you really not see the answer to this question or are you just looking for someone to justify your actions?
4516,I,N,T,P,Truth of what? Who is on the high horse? I'm not great in social situations because I forget names so it's hard to follow conversations.
4517,I,N,T,P,"It's misinformed for me to make fun of the fact that I have a hard time remembering people's names? 

It's also extremely obvious where your priorities lie as well. I really hate the saying ""when you assume, you make an ass out of u and me"" but there were a lot of wild assumptions in your initial statement. 

Social ineptitude has nothing to do with remembering the identifying word a person uses for themselves. If you ever procure goods or services from somewhere you definitely interact with them and in most cases do not know their name and they definitely don't know yours. Nobody introduces themselves at the grocery store checkout.

Different people work differently. Some people can instantly remember a name, some people have drug problems, some people make pedantic comments and hang around on subreddits based around a borderline pseudo-science psychology system that they claim have no valid use. 

Some people forget people's names, some people like to troll self important teenagers and get in pointless arguments. 

I lost the plot honestly but I don't think it matters. You're a self important douche and you should have real conversations with people instead of asking baiting questions and arguing miniscule points before you point fingers at the ""socially inept""."
4518,I,N,T,P,There were a lot of mistakes for such a pedantic and haughty comment. You also forgot a period on this comment.
4519,I,N,T,P,What was your name again?
4520,I,N,T,P,"She's lying, we aren't hiding anything because there's nothing to hide."
4521,I,N,T,P,T-pose to assert dominance.

4523,I,N,T,P,"""Buy a fuckin melon and get out."""
4524,I,N,T,P,I didn't want to be an ass hole but I assumed there was something like autism lol.
4525,I,N,T,P,"You know functioning humans who can't think words to themselves and can't see anything in their mind? That's mind blowing to me, I have so many questions for them."
4526,I,N,T,P,"Ok, I thought they meant the liquid stuff and was very puzzled."
4527,I,N,T,P,Gred*
4528,I,N,T,P,"Wait, what the fuck color is immodium if not pink?"
4529,I,N,T,P,Slightly orange red.
4530,I,N,T,P,That's some bull shit. It's subject art and they told you that you did it wrong.
4531,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, I actually realized that on my own because I was thinking about how different yellow and blue are and realized it was probably the same for red and green. Verified with family and friends and my mind was blown."
4532,I,N,T,P,"I had neon pink tear away pants when I was young, that I swear to God were orange. I've never had that strange misidentification since though. Sky blue and pink or pink and gray are bad too."
4533,I,N,T,P,"Someone else asked me about peanut butter and I realized I had no fucking clue what color it was. They never answered though, so thanks for clearing that up lol."
4534,I,N,T,P,"No, red/green and blue/yellow colorblind people can still see those colors, they just look very similar or in severe cases, identical."
4535,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, I have a pair of the sunglasses, there is a noticeable difference, but I'd like to try a pair of the indoor version to see without the tint."
4536,I,N,T,P,"I think so. Thanks for bringing that thought to the front of my mind, I'm going to look into that after work."
4537,I,N,T,P,I saw one video of an artist that was colorblind using the glasses. He had a similar reaction to me though lol. It was still interesting. Part of the problem is that they're sunglasses. I'd like to get a pair of indoor prescription glasses to see if it's more noticeable.
4538,I,N,T,P,"Interesting, I wonder what the specific differences are if it's a brain problem and not a physical problem with your eyes. 

That is extremely impressive that you finished the game hahaha.

I typically see the opposite, green is usually lighter and red is darker. 

I'm glad the only permanent issue it caused is that you have trouble with red and green, permanent blindness would really suck, especially for a soccer game."
4539,I,N,T,P,It came with a bunch of balloons and none of them were super interesting. My dad had a purple cooler that looked wildly different though lol. I was very impressed with the cooler.
4540,I,N,T,P,"You're going to be disappointed lol. I have a pair and there is a video. I'm not super emotional, nor aesthetically inclined so it's just like ""oh, that looks pretty cool. I like that color."""
4541,E,N,F,P,It’s like some people are more than their stereotypes or something ;)
4542,E,N,F,P,Not existing socially *is* really where I’m at these days. My ENFP cocoon shield has been activated.

At least my dad thinks I’m funny. I’m an adult, so an average day involves my mother calling, me avoiding her until my sister yells at me and I give in. They both think I’m a failure and that I’m too old to be smoking pot. They’re probably not wrong."

I’m easily distracted, (unfortunately) I often speak over people, prone to anxiety and depression, impulsive, and latent ability to control emotions (heckin’ embarrassing). I’ve had the EQ to recognize my social inadequacy and inappropriateness for quite sometime, but the ability to control myself didn’t appear until years of (trial and error) meds and therapy.

4599,E,N,T,P,"well yes its quite obvious what his intent was, given you dont have some form of autism."
4600,E,N,T,P,"my mistake for trying to explain logic to an infp , if you do infact relate more to the istp thought process, you may be enfp"
4601,E,N,T,P,if you do have big tits i bet they are misshapen
4602,E,N,T,P,"intp arnt wovles, wolves pick up on social cues, intps dont"
4603,E,N,T,P,imagine genuinely  liking intps more than entp lmao
4604,E,N,T,P,"thank you, i fixed it"
4605,E,N,T,P,"What im saying is that as an entp, you (fe-si) quite often, the same way we (ne-ti) constantly. In my opinion esfj and entp arnt so different. The ideas that surround sensors are so stupid..not attacking you, just the community as a whole. I see esfjs as feeling entps, and i see entps as thinking esfj. Im entp, and people have also called me nice and such. I think we just like to help people is all, and use our creativeness to get people unstuck."
4606,E,N,T,P,"you prob just (fe-Si) alot, which means your more like an esfj. Idk why you say enfj"
4607,E,N,T,P,ni-te is easy to imagine ...ni-fe..no so much? i suppose ni-te are patterns presented objectively and ni-fe is patterns presented pleasantly.
4608,E,N,T,P,i just think the subconscious of each type looks very different
4609,E,N,T,P,"I think things are best described simply, if a child cant understand it, its too complicated. Elaboration is good, but a vague or lengthy definition is often counter-productive"
4610,E,N,T,P,i think it fails to explain what is going on with Ni. Alot comes from the subconscious.
4611,E,N,T,P,"pattern intelligence, what narrative is this?"
4612,E,N,T,P,"Yeah young kids can be hard to type, especially if introverted, but a good ear can type some kids. 

Im sure you realize just how introspective isfps can be. Really seams like they allow themselves to feel life with an intensity of emotions. I respect this, but thats a very distracting place for me as an entp to be. I do think that entps and isfps process the world similarly, despite what the community may think. I think both types along with intj and esfj all use (fi-se), (Ne-ti), (ni-Te), and (Fe-Si). 

So i think all these types process their emotions the same way, but its the isfp who dares to always be processing these emotions. i think (fi-se) ask the question, What am i feeling? how does that affect what i know?

i notice isfps falling deep into their own feelings, with a great degree of acceptance. People can call them all sorts of things for this fact alone, especially if male, but i think it respectable. its not always easy to be so honest with ones self. 

Like i said earlier all fi users benefit from clear articulation. but isfps will be fed best though a (ni-te) response. ""What narrative is happening here and what can factually be said about  it?"""
4613,E,N,T,P,im good they'res no point
4614,E,N,T,P,infps or isfps?
4615,E,N,T,P,"They are a strange mix of passive and passionate, it can be hard to deal with. They can also seemingly be oblivious to others feelings. If its true, i dont know, but its the impression many give off, of simply not picking up on subtle human expressions. But when they are spoken to in a direct manner(something infjs struggle with?), things click for them. Despite being emotional people themselves, they dont seam to react well to high forms of expression at times . ""This is what i feel, This is Why, This is how it makes me act.""  is the kind of approach i would take. consider them feeling type estjs if this makes something click in your head, the same way youre the feeling version of a istp."
4616,E,N,T,P,"Have you considered entj? I find entj and intp to be fairly similar, But if you really want a accurate typing we should just talk some time. PM me anytime, facts are nice, but seeing how you naturally communicate gives way more insight than any online test can. Youll find i can talk about almost anything, so dont hesitate :)"
4617,E,N,T,P,"According to my own personal model, the relationship between infj and istp ( or what i call the natural advocate and the logical performer) is what i call i depressant/calming  relationship. Yall share a very similar style of communication, and this similarity is calming  in nature. His heavy use of (TI-Se) feeds your (NI-FE) and vice versa. Now the relationship that you have with enfp/ the musing introspective is what i call a transformative relationship. These people can stretch you like no one else, but they too share a similar or at least understandable style of communication to you. I call them transformative, because when we come into contact with our opposite, we are challenged by their very presence. But as nature shows us, where their is struggle, their is growth. These types when we manage to harmonize with them, synchronize with us very very well. I am nothing like my intj (natural director) partner, with whom i share this transformative relationship with. But yet we come to common conclusions?  It really is like male and female. Opposites, yet complimentary. It is conventional wisdom, that the harder the endeavor is , the bigger the reward. Well this is very true for transformative relationships. Its hard to get into place, but once in place, their is so much both sides have to offer."
4618,E,N,T,P,"Infps are distracted istjs.

infp = (fi-ne)(si-te)//(fe-ni)(se-ti)

istj = (si-te)(fi-ne)//(se-ti)(fe-ni)

I dont follow mbtis logic to closely, i have my own system called personality expression types system (PETS) that iv been working on for 3 years or so, it has all the same 16 types, but takes into account that all types use the 8 functions. I think its silly to assume we dont use all 8 intelligence, regardless of type. 

but lets analyse the relationship between infps and istjs.

According to my system these types sit in the same quadrant, along with enfj and estp. This quadrant in the meantime has been named the moral moving quadrant, essentially people in society who keep it in motion of what it means to be good and evil. 

the names my system gives these types are as follows.

infp = introspective muse 

istj = evocative director 

enfj = advocating naturalist 

estp = preforming logician 

you might ask why all 4 of these types are in the same quadrant?

well they share all the same 4 operations.

what are operations according to my system? 

simple, its just they pairs of functions. as in 

(ne-ti),(se-fi),(fi-ne),(ti-se),ect....

an introverted functions always needs a extroverted function

a judging function always need a perceiving  function 

these two laws come together, to form operations.  

The operations your quadrant all share are as follows 

(fi-ne) How am i feeling, what possibilities can arise out of all these feelings? 

(si-Te) What is being evoked here? What can i do about it? 

(Fe-Ni) What is everyone around me feeling? What narrative is this creating? 

(Se-ti) What is happening in the immediate environment? What logical conclusions can be drawn out of it? 

Going off of this we can see that introspective muses(infps), and evocative directors(istjs) have very similar mindsets, where they are both very good users of the operations (fi-ne), and (si-te) 

I would say, they nearly fill the same social role, being in the same quadrant and sharing similar intelligence. 

The only real distinction is that one is a feeler, meaning they ask Why before What.

Where the other is a thinker, meaning they ask What before Why. 

Common introspective muse thought process goes as follows:

How am i feeling and what possibilities are arising out of this? What is that evoking, and how can i make that happen? ok so ive made it happen.. What are people feeling, what sort of narrative is this? What are the physical implications of this? what can logically be said about this? What am i feeling..repeat. 

Common evocative director thought process goes as follows:

What is this or that evoking in me, and how can i make it happen? how would that make me feel? what possibilities  arise out of those feelings? ok so ive made it happen..What are the physical implications of this? what can logically be said about this? What are people feeling about this? what narrative is this? What is this evoking in me?... repeat 

&#x200B;

You claim to be infp and to be like istp but you would be more like an estp. 

if you want help typing yourself, feel free to pm me :)"
4619,E,N,T,P,"I want to say enfp, because youre so focused on these objective facts you got from all these test. But we can talk anytime if you want a more accurate testing. And about Bi-Polar, its a really strange phenomenon, as someone who has a family history, and one manic episode with severe disillusion (honestly a fun time lmao). I can tell you its a very manageable thing. Remember, mental illness is often a state of mind, not a life long condition. We walk into these states of mind, and we can walk out, and we can walk away from them, and all together avoid them. Mental health is poorly managed by western society in my opinion, and id like to also discuss this if your interested. PM me any time :)"
4620,E,N,T,P,"you must understand functions are used in pairs ..when calming yourself are you more like an esfj (fe-si) or more like an isfj (si-fe). Through my own personal analysis and studying iv found that as an entp, to be like an esfj is calming to me. Being directly helpful to the needs of others, where the isfj may be a bit more passive and keeping maintenance with Si leading (si-fe). Where i want to be in people face, passively listening to what they might need. Only when i know do i go into action. Do not mistake your need for the spot light as a sign of being (ne-ti). I know intps that would just love the time to talk about their interest and such. Your attitude with Fe seams very intp. Many of the intps i know just ignore social norms to the point that it even astonishes me as a some time loud and controversial entp. Their is bold, and than their is oblivious, and thats exactly how id describe intps...a bit oblivious. Entps will not care for the facts and logical frameworks of things as heavily as intps, its really a second thought when they are first and foremost thinking of possibilities. You see through the humoring of possibilities, entps come to logical conclusions. We wonder into the truth.  Through the construction of logical frameworks, intps open up new possibilities to them selves and take them. Intps work into freedom of choice. Which sounds more like you? Im fairly good at typing people, but you must understand its impossible to type someone accurately through one post. Hit me up any time :)"
4621,E,N,T,P,"Sounds like an intp approach to creativity. Still methodical but adaptive and inventive. ""However, the main goal is to understand the logical framework for a system of knowledge"" this statement tells me you are more Ti focused than Ne focused...you go on to say ""and then through that step, i can use my creative side to experiment based on that framework"" now we see you deploying Ne. This statement and way of being is very Ti-Ne to me. Where when i approach the piano, i simply explore all the sounds, come to my own scales, and chords inside them and throw lyrics onto them. Through my Ne efforts Ti explanations arrive, Through your Ti finding, Ne possibilities arrive. I cannot say with out knowing you, what type you are, but through your actions alone, you seam more intp. As an entp i find it very hard to study conventional knowledge, because it simply drains my Ne. I might simply look up, what make good music, what are some basic techniques, how can i sing better, and such. I have tried to learn music theory, but its very little help. Im much happier to just jump onto an instrument and make it erupt with new possibilities. My Ti is in the back telling me ""oh that sounds nice"", or ""oh thats a pretty sour melody"". By the end if i can remember what i was doing, I have a ti understanding of what good music is to me. I rambled a bit, but i hope you get my point"
4622,E,N,T,P,À as ààarweeee was wondering a

4630,E,N,T,P,"Laughing my big black ass off 😂😂😂 infps and enfps are also executive's ..they know nothing of personal (Ti) logic...they let what all executive's do ..they let others handle the logistics ..but instead of yelling at you the way estjs do, they just cry to get you to think for them."
4631,E,N,T,P,Ah ..yes ..well if you have questions I'll try to answer them ..so let's just start over ..now that I know English isn't your native tongue
4632,E,N,T,P,Idk I think my erradic punctuation and communication style just sets me up for failure when talking to you guys ...what exactly are you confused about?

I'm not saying they shouldn't be. The same way it's okay for me to be bitchy and petty. But to sum it up, it's because they lead with Fi. Which is obviously all about ""my feelings"". Left and right they can't help but spout their own feelings. It's a very common trend where k will just straight disagree with an infp, and they can't handle it, and they start to act as if they have something to prove. That's fine, but I can't be expected to care. Why do I like isfps over infps ..very simple answer ..me and isfps both understand and use (Fi-Se) ...the infp uses (Fi-Ne) which looks something like ""how do I feel and how can I project out onto the metaphysical world"" ..this naturally competes with my (Ne-Ti) ""what's going on out here in the metaphysical world, and what can logically be said about it"" ..Fi and Ti often disagree and fight alot ..but not only do we have that going for us ..we are both using Ne ..which means we are going to compete over the metaphysical landscape ...because of my high Fe I can see these guys as insensitive and uncaring, which may be true in alot of cases ..and because they have a high use of Te..they see my bitching as pointless, and overly emotional."
4636,E,N,T,P,This isn't about debate but okay ..a closed mind is a sick mind ..it might explain a few things in your past
4637,E,N,T,P,You're starting to sound like you have something to prove...like maybe you want to argue?
4638,E,N,T,P,An infp would think that ..tell me ..am I stupid for thinking that? Or am I just making an observation you disagree with? Why do I think those things? Often people don't prod me for saying these things ..I also have half a bottle of wine in me rn..I'm not making excuses ofcourse..just painting you a picture
4639,E,N,T,P,We like to speak our minds that's all

After some time I realized that probably I can read people better than I think and before I was thinking, you can't judge people by their appearance. But now, I think I can read people, I usually know what people I'm gonna get along with, and I follow my intuition better now."
4692,I,N,T,P,I think a realistic INTP would never achieve to be a scientist because it's too much work and effort. Maybe INTP-A. But definitely not an INTP-T. I'm an INTP-T. I've been good at science and I loved technology. I don't know why I ended up doing communications degree and my brain is too logical to do that. And now I'm fucked up. So I'm lost in life lol
4693,I,N,T,P,"I think it doesn't work like that. In Europe housing is really expensive. It doesn't matter if it's a shitty city, the house prices are really expensive... You can't save money because you spend every penny on expenses, taxes, food, transportation (which can be really expensive too)... So basically you can't safe money but you still live in a shitty city."
4694,I,N,T,P,"I don't know. Usually the people that most get me and understand me are Scorpios, maybe because of my 3rd house in Scorpio and stellium in 8th house... 
I feel like they understand my depth and I understand their depth. It depends on the Scorpio but If they're advanced and not toxic, they're amazing. I also drawn in my emotions... I feel like they invade me and I need time to rest to deal with my emotions. I also need alone time and even feel like I'm hiding somewhere so that I feel safe... 
I've met many fire signs and they're usually pretty much positive... Like, when I get sad I literally fall from where I am and I become depressed and I enter into the darkness, into hell... Then I need some time to come out lol. But I feel like fire and air signs don't have this. They recover easily and they feel less pain because they're not sensitive. For example, I feel like aquarius or Leos or sags are not sensitive at all... I'm hypersensitive... a sensitive person can't be rough with their words or can't get along with everyone... And Leos and air signs or sags usually get along with everyone."
4695,I,N,T,P,"I feel like people complain so much about shit I don't find that sad. I went through a lot of shit and I only empathize with things I went through... I can't empathize with you complaining about your boyfriend, or about romantic stuff. I freaking hate it. They're lucky to even have a romantic partner so I can't empathize with them lol... There are many energetical vampires. So I don't let people complain with me nor tell me their problems. I'm too good for them, I don't fake my emotions, but they do. They can talk for 4 hours and complain and cry and shit and you give them all your energy and then they feel great and you feel tired and empty. I don't give my shoulder easily like that. I'm not no one's therapist. If people have problems I always advise them to go to a therapist. I don't want to be their shoulder to cry on..."
4696,I,N,T,P,"I don't know if you know MBTI but I'm an INTP, Aries sun Virgo rising Libra moon, aries mercury. I'm intuitive. But I'm not a feeler. I don't like dealing with people's emotions, though I'm really empathetic so I don't know how to explain that. I just don't empathize with some people because I find them fake. But I'm much more deeper than other fire or air signs I know. Maybe it's because I have stellium in 8th house. I don't get along with superficial people like some Leos, sags, libras, etc."
4697,I,N,T,P,I'm a really sensitive aries. I have Libra moon and virgo Rising. But I'm quite sensitive myself. I hate it when some Aries are just really selfish and childish and don't give a shit about people's feelings but then you say something to them and they get offended. Don't say shit if you're not gonna be able to take the response... Also they're too stubborn and egocentric. Mostly Aries men. They're just DUMB sometimes hahaha... I guess my Virgo rising and my Libra moon kind of hate aries traits lol

4700,I,N,T,P,"Yeah it's true. The boys I like usually date girls that are quite submissive and really cute, submissive way cute. Like, a lot of them couldn't live without a man. And then I think, Should I be a submissive bitch so guys will date me?? And I don't want to be a woman like that. There are many women out there that have suffered a lot because of their submissive attitude and I don't want to be like that."
4701,I,N,T,P,Yeah wtf. Why would anyone be intimidated??
4702,I,N,T,P,"Lol but he can't win an Emmy because he didn't play anything amazing or weird, he doesn't have incredible acting skills, and also he's just playing a normal character. It's not like a series about killers or The Big Bang theory where they do more acting or something... Ted's character is really basic... The end ruined everything. They didn't need a happy ending but definetly the show was a comedy show and they can't turn in into a tragedy in 40 minutes of the last episode."
4703,I,N,T,P,"Well you know the camera is not really about megapixels but colors, lense distortion... Etc. Chinese phones usually suck at cameras and mostly at selfie cameras... Samsung even though not being Chinese I think it takes shitty pics to people. I think Oppo is probably the best one in those prices."
4704,I,N,T,P,It looks like the 4a. It doesn't look premium at all. I'd buy the 4a before the 5.

4706,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. 

-Fellow INTP haha"
4707,I,N,T,P,"I feel identified with this. As an INTP, what if the mother is an abuser, a narcissist, a terrible mother, she treats her children like shit? We only see one part and it's the agression of the child. But what is the reason? Why would a child be agressive to their parents without a reason??? 
I would not act. And If I acted I would call child services actually."
4708,I,N,T,P,Hahaha as a Boss I would fire him. We don't talk about family at work. Hahaha
4709,I,N,T,P,"Yep. THEY CHOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN. But when you're poor and childfree, you're not choosing that..."
4710,I,N,T,P,"Yeah... When they say thrift shopping is cheaper and you buy real brands... I mean, the prices are the same or even higher to new clothes now. I don't live in the US but elsewhere anywhere it's like that. I don't see buying used clothes if they're gonna be as expensive as new ones."
4711,I,N,T,P,"I think for example Robin in How I met your mother had a great ending. She stayed loyal to her character. I mean, she couldn't have children though and SPOILER:
I hated the end of How I met your mother because Ted gets married and achieves his objective: Getting married and having children. 
SPOILER ALERT: 
The mom dies, and after maybe 40 years??? HE GOES BACK TO ROBIN AGAIN. I find it INCREDIBLY SELFISH from Ted. He just was in love with Robin ALL THE TIME. Even married. And as she couldn't have children, he thought she wasn't the one. But after his wife dying... He gets back to her. THAT'S THE WORST BETRAYAL IN THE WORLD..."
4712,I,N,T,P,"Yep. They never give interesting characters to women. I liked the character of Jodie Foster in the silence of the lambs... She's strong and powerful and a great female character. In the second movie though, Jodie didn't want to play because she falls in love with Hannibal, he escapes or something and they fall for each other. Jodie thought that the character would never do that. See?? It's the same shit always with female characters. They always fuck it up because they romanticize or make women clingy and stupid."
4713,I,N,T,P,"But she ended up doing exactly that, but with the difference that he was a vampire and he had sexual needs towards her blood Lmao it's such a stupid movie hahaha"
4714,I,N,T,P,Well the whole movie was too clingy. And then when the wolf guy did an IMPRENTATION or some shit in the little girl... PEDOPHILIA???? LOL
4715,I,N,T,P,Oh no. I don't want to achieve my 30s. Ever. I'm afraid of this. I'm usually not very social anyways but honestly I don't want to just suddenly meet new people and have to talk to them about children. It's like a nightmare. I guess we need to make groups for child free friendships...
4716,I,N,T,P,"Yes. Now they are advertising the iPhone 12 like the ONLY PHONE THAT HAS 5G. It's annoying. It's almost FRAUD or false advertising. If you listen carefully they have an advertising like: WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS. And it's straight up a lie. They're never the ones that do something first, maybe sometimes, but not always. Only phone with 5g?? What about the only phone that doesn't have a faster screen for nowadays technology while the price is 50% higher? 
Oh and also it's so funny in their ads they say: CALLING, MESSAGING, DOING THIS OR THAT, CLOUD... 
Apple, ANY PHONE CAN DO THOSE THINGS. Only the people that don't know about technology think Apple is a genius inventor."
4717,I,N,T,P,"In Europe is more of the same. Minimum wage 900-1000 Euros. One room in a shared appartement in a city: 600 Euros. So basically you just have 300 Euros for transport, food, expenses...

4718,I,N,T,P,"Uhmn thanks. Yes, I actually MAY have depression. But I know I won't be able to solve my depression because it comes from a problem. As I can't solve that problem because it's physical, I guess I get bitter because I see everything with a negative view... 
I don't think anyone cares about me and I don't think I have to care about anyone either because it only brings pain."
4719,I,N,T,P,"No, I didn't say that. I said that to me, everyone is the same. Every human being is the same and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter the culture because human beings think the same way and act the same way even though being in different countries."
4720,I,N,T,P,I don't think this is unpopular. Just go and look at Instagram. All those fitness girls are hot. They have millions of followers. They have the same opinion as you
4721,I,N,T,P,"I agree. But at the same time, you stay with a bittersweet sensation after watching the movie. I think that sometimes we need that Happy ending. Even though we know in real life it's not like that, that's why it's a movie. It's not real.  I love tragedy ending movies though. Yeah it would be great if just they all ended miserably. Lmao imagine Friends ending like shit. 
I remember I hated the ending of How I met your mother because it was too bittersweet..."
4722,I,N,T,P,My father is a cancer. I don't understand him. I'm an aries. We're completely different. He's negative and really passive. Also he's so weird. I don't know. He's a mysterious man. I'll never understand him.
4723,I,N,T,P,"I'm an aries and I always get along with scorps I don't know how, my friends were always Scorpios. They understand me the best. And they get me the most. Maybe it's because I have my 3rd house in Scorpio and an aries stellium un 8th house."

4729,I,N,T,P,I'm skinny but I don't have a tiny waist. Skinny women usually are supposed to have more of a rectangular shape. You will never achieve a hourglass figure. Really few women are born with that figure. And if you're tall it's almost impossible you'll have that figure. But whatever. They work out a lot to get those waists I guess.
4730,I,N,T,P,"Obviously insecure women are the ones that most buy shit to look better. Look at how much we waste for beauty: skin care routine, makeup, clothes, hairstyler, hair products, gym, healthy food, supplements... Etc. Everything to look  beautiful. And also women compete between each other all the time. They're jealous and envious of each other a lot of times... That competition makes us want to achieve perfectionism..."
4731,I,N,T,P,They're the responsible of that. No one forces them to edit their pics. They're obsessed with competition and competing between each other. Instagram is like a magazine of girls that promote themselves...
4732,I,N,T,P,A naturally skinny woman doesn't have much curves. Now it looks like girls are skinny and also have slim waists like a needle. It's not usual. But it looks like it's so common because of Instagram
4733,I,N,T,P,What does gen Ed mean?
4734,I,N,T,P,"I agree. Most people I know that study science, they just repeat everything they've studied but can't think of themselves nor have their own opinion. That's exactly the opposite of scientific brain..."

4737,I,N,T,P,Lol science and philosophy go by hand... Those questions asked by philosophy are exactly the ones science tries to answer...

4772,E,N,F,P,"I was thinking about your comment again and realized that this is really depressing imo. You know, knowing that he's thankful is cool, but often isn't enough to feel satisfied after eg complementing them. The only thing we want is being appreciated. Everything that's more than an honest ""thanks"" will make our day. Now like you said the INTJ will most likely keep his feelings for himself so we won't notice if he's pleased or annoyed or anything. If we don't get positive feedback, we will stop pleasing the person eventually (cause we think he could be annoyed by us and/or we don't want to invest our energy anymore). That's why I'm only vibin really hard with my INTJ friend when I'm in an unshatterable mood. When I'm in a neutral/bad mood I want to get out of there ASAP. Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood or sad he asks me what's going on and that's really uplifting cause he doesn't do that to many people :).

Summary: You would have so much power over other people's feelings if you expressed your own feelings more c:"

4774,E,N,F,P,Why are you so damn wholesome to read xd
4775,E,N,F,P,Agree
4776,E,N,F,P,I think I've never seen a moody INTJ tbh. At least the ones I know get pissed when in a bad mood and make the most random and funny jokes on a good mood :D. I think they're more likely to be INFJ because of their interest in psychology and giving guidance.
4777,E,N,F,P,"I actually agree with what you mean. At least on a stereotypical level (not every INTJ is the same obviously). If my INTJ friend was just a bit more thankful for little things people around him do for him and not that judging I bet he would be way more likeable (I already love him tho).
One being emotional af and INTJ criticizing too much can be the most stressful thing (at least for me, but I guess for many others as well)

4798,I,N,F,P,"the criticism is that sticks can be used for long term fire. You can pile 20 sticks onto a fire instantly and get 2+ hours of burn time. And with no struggle in gathering them, it's basically free resources without any risk in obtaining them. 

I'd like to add that using big thick logs to start fires (and at level 3 without tinder) is not only extremely unrealistic but also immersion breaking. You shouldn't be able to start fires with 'big wood' and you shouldn't be able to keep fires going hot with 'little wood'"
4799,I,N,F,P,"I agree. 20 sticks can get you over 2 hours of fire. I think the burn time of sticks should be reduced to 2 minutes instead of 8 minutes. Sticks should be something you grab for some quick fire, as opposed to hour long blazes. 

But imo the entire fire system should be revamped."

4806,I,N,F,P,"Close in the sense that we are running parallel. 

OP does not hate their job. They just hate working 40 hours. You offer a solution that involves maintaining that and I offer a solution that changes it. Arguing which is better is quite subjective. But my opinion is that changing the status quo about work hours would solve the issue entirely for a lot of people. While simply trying ways to deal with the frequency of work isn't a surefire way of solving the problem for them. 

People are free to do what they want. Wanna keep working 40 hours? Go ahead. Wanna work 60? Be my guest. But in my opinion there shouldn't be a stigma to wanting less than the average, the ""normal amount"". And we shouldn't be telling people to learn to live with it because not everybody is built the same. And not everybody is a ""go person"" like yourself. Some people are slower, they like less, a lot like me. Everyone is free to tackle life the way they want. That goes every way. We shouldn't be constrained."
4807,I,N,F,P,"I was using that as an analogy. It's got nothing to do with race at all. It seems it went over your head. I'm saying that telling someone to live with the current system they dislike just because it's better than what they previously had is LIKE telling someone affected by racism that current racial tensions is better than slavery EVEN if they aren't actually adequate. I was using this scenario as an example of what you're saying. That an 'it's just the way it is' attitude isn't always the greatest one to have. I don't actually care about the use of the word privilege here. 

The status quo does make us feel like our jobs and everything about us isn't good enough AND (you forgot to add) that we should be striving for more and more and more to solve this feeling. You hear people say ""just get another job, just work harder, suck it up"". But we fail to see that the reason we feel this way is because of the jobs themselves. You can't fight fire with fire. Working more isn't going to fix the feeling of dread you get from working at all. And I do agree with you in giving OP methods to cope with the current way of living. BUT coping mechanisms aren't through and through solutions (in some cases the solutions hurt more than coping with them but that's besides the point). A potential solution to this problem isn't saying ""well the hours suck but it's how it is, here's some ways to deal with it"" because DEALING WITH IT IS THE PROBLEM! That's my whole take on this. No amount of coping with working 40 hours is going to get rid of feeling dread from it. It's like fighting the symptoms when you should be fighting the disease. 

A potential solution I propose is to change the social perspective on working less hours than 40. As opposed to telling people to accept it OR work even more. Sure people can get by on the usual 40 but if we can strive for better then why not do it? 

I seem to get a lot of flak for my ideas, I guess they are that controversial...

If one wishes to express the concept of language they simply say something like ""What do you speak?"" or ""What forms/ways do you speak?"" This is because the speakers value absolute oneness of humanity, and separate languages just like cultures and nations are ways of dividing humanity up into groups, despite other languages and cultures being an important part of human nature."

4811,I,N,F,P,"I never really go into that phase of mind. Does anybody know what the ISTP side of the INFP is like?

Now people tell the working class to appreciate what they have since it used to be worse. And the very concept of it being better is shunned by society. Why? Because it's against the status quo and people don't like their preconceived notions of what life should be like being shattered. Just because something is the way it is doesn't mean it has to stay that way. Doesn't mean it can't change."

""Täkkarðú mírða?"" 

/ta:k:arðʏ mirða/

    talk.PRES-2PS 1PS.LAT

*Talk-you me-to?*

But personally I find /arð/ and /irð/ difficult to pronounce so you can easily just drop the conjugated verb ""täkkar"" and force it into the infinite ""täkka"" and then throw on the pronoun to get **täkkaðú.** Do the same with ""mírða"" to get **míða** which is just the nomative first person singular. So then you get

**täkkaðú míða?** 

Which I find much easier to pronounce. Only difference is that the lative case isn't applied to ""me"" so it just becomes ""I"". it's not the same direct translation but the meaning is still there. 

*Talk-you I?* 

It's not at all proper way of speaking but the speakers of the language aren't professional either. They're very free form so they don't care about being consistent with little things. As long as the meaning gets across."

4887,I,N,T,J,"Dude it's just very fun, this sub has much more energy than my own sub. Not to say I don't like r/INTJ, I love our personality type as well but the thing is, ENTJs are so motivated and passionate and strong (in their self expression) that it motivates me somehow haha"
4888,I,N,T,J,"My reason is mainly the energy ENTJs seem to possess which is my cup of tea. I use Te pretty strongly and in general click with this personality type a lot, so I like being here. Many things my own sub won't express which this sub does!"
4889,I,N,T,J,"Well whenever I see a post that has to do with entj, it's very much about productivity and a majority of people showing how passionate and serious they are about what they do [INTJ sub is less about passion so it can be a bit dry] Their self expression sometimes may be a bit stronger than the norm and that's zesty imo, I like it a lot"

One more thing just because someone tends to be a certain way doesn't mean they are incapable of being any different an introvert can be outgoing sometimes and extroverts can reflect on themselves all the time. We always brag about how introspective we are how about we put that introspection to good use and reflect on the way we have been talking about others.

4959,E,N,T,J,"Yes. Equally important to differentiate it from MBTI is its passivity and inertia. They often ""go with the flow"" and tend to be much more lazy and relaxed than the MBTI INJs. Helps to think of them as closer to the INP types, the only reason this changed in the MBTI is because Myers severely misiterpreted Jung at several stages."

None of what you know as ""cognitive functions"" has their origins in Jung, they have their origins in Myers' dichotomies and her own misinterpretations of Jung. They are simply an attempt to retcon Jung in a completely separate system, and were never used or meant to be used in practice. Read Psychological Types"

4969,E,N,T,J,you are thick in the head
4970,E,N,T,J,Jack Aaron (head of WSS) claims himself INTP ILI is much more common and likely than LII
4971,E,N,T,J,"The idea that there is any overlap between MBTI INTP and Socionics LII only holds up if one isolates theory from practical and recognized application, with no mind of how the system even came to be. The MBTI does not use cognitive function systems, and where at one point it was mentioned in theory, this was Myers' attempt to retcon Jung into her own system by completely misinterpreting and butchering Psychological Types to fit her own already somewhat established letter dichotomies, and the subsequent corruption from many a failed psychologist to make it fit ""their experience"" and ""what makes sense to them"".

This is how for example Jung's detached, unorganized, artistically abstract and present-oriented Introverted Sensation Type (in Socionics, SxI; in MBTI, ISP) became conflated with the almost autistic, literal, past-oriented and traditional ""SJs"" (LSE); Jung's hard-nosed, stubborn and resolute Introverted Thinker (LxI, ITJ) became the dreamy, scattered and weak-willed INTP (ILI); his dreamy, scattered and weak-willed Introverted Intuitive became the all-powerful Godlike pulling-society's-strings NJs etc. 

This is also why Socionics properly translates the older system: it is centered in unbiased observation, much like the MBTI's dichotomous system. To use the ""cognitive function"" system and refer to it as MBTI is like stripping a house of its foundation because you ""don't like the way it looks"", sure it might look better and give you more space but a single gust of wind and the whole thing crashes down.

&#x200B;

You are educated on Socionics and are open to this information, but I have to ask: Why continue using a faulty system? The MBTI is nothing but a test, any claims of a deeper underlying theory that also somehow can be used separately are painfully uninformed and disproven (see Reynierse's ""The Case against Type Dynamics""), and you understand that any stereotypes you might use originate on online forums which are dedicated more to roleplaying fantasy personas than actually gaining an understanding of the theory.

The fact you may aesthetically value this system doesn't mean it's right by any means, forum self-typings tend to be wrong, and to say that an online self-typed INTP is more likely to self-type Socionics LII is intellectually dishonest. In MY experience, I know a group of people very educated on typology, every self-typed INTJ self-types LII, every self-typed INTP self-types ILI. Yet this experience is completely ungrounded in actual theory (though in my case it would actually support it).

&#x200B;

Not to say that ""INTP LII"" or ""INTJ ILI"" are completely impossible; INTJ SLE, however, is. Even the stereotype of ""quiet, dark, calmly confident strategist"" is much more fitting of LSI than SLE."

This, The California Civil Rights Act, is a piece of legislation California Democrats just voted to repeal (California Proposition 16); luckily, we get to vote on it in November, but... liberals and progressives are not the same thing. I'm sure you've heard that the racists switched sides in the '70s, or something similar, but that's not true, we traded progressive authoritarians for conservative authoritarians, while liberals like me simply oppose all authoritarianism. The Overton window shifted, and it's recently shifted back.

To be clear, I'm not trying to argue anything, not saying who you should or shouldn't support, simply that your life is your own, and that you should focus on your own values, and then consider who actually supports them through action, because the battlefield of politics is dynamic.

Equality of opportunity, a liberal value, simply means eliminating artificial barriers, eliminating oppression.

Equality of outcome, a progressive value (""equity""), requires erecting artificial barriers, actively oppressing people.

This article makes a lot of retarded assertions, such as suggesting that people are *made* poor, while ignoring that a bunch of black and brown groups out-earn whites; a better example of this would be Shatavia Walls, IMO. Officials told New Yorkers to settle things neighbor to neighbor, instead of calling 911, so she did just that when she saw people setting off bigboi fireworks around little kids. [She was shot eight times, and died.](https://nypost.com/2020/07/19/brooklyn-lady-killed-over-fireworks-followed-eric-adams-lead-mom/)

>I guess it depends on what they mean, this article mentions other already-tested ways of reducing police duties.

\>absolutely drenched in critical theory

Police aren't showing up for alcohol withdrawal, an ambulance is, and that is absolutely something one should call 911 about, if not a disgustingly dishonest example; however, I seem to be in possession of some ancient, rarified knowledge which I have yet to see represented in any article on the subject: **Police already have a non-emergency number.**

Why doesn't anyone know this? I mean, fair enough, in most places it is a local number, so you'd have to look it up, but... if you're on a cell phone, google is one touch away these days. 911 is an *emergency* number, why are people calling it for non-emergencies, and is that a police problem, or a citizen problem?

>AOC said something about how cities should police like white suburbs, because apparently white suburbs police to protect and advance the community, rather than to shoot the baddies, but AOC said it, so it is probably wrong.

Suburban policing isn't really any different, it's just that people in the suburbs aren't killing each other over nothing, and that police are far, far less likely to be shot by suspects in the suburbs than in the city... also, population density. Like, I don't know if you're familiar with the [the North Hollywood shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout), but it's not the police escalating things, it's criminals.

Furthermore, there's a deep, deep irony in that progressives will say that women need to be careful because every man is a potential rapist, and that black people need to take extra precautions because white people might be racists... but... shoe on the other foot, it's racism and/or sexism. A white person crossing the street because a black person is coming the other way is racist, even though they are ten times more likely to be victimized by the black person than vice versa... but the black person taking precautions, justified!

I was referring to the original term, IV League, as in Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth, but I suppose ""public ivy"" always has been, sure.

5009,E,N,T,J,"I think that's a separate issue, more akin to not knowing what one wants, and thus one has a hole they don't know how to fill, so... they just start tossing shit in, you know? This kind of attitude is, to me, far more inline with something like drug use; most people don't do drugs because they want to do drugs, they just want to fill a hole in their life, if only temporarily, and this prevents them from needing to find something genuinely fulfilling.

Mind you, this isn't entirely an individual failing, great swaths of society have dedicated themselves to discouraging meaningful activities; for example, how many women fill their need for intimacy with Tinder hookups, and how many women in their late 30s are complaining about not having a family? Mind you, I believe people are individuals, and thus should pursue whatever they like... but I don't really think that's what's happening here, after all, marriage is patriarchal oppression! xDD"

>Harry Potter isn’t really written super well tbh /shrug

Did Ron use the word ""bitch"" in book three upon your reading? It was on the train to Hogwarts. Curious to know what revisions took place.

EDIT: Wrong button, come back later.

>People do refer to white as “Caucasian” fairly frequently, right? Kind of inconsistent.

Yes, but... mostly a misunderstanding. A great many people who are Caucasian are considered ""people of color"", because only a retard would come up with that term in the first place.

>Was it not always marketing?

No, prior to the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 you didn't need a degree for anything outside of like, being a doctor or a scientist. Colleges were the home of higher thinking, not just high school 2.0 + alcohol.

>Not really an apt analogy, it’s Americans criticizing America. Besides it’s true that America continued the practice of race-based slavery longer than most other developed countries, and also fought a whole civil war about it, whereas Britain just quietly stopped doing slavery.

Britain actually bought the freedom of like 99% of slaves on Earth, with the other option being war, but big dick navy so no one fought. This resulted in ten generations of debt, 2014 is when the bills stopped coming. Probably should have been a significant year, but white people aren't particularly boastful. :P

>Having racism and sexism at its inception is different from being built upon racism and sexism, Thomas Jefferson kept slaves, but he also abolished the slave trade.

It's unironically white supremacy to imagine that white people *could* have emended all of the wrongs of humanity on a global scale, running back into time immemorial, overnight. xDDD

Yes.

5016,E,N,T,J,"Not really, working for another's gain was *also* the mantra of the (white) slave owners. They thought that they were rescuing black people from the horrors of Africa, and uplifting them into civilization. Further, you haven't actually demonstrated that self-interest is negative; I mean, you know how the Rothschild's initially generated their fortune? They created a new manufacturing process which reduced the cost of fuel by 85%. This alone likely did more for the poor on a *global* scale than anything else in history. Likewise, Steve Jobs didn't make a phone without buttons because it was a popular idea, people hated it, but because he did, millions of Americans now have ""computers"" they otherwise wouldn't. Tons of college students from poor backgrounds get by on a bluetooth keyboard and a smartphone, because one man had a vision he selfishly followed.

Trump is forcing a *lot* of manufacturing back to the US, so... that option is, by and large, coming off of the table. Obviously, China isn't the only cheap labor, and we'll see how things pan out, but... there is no downside to fuck China.

I'm 5'8"" and have a baby face, so that does add to my aesthetic ""cuteness"" but primarily I'm just ""cutesy""? Very ""soft boy"" and kinda childlike in a lot of ways.

Yeah, initially it was just because I sucked at games so I'd always get stuck and give up 😂 I wasn't allowed to own consoles growing up... But now I can usually finish them. Sometimes I still go back and forth between a few games before finishing one, bc of my ADHD. But I do finish them lol"

5139,I,N,F,P,"I’m so sorry. Please know you’re valid. And find another doctor to get a second opinion because this is so awful and dangerous. The hardest thing for me was no one taking me seriously. Finding a medical professional (my psychotherapist) who did, changed my world and helped me recover."
5140,I,N,F,P,I’d blend the eyeshadow over the browbone a bit more and do the eyeliner a lot thinner on the lids. You don’t have that much lid space (neither do i LOL)

5164,I,N,T,P,"How to get the correct accent, my accent still isn't bad but it's better than it was."
5165,I,N,T,P,why are yall acting so surprised that an unpopular opinion is on a subreddit named unpopularopinion
5166,I,N,T,P,"xqc hate became a literal trend during among us phase, these normandies probably watch nothing else other than lsf clips and do it for attention, let alone the 9 year old humor also remember that these children come from POGGERS tier content creators, don't expect much from their communities."

5191,I,N,F,J,"This has been going on for so long. It had stopped for about 3 months, until about a week ago it's happening again. Idk if spotify had solved the problem in the first place. It's annoying as heck tho."
5192,I,N,F,J,"Hey, I don't have a problem with that, but something else relating to the voting system. Do you think you could put an 'ok' button below the stars, so that it allows you to correct yourself if you misclicked. I understand, if that isn't possible, but it would be so much better with that. I love the idea of this website and am recommending it to my friends rn, btw."

5198,I,N,F,J,Love him too
5199,I,N,F,J,I heard that in their voices
5200,I,N,F,J,I'm taking back the crown
5201,I,N,F,J,Welp still made a mistake... at least I tried I guess
5202,I,N,F,J,IDKHow. They're absolutely amazing. Go check em out.
5203,I,N,F,J,"Pets yes, not babies tho."
5204,I,N,F,J,Transgender is not a gender. It is binary and you belong either to male or female. What you mean is non-binary (which is a type of transgender but yea)

5210,I,N,F,J,What do you mean. Those are the real lyrics.
5211,I,N,F,J,I spend too much time thinking about that exact thing
5212,I,N,F,J,"I guess that makes sense, but that doesn't mean none of our opinions are worth anything. I wouldn't want to educate anyone on matters I don't know much about, but that's not always the case."
5213,I,N,F,J,I do. But I'm also 18. And that makes me not 'too young to be arguing with' or 'too old to be living with their mom'.
5214,I,N,F,J,Make it NSFW pls.
5215,I,N,F,J,"So you're saying you're actively ignoring someone else's opinion, because of their living situation. I see, you're apparently more immature than the people you're talking about."
5216,I,N,F,J,"Very true. Before that school I am on now, I only had boring history teachers. I still liked history, though. But now I've got an amazing teacher and history is my favorite subject."
5217,I,N,F,J,Well to each their own.
5218,I,N,F,J,"That's a shame bc season 3 is better than season 2, and a lot would say even better than season 1. I'd recommend looking the defenders plot up (it's not much, what you actually need) and go straight into season 3."
5219,I,N,F,J,"Yess Dark is a lot better, I'm so excited for season 3. I also liked season 1 of stranger things, but quickly stopped watching as I started season 2."
5220,I,N,F,J,"It's just rly annoying that there's not one lucky protector.

Edit: no clue how I did it, but i used Loki, miles, scarlet witch, ms marvel and spider man to 3-star it. The team isn't even 80k. Just got lucky I suppose, after the 20th time."

5224,I,N,F,J,"That's what OP said. They just don't like her and it's their opinion. And they also gave their reasoning behind it, but that doesn't take away from why you like her. 
They actually said if you like Clara in the first place, you liked the season. They didn't."
5225,I,N,F,J,Damn I agree with you 200%

5229,I,N,F,J,"Hey, buddy. I hope once you're out of that hell-hole you everything gets better for you. But right now you gotta hold on to what you have, your girlfriend. All I can say is that it *will* get better, honestly. You're so strong to keep going through this, please keep that in mind. There are always ppl who will listen, even if it's just some random ppl on the internet. If you ever need anything, DM me, if you want.

5291,I,N,T,P,"Having glasses doesn't define your personality, also i don't have glasses and im intp"
5292,I,N,T,P,"her face looks like that because she in a crowd of people, not because she is second guessing herself. Also for a P type you have to take the assertive rule with a grain of salt because they don't have as much confidence that their choice is best over all even if it is the logical one."
5293,I,N,T,P,its safer to say INXP because you cant just tell if someone is a thinker/feeler from their face.
5294,I,N,T,P,I do have friends and they're wonderful also can't speak English but thats what makes them purrfict
5295,I,N,T,P,"""The 1860 Republican National Convention nominated Lincoln, a moderate former Congressman from Illinois, as its standard-bearer. The Republican Party  platform  promised not to interfere with slavery in the states but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories""

5296,I,N,T,P,"But the taxes needed for the repairs can be used in other places like feeding the people who can't go back to work yet, help the cause that is being protested (wont help this one but in other cases it can), or maybe congress will give them selves another pay raise it. Though we can only hope it's not the latter."
5297,I,N,T,P,"If they deface or destroy and own else's property government or not it's no longer a peaceful protest, also even if it's just the governments property that is hurt everyone will pay for it in taxes make those business pay either way."
5298,I,N,T,P,Abe Lincoln was okay with slavery just not the sale of a person (Kidnaping africans from africa and selling them to the US or slave owners selling the kids off because they weren't needed)
5299,I,N,T,P,Your really are that dumb
5300,I,N,T,P,"Yes it does. Astrology is the study of space (You know stars, plants, moons and the appearance, energy, or whats out there) ASTORLOGICAL SIGNS are the of some-ones personality because of said stars. So that means *You're wrong af wahwahwah*. In conclusion your the asshole in the wrong because *if you don't like it, just avoid it* because you don't have the elementary grade intelligence to know astrology is, even a six has that level of intelligence proving you are dumb the a first grader."
5301,I,N,T,P,And heres my prof.
5302,I,N,T,P,"Because the sub is about astro stuff not pics of your self for karma or attention and when people post stuff just for karma or attention it both ruins what the sub was made for and makes it much harder for people who what to learn or use this (or any) sub for what it meant to, because the people who will help those in want of learning or to help other people (if you want to see how it ruins a sub look at r/DarkHumorAndMemes A.K.A a place of dark humor and now its just as inocent as a puppy who hasn't pooped in your floor yet.) It hinders peoples learning because the people who come here to teach just find a hundred pics of selfies and can't find the person who wants help."
5303,I,N,T,P,One of them is ThiccMommyGF and i can't make out the other.
5304,I,N,T,P,...and step dads

5309,I,N,T,P,Will it turn nuclear?
5310,I,N,T,P,What is the law? I think was sleeping in that class.
5311,I,N,T,P,Who said NTs where proud of it?
5312,I,N,T,P,I feel i have to say that ISTPs aren't as good as promised because the ISTP i know in real life brakes everything he touches.
5313,I,N,T,P,INSPs don't exist
5314,I,N,T,P,The point of a lie is to make some one belive in the non-logical by making it seam logical (For example fairy tales)
5315,I,N,T,P,Lie
5316,I,N,T,P,"Adding to the part about younger INTPs, most of us grow this ""I Don't Care"" vibe because we're either seen as an 'asshole' because we are blunt and truthful when we try to help others and they take it the wrong way (it takes a very long time for them to understand if they ever do) or we brake social norms that we didn't know were there and there pushed into doing the crime because if they get trouble they might as well do the crime because ""who cares if do as I'm told I'll get in trouble either way so i don't care""."
5317,I,N,T,P,Putty
5318,I,N,T,P,I don't i sleep during the day.
5319,I,N,T,P,"We're not bears, bears are quick at killing destroying there oposers, we're more like cats we play with them till it gives in but insted of killing we let it suffer to study its suffering."
5320,I,N,T,P,i prefer to use neither because face to face it easier to tell if there lying and if they being truthful
5321,I,N,T,P,"id leave them a note in there mail, so i dont have to talk to them."
5322,I,N,T,P,"Try using the idea of horse shoe theory (to far right make you the same as far left) and it might make for more 'accurate' placement of the types because an (for example) INTJ can fit in both ravenclaw and sylithern as more of a very in the more refined parts of some ones personality.

P.S. maybe moving around houses for better fits."
5323,I,N,T,P,why not side by side?
5324,I,N,T,P,Banana
5325,I,N,T,P,"No, i should but i dont."
5326,I,N,T,P,Then how do you explain Fe in a INTP? Clause INTP's don't care about the harmonious answer just the more authentic (something new) answer.
5327,I,N,T,P,Yes but non-religious would have been better
5328,I,N,T,P,"Why do you keep saying your an INTJ? It's clear your very emotional and can tell the future with ease, so you must be an INFJ in a very 'sensitive' mood. Try taking a deep breath and accept what you are and maybe you'll feel better with yourself and be much less of an entitled asshole."
5329,I,N,T,P,"Its not my style of game, im into games like battlskyrim, fallout, skyrim, ectra. so i stay away from it because of the fact that you just build it might be cool like minecraft but after awhile there isnt anything else left unless you mod it and i dont think you can mod AC."
5330,I,N,T,P,What wrong about being a pussy?
5331,I,N,T,P,0.1428571429 weeks
5332,I,N,T,P,"depends on how the 'positive' is used
as something nice? no
as a joke about what the type could be, but isnt? yes"
5333,I,N,T,P,why?
5334,I,N,T,P,same rules would apply since INTx's are found by others and rarely do the 'forging'
5335,I,N,T,P,The magical powers from Eragon and a blue dragon egg (that will hacth for me)
5336,I,N,T,P,"*pstst* I'm an INTP, and i was saying it as a joke."
5337,I,N,T,P,(in a monotone logical voice) then INTx's would be in last because they don't care as much about the 'friends' compared to the result.
5338,I,N,T,P,it really depends on if its a good day for the INTP because they are the 'smartest' but in burst unlike the INTJ which is much more constitant but not as 'smart'/stays at one level on intelligence.
5339,I,N,T,P,No
5340,I,N,T,P,And the INTP did any prep?
5341,I,N,F,P,"Yeah, from the first impressions, they look kinda rough around the edges, they’re also much thicker than usual, and some of them lack a glossier finish all around."
5342,I,N,F,P,Good bot
5343,I,N,F,P,Are those legit?
5344,I,N,F,P,"Damn, best memories that you can’t mentally recollect are even worse"
5345,I,N,F,P,"My God..... 

If I ever got my hands on a stash that great, that would probably be the end of me for sure. 

I’d probably hire a personal assistant to attack me if I lost my own control."
5346,I,N,F,P,Is this actually a strain of datura? I used to see these all around town and places like at my childhood elementary school. I’d stomp on them or see them all dried out and hollowed.
5347,I,N,F,P,"Looks like whatever weed was in there, definitely got dusted with whatever that is lol"
5348,I,N,F,P,"Same, but I was using one of the smaller containers, with the threaded plastic lids. That thing shattered close to my face, so I was damn lucky to be wearing my glasses, fortunately."
5349,I,N,F,P,"You’re still lucky to even be sitting around that range. 

Keep toying around with this beautiful fire and you’ll see how fast and good that candy keeps tasting."
5350,I,N,F,P,I need me a D W  plug like this
5351,I,N,F,P,Lol what kind of work do you do?
5352,I,N,F,P,Snorting acetaminophen though.... damn
5353,I,N,F,P,"That’s pretty reasonable as it is, with an extra 5 on top.

$1/mg is how it’s traditionally been done for years to come"
5354,I,N,F,P,"Oh yeah, if I did or didn’t get the job after, I’ll still eating and sniffing all of those in one go 😂😂😂😂"
5355,I,N,F,P,Let’s wait for the re-branding to rise up once again.... It’s a bottomless pit and there is ALWAYS profit to be made from medical patients and everyone alike.
5356,I,N,F,P,"Ah man, I remember last summer when I’d be picking at my scalp and constantly taking off patches of skin. Even if it wasn’t bad enough to go past the top layer, it would sometimes take a bunch of hair out with it, and leave me with bald spots."
5357,I,N,F,P,You definitely wanna keep that disinfected and dry as much as possible. File down the rough edges and maybe keep another bandage on it for a bit longer while it heals.
5358,I,N,F,P,"0.5 the deal for OP’s???

Damn, people near me still get taxes on those, and will have to pay $1/mg + $5-15 extra, depending on how many fakes are going around."
5359,I,N,F,P,"I’m motivated by both love and finding my significance. I know I’ve ruined a few potential friendships with 2’s in the past from my unhealthiness. I would force them to take off that facade of theirs, and well.... it wasn’t always pretty underneath and they sure couldn’t handle dealing with that. This was mostly with 2w3’s however. 2w1’s were a bit more collected in my experience."
5360,I,N,F,P,"If this isn’t avoidant me, idk what is.... lol"
5361,I,N,F,P,"What kind of job is it? 

And as a lazier 4w5.... I’d probably piss all of you off, depending LOL"
5362,I,N,F,P,"Type 4 SP’s are the anti-type, so they’re the variant that would go against the usual and avoid their feelings"
5363,I,N,F,P,"I rarely deny my feelings, unless I’m actively just trying to avoid them. Even then, they’re as true as they get, and it’s more of a matter of me rationalizing them, so that I don’t become delusional."
5364,I,N,F,P,"Was that in the US? I’ve almost never seen pharmaceutical ketamine tablets, only ketamine HCL injections, made strictly for IV use or intranasal sprays."
5365,I,N,F,P,I’m assuming that zipper tongue is removable?
5366,I,N,F,P,"Oof man, what exactly landed you in this boat....? I can only imagine that you’re not fully enjoying it"
5367,I,N,F,P,"I’d sniff a 1/4 of that OC 80, eat a quarter of a Val 10, and smoke that small nugggggg"
5368,I,N,F,P,"It’s my tritype, and I have my 2nd strongest type energy that follows with tendencies from type 6. You can only imagine how paranoid and suspicious this makes me. Lol Even as a type 4 who has spurts of wing 3 energy, I still get very uncomfortable and can become avoidant, in order to avoid potentially negative outcomes."
5369,I,N,F,P,"As a 469 stack, I feel this heavily"
5370,I,N,F,P,I swear the pressed 30’s around the west coast always had some runoff chemicals in them when they were tested. I can only imagine the smell of burning sugars would only make you more comfortable to smoking presses. 😂😂😂😂
5371,I,N,F,P,"Unless you’re going big time, these RP’s smack just fine if you eat them. If you’re gonna sniff them, I wouldn’t recommend going for more than 1/2 of one. Lmfao a shit ton of filler powder"
5372,I,N,F,P,I definitely missed seeing those when I first started college years ago lol
5373,I,N,F,P,Lol makes having the OP’s look like a side game
5374,I,N,F,P,"If people know what’s in them, and around how much of the stuff there is in them, don’t waste them lol"
5375,I,N,F,P,Properly worn 🙂
5376,I,N,F,P,"I never even knew Nordstrom Rack actually carried gothesque/grungey boots like these in stores, especially platforms."
5377,I,N,F,P,"Yep, with the original “OC” formulas, you wouldn’t have to bother with any of this shit at all. Hell, you could swallow the original OC’s 24/7 and get almost as high recreationally, whether it’d be comparable to sniffing it, boofing it (with the exception of IV). 

With these annoying timed release tablets, you’re pretty much shit outta luck with options. You can see the desperation in the dudes who’ve tried to shoot these up, and they end up getting gel in their veins and nearly dying."
5378,I,N,F,P,"I’ve tried everything in the book for these things, known to man, and nothing else works better than soaking the cut up pieces in an acidic drink and waiting for it to eat away as much of the gel as possible."
5379,I,N,F,P,"Nah, the extended release ones absolutely suck ass for recreational purposes, especially if you literally just swallow them straight. 

Even if you chew them up or somehow cut them up, etc., it starts gelling up, and that just ends up potentially making it harder to break down. This makes it impossible to feel the effects recreationally, but you will feel it over the duration of a few hours.

Versus the soda tek, where you can keep it in a fresh acidic drink for a few hours after you cut them up, and they break down the gel as much as possible. From that point, you can chew up the rest of the bits as you drink and it’ll hit you like a train wreck. Lol"
5380,I,N,F,P,"Auto color “enhancement” lmfao 

Nothing fake to see here. 😏"
5381,I,N,F,P,"Man.... I remember the first time when I “nodded” off of about 20 mg of Norco 5/325’s with absolutely no opi tolerance at all.

Real good nostalgic times, and I hope to take a long enough break to get back to that point, aside from the money burning process of this so-called “hobby”."
5382,I,N,F,P,"I really have not seen these since middle school. And as for circumstances that would place me in scenarios where I’d be able to see them... well, that was a questionable time of my life LOL"
5383,I,N,F,P,Literally my entire academic life summed up into a nutshell.
5384,I,N,F,P,Which one? The one where the dude in England is dumping full capsules out onto his hand and then straight railing the piles? Lmfao
5385,I,N,F,P,"Let’s hope that whatever you’re snorting, is even water soluble enough to work through sniffing.... I know tramadol and methadond aren’t. And I know hydrocodone isn’t readily available by itself, so you would be snorting APAP too..... 

Your sinuses must love you."
5386,I,N,F,P,"Man, if only I had kept all of my writing.... I didn’t choose benzos, only due to the amnesia that it would generate. Opi’s were my poison of choice and I would embrace the chemical persona that it would give me. I would feel fueled and entitled by what the chemicals could drive me to do.

I hope you heal soon and start driving on the new path."
5387,I,N,F,P,How many ug were the roughly ~4 hits of acid worth?
5388,I,N,F,P,That could’ve gone much worse with the table
5389,I,N,F,P,"Lean that has codeine doesn’t even hit me lol If anything, it’s probably the promethazine that makes me drowsy. It’s good as a potentiator for other opi’s, but that’s all I find codeine lean good for. Hydro sauce, on the other hand....."
5390,I,N,F,P,You might as well hop onto hydro and oxy tablets
5391,I,N,T,P,"I won't even dignify the social ""sciences"" as being actual science because they consistently fail the final steps of the scientific method: replication and reproducibility. It's just fun games with statistics. Certain things about them are useful as heuristics, and that's why I'm here."
5392,I,N,T,P,Less than damn.
5393,I,N,T,P,Either black or with half and half. Sometimes with cinnamon or nutmeg. No sugar. Always espresso.

5396,I,N,T,P,"Definitely wolf. It makes morning work crappy, but at least I get my best hours mentally to myself."
5397,I,N,T,P,"I tried Dvorak once and hated it. I like QWERTY because it spaces letters far apart to prevent typing mistakes. I'm a touch typist. However, I can't tolerate most laptop keyboards because they're inconducive to anything other than hunt and peck."
5398,I,N,T,P,Gross. Any time I go there I have to get really specific with my order so it tastes like an espresso drink.
5399,I,N,T,P,Third grade I think.
5400,I,N,T,P,"It's in grave danger. And no, I don't think that freedom of speech should only apply to legal immunity from prosecution. You also should not be able to be censured by your employer or school for your opinions, no matter how socially distasteful, as long as you are not acting purposefully as a representative of the same. Consequences for one's speech should be strictly social."
5401,I,N,T,P,Uh yeah. Have you seen how much sugar syrup they put into their drinks? It's for basic bitches who pretend they like coffee but really just want expensive liquid dessert.
5402,I,N,T,P,You want rat strikes? Because that's how you get rat strikes.
5403,I,N,T,P,Dogs. They're already man's best friend.

5405,I,N,T,P,"I hate it when people call the current situation ""quarantine"". I'm not quarantined, and neither is anyone else where I live. I've been going to work every day as normal, just with a mask. However,  the funniest mask I saw had a middle finger on it."
5406,I,N,T,P,">for example, Taiwan, they hold empathy to a far higher standard and would actually consider people who aren't ""team players"" to be rather stupid, seeing those that are willing to work in teams collaboratively in far higher regard.  

Basically any country that values collectivism will be similar. By that standard I would be considered profoundly retarded because of how much I detest teamwork by default."
5407,I,N,T,P,You sure that you haven't any?
5408,I,N,T,P,Good. I have seen the term used entirely too broadly on this site.
5409,I,N,T,P,"Huh, I got the same score. I'm surprised that there was no score difference."
5410,I,N,T,P,"Do you even know what a redneck is, or is that just a generic slur?"
5411,I,N,T,P,"I get that, but if you're on an American site it's a moderately safe assumption. Also, stupid opinions aren't just coming from Americans. There are some pretentious Europeans on this site that also need to get stuffed. Excluding people based on geography wouldn't solve the problem of idiots with a keyboard."
5412,I,N,T,P,People not talking about politics until next year.
5413,I,N,T,P,"It wouldn't cut down on the ignorant opinions here, so I'm indifferent."
5414,I,N,T,P,It pretty much only has a single element in common with the other Pokemon games: catching. It's too simplistic.
5415,I,N,T,P,"There are nonreligious universalists, or at least I think there are. Relativism seems to be the prevailing view among this site's userbase."
5416,I,N,T,P,Nope. I uninstalled it pretty quickly once I saw how one dimensional it was.
5417,I,N,T,P,"And also its opposite, moral universalism, which holds that goodness in the moral sense is independent of one's opinion on the matter."
5418,I,N,T,P,I just like unusual food. Always have.

5421,I,N,T,P,"Haven't tried it (heard the horror stories), but I have eaten century eggs. Those also smell like ammonia from the protein decomposition, but in this case it's the lime they're cured in that does it."
5422,I,N,T,P,"Probably because they knew that calves drank milk like every other infant mammal, so it's very obviously food. It's just that some humans evolved to keep lactase production into adulthood,  and that coincides with people groups who raised lots of cattle."
5423,I,N,T,P,It's not bad if it's fixed well. Virtually no taste.

5440,I,N,T,P,Speed limits outside of school zones.
5441,I,N,F,J,"Normally universities send out acceptance offers in rounds, from what I’ve gathered. First round is their top choices of students, second round for others. It’s hard to say how long it takes, because it depends how many people work in admissions at the university and how many people apply. It’s also much more likely that you would get a regular acceptance offer than a conditional offer (though it depends on how competitive the school is)."
5442,I,N,F,J,"Yes, I think for regular academic streams conditional offers may still be taking into consideration grade 11 marks, but it’s possible for a university to say you need to raise them x amount/keep them the same if you want to get in. Sorry for any confusion. 

For me, I’m in the IB program so none of my grade 11 marks are official, and my teachers predict my final grades based on grade 11 and universities normally give conditional grades based on that"
5443,I,N,F,J,"Canadian university applications are MUCH easier than in the US. we do not require any standardized testing, no personal essays, and most do not even require extracurriculars.  Through google you should be able to find the online application to any school you are hoping to go to. Most universities also often have a page where they list scholarships, bursaries, and grants. I believe US citizens who choose to study in Canada can still get aid from the US government, from what I’ve heard."
5444,I,N,F,J,"I have a friend that went there for a year, and I also have a friend who just got accepted. I haven’t really heard much about the CS degree there, but my friend said the high tuition price was not worth it for her history degree, because it’s pretty much just the same as anywhere else. 
My friend that just got accepted is excited because she loves the campus and the program she got into suits her perfectly. 
Generally, universities across Canada are very standard and the actual courses/reputation do not vary. You should base whether you want to go on whether you like the location, will be able to get good funding, etc. You should keep in mind that Sackville is an extremely small town, if it can even be considered that. If you are hoping for a small town vibe then you will like this location. It isn’t too far from Moncton or Charlottetown if you were to want to visit larger cities for shopping purposes/exploration."
5445,I,N,F,J,"One of my teachers studied at UOttawa and she never stops talking about how much she loved it! Most people would agree that Ottawa is also a beautiful city. It’s incredible to walk around. I’ve been to parliament and a bunch of museums and they were all very nice. I especially admire the bilingual aspect. 
I have another teacher who studied there for 1-2 years and he really liked it as well, especially the activities he could do on his free time, like skating on the Rideau Canal. 

I’ve also seen some of York from the outside. It’s very modern looking"
5446,I,N,F,J," it’s actually quite expensive compared to many European countries. We were comparing it in one of my classes. 

The reason for international tuition normally being doubled is that most international students and their families have not lived in Canada most their lives and been paying taxes, which is what funds public universities."
5447,I,N,F,J,"The quality of Canadian universities in very standard across the whole country. Most of them are government funded (unlike how in the US, the larger ones are usually private). On average, the more students a university has, the more “prestigious” it is, though not many people pay attention to things like that here. The most popular universities would definitely be the ones in Ontario, but also including ones outside of Ontario like UBC and McGill. The only advantage i see to large universities would be the wider choice of courses, but I would always prefer smaller universities because of smaller class sizes, smaller walking distances on campus, less traffic, etc. Somebody that receives their degree on the west coast has just as much chance of getting a job as someone who studied on the east coast. It’s generally all the same for undergraduate. With graduate and post-graduate, location of study definitely will matter, because many uni’s have very specific programs"
5448,I,N,F,J,Messaged u
5449,I,N,F,J,I think that’s what most places do. Good luck!! I just applied to my university of choice today :)
5450,I,N,F,J,"Depends on your country. 
In Canada, most universities only look at your transcript, but when applying to scholarships, having done research papers will definitely be useful. If the place your applying to considers your extracurriculars, then yes, it might be very helpful"
5451,I,N,F,J,"Depends on if you’re applying to a competitive school. If you are 100% sure you’ll get in, apply now. If you think the English mark might ruin your chances, wait until you get midterm report cards or even finish the semester."
5452,I,N,F,J,"Which country are you going to study in? Which university? Is it an online or physical application? If it’s an online application and an essay is required, it would have somewhere for you to upload a file. My country does not require essays or anything like that, only a transcript"
5453,I,N,F,J,I know tons of people who have gone back later in life to get their graduate/post-graduate degree. Don’t think it should be an issue for most schools
5454,I,N,F,J,"Yup! If you apply for early admissions you generally have a higher chance of being accepted, and you’ll still have to sent you grade 12 marks sometime after semester 1 for scholarship/bursary, and your final marks once you graduate. Your university may give you a conditional offer if they won’t take grade 11 marks into consideration. (Tho I know in my province grade 11 marks do count)"
5455,I,N,F,J,I also had to apply for the program but I would have been going to the same school anyway since it’s the one I’m zoned for.
5456,I,N,F,J,Imagine needing to pay oof
5457,I,N,F,J,"I was trying to fall asleep and this jolted me right out of bed. I didn’t remember seeing thunder in the forecast, and it didn’t happen again, so I was really confused"
5458,I,N,F,J,I have heard of none of these and I’m almost done of TOK
5459,I,N,F,J,"Straighten it out, then force it into the small space between the floor and baseboard. Or, take apart some type of electronic and hide it inside. A tv or laptop or something"
5460,I,N,F,J,"I couldn’t doing the test as they wanted because I will not accept the fact that death is unavoidable. You should see the car crumple test videos, it’s insane how well vehicles protect the passengers as long as they’re strapped in"
5461,I,N,F,J,"I’ve actually done this before, and logically, it would pretty much always make more sense to hit a barricade, since there’s a much higher chance to survive inside the car (crumple zones are effective),  than if a pedestrian was hit point-blank"
5462,I,N,F,J,"This might just be my opinion, but I think it would be easier if you did not mention ethics, since a knowledge question should be applicable to multiple areas of knowledge"
5463,I,N,F,J,"While it was a nice break at the beginning, i think it’s too difficult for me to stay grounded in reality without consistent social interaction. A month or two into quarantine, I struggled to complete the most basic online school tasks and pretty much never got out of bed except to eat or shower. The longer it went on I think I became more and more out of touch with the real world. I procrastinated al my summer assignments because I couldn’t  even figure out what the purpose of doing anything was. Now, since being forced to go back to physical school in September, I feel much better, and socializing and getting out all my deep critical thinking brain energy during school helps me relax in the evenings. In order for me to be productive I need to be inspired by others that I know, and I’m especially motivation by my competitiveness so I need to see how others are doing at things"
5464,I,N,F,J,"The concept is pretty intriguing to me, and that’s the only reason I really watched it. I unfortunately didn’t find it funny, but overall still enjoyable"
5465,I,N,F,J,"Normally a knowledge question is based around a few different knowledge concepts. I would not classify sacrifice, freedom, or security as knowledge concepts. I can share a doc my TOK teacher gave me about writing knowledge questions, if you would like. 

I was just thinking about your question, and how you could make it more broad. Freedom vs security kind of ties in with the idea of emotion va data, and the idea of sacrifice has to do with justifying an outcome, so, you could possibly go in a direction like:
To what extent does emotion justify an outcome?"
5466,I,N,F,J,You can go from thesis to fully finished essay in less than a week no problem
5467,I,N,F,J,"My final copy is due in three days. I wrote the first draft in June and never looked at it again, but it’s absolutely horrible and my teacher made a whole wack of suggestions of things I need to change. I also don’t remember reading any example essays, but throughout the whole year my teacher had been making us write practice essays and paragraphs in the style needed for the HL essay"
5468,I,N,F,J,"In my opinion it seems a bit too specific but I can definitely see how you can still create multiple different points of view from It. I recommend talking to your TOK teacher, they will give you their opinion"
5469,I,N,F,J,"When I was in grade 11, a friend has the EXACT same idea. Seems like it must be a pretty popular topic then, and normally more creative topics score better"
5470,I,N,F,J,"It’s possible to write an EE in a subject your school doesn’t have, you just have to read examples and make sure you use technical terminology that aligns with that subject."
5471,I,N,F,J,"With the new CAS, IB actually doesn’t care about hours anymore. Your individual school may still want them even 50/50/50, but according to IB as long as you’ve shown that you’ve met the seven learning outcomes well then you pass."
5472,I,N,F,J,"I’m just terrified I’m going to fail it. I’m doing a history EE and I don’t think my current question is analytical enough. I also have barely found any scholarly sources, mostly just websites which apparently they don’t really approve of"
5473,I,N,F,J,"My school has always run on a 4 classes per semester max but they make an exception for IB students, so instead of having the same four every day, our one IB class travels as a cohort to all our different classes on a 4 day schedule.

Also yes IB has cut a lot of exam papers, but there haven’t been any changes to CAS. My teacher that runs CAS says she will be much more lenient on what our projects are, but we do still have to show we meet all seven learning objectives or we fail and don’t get the diploma

Also you really shouldn’t stress about the TOK presentation. Just pick real life situations you’re interested in and you’ll be able to write it all within a couple days, then have tons of time to practice"
5474,I,N,F,J,Man I’m M21 too and also pushed my EE off for way too long. Now my first draft is due at the start of October and I don’t have anything written
5475,I,N,F,J,"Just got them today in TOK. They actually are all very good questions, compared to the old ones I’ve practiced with last year. my top choices being 1 or 3. I’ve immediately come up with some good RLS"
5476,I,N,F,J,"I’ve actually been doing this for a while. Not only does it force me to clean, but I do it much more quickly than if it was just a random day. And then at the end of it you get to have fun chillin with people"
5477,I,N,F,J,"Probably similar. I live in Canada and most people I know don’t have A/C. Some have electric heat pumps though, which do have an “A/C” setting. They aren’t really the best thing for winters tho since they stop working once it gets down to like -30"
5478,I,N,F,J,"I relate. It boggles me how easily people just accept facts about our society and sometimes never even question things. 
When an adult or parent would tell me “that’s just the way the world works” my first instinct is always to question how it can be changed to be better"
5479,I,N,F,J,Was this sarcasm or do you actually not realize they add artificial orange colouring to Mac n cheese
5480,I,N,F,J,"Also, at least where I live, passing two cars in one go is illegal"
5481,I,N,F,J,I feel that it’s probably the dongle(s). I have one that uses Bluetooth 5.0 and doubles as a receiver and transmitter from TaoTronics and I bought it on amazon for $30CAD. I’ve used it so I can connect my beats solo 3 (which have the same chip as AirPods) to my tv
5482,I,N,F,J,"If you go into settings>accessibility>audio/visual then there is a slider for volume balance between the two sides, so even if it’s a hardware problem like if one is plugged then you should be able to somewhat fix it still"
5483,I,N,F,J,"My plan has only unlimited texting and weekend calling, no data, and is almost $30/month. Canada’s pricing is goddamn ridiculous. Im with bell and I don’t have any other choice because they have the top of the cell towers in my area and all other companies have crappy service"
5484,I,N,F,J,"Holy crap, so I basically don’t have to stress about remembering all these books. Best news ever. I can read a book three times and still not be able to remember a quote from it"
5485,I,N,F,J,"All schools in my province are reopening, but we have to wear masks in busy places like hallways. In the cafeteria we’re supposed to enforce social distancing but we don’t have to in the classrooms since it would be impossible. They are also doing it so that we will have seating charts in every class in order to limit the amount of people we have to be close to (but I doubt my class will do that since as IB we travel as one cohort together to every class). There is apparently going to be screening questions before you are allowed to enter the building in September, and you will be forced to go home if you show any symptoms. Everyone will also have to sanitize their desk at the end of class

Many people are saying we’ll probably open then quickly close again, but I honestly think we’ll stay open since we have no active cases"
5486,I,N,F,J,"If it wasn’t IA or a final exam then just always remember: what does it matter? It doesn’t count towards your final score. That’s what has kept me going when I get less-then-great grades. Also it’s odd seeing what other people do in bio HL, because in my class we don’t do any projects like that and the only thing we get “marks” on are the topic tests, but even then the only thing those count towards is our predicted grade. My bio class is literally so chill, all we do is have class discussions and do kinaesthetic learning activities."

I seriously don’t know how I’m going to do it. Originally our first EE draft was supposed to be due in June but they moved it back before I had started it.

 I'd honestly distance myself from the whole lot of them and spend time with friends that treat me like a person instead of someone to do their dirty work so they can take credit for having solved the problem without having to make any sacrifices.

At first read, I thought Fe-user, but I can see how a Te-user could do that if Si wasn't dominant, ESTJ's can be real assholes and think they know how people should do things, but the real conflict-starters are ESTP's, and if the ESTP has under developed Fe, they could come off in a way that doesn't seem harmonious simply because ""they get stuff done."""

5503,I,N,F,P,"It could be anxiety that you're staying active to distract yourself from dealing with what's making you anxious. Also, for nightmares, tizanidine has helped me so much. I have PTSD and a really active imagination with vivid dreams. Trauma lives in whatever part of the memories you're downloading into long term storage at night, so talking to a therapist if you do have underlying anxiety or trauma is a good place to start."
5504,I,N,F,P,"I feel your pain. I managed to pass out mid-conversation at 9pm by some miracle only to wake up at midnight with a lot of questions about dumb shit. It hasn't gotten better as the day has worn on, but I'm happy to report that someone did, in fact, write an article about whether nudists do or don't wear clothes when they cook. I don't know if anyone else is sleep-deprived enough for this to seem amazing. But most of those dumb questions have already been asked and researched!"
5505,I,N,F,P,"I tried 5 ssri's and finally fluoxetine did it...for a while. I ended up on a really high dose and then I lost my insurance and I'm back at a lower dose again cause I'd tapered my way through my stockpile. I feel stable but still like I've traded numb avoidance for playful avoidance because I barely work, don't clean, and barely talk to people. Baby steps? Trying not to expect too much and all that is a tough balance.

Honestly, I start feeling colors again when I challenge myself to step outside my comfort zone a little at a time and hang out with people or play games online. And then try to remember to write down what I'm thankful for about myself. I usually forget, then have to tell myself that's okay. Let myself retreat into games when I need it.

Unfortunately, falling in love also brings back the color, but when that leaves or if it gets bad, I end up being pulled back down into that void.

One of the trauma centers I went to offered art therapy. I wish so much I was still in it, I should look back into it. I started doing a thing where I'd talk about an experience and also try different mediums (my favorites for emotion textures are chalk pastels and watercolor pencils cause blending). They weren't making headway with me with regular talk therapy because I don't have words for the emotions, just the details in the environment that I described. My feelings were better suited to visual mediums. Communicating what different textures and colors represented to me (I'd often find myself making bubbles and other little vaguely human-like shapes that were blocked or such or dark in some spots or bring choked by vines in others. The act of someone listening and being accepting of that had a strange effect of increasing my awareness of my feelings in myself, then in others. 

I still struggle with using words that would make sense to anyone outside of my head, but I've recently found it cathartic to express the emotions in whatever words come out because sometimes people are really supportive and might make a light joke to show they get what I mean, that helps bring me out of that fog.

One person recently randomly thanked me for taking care of a  friend's rat and raising money for its surgery to get arm amputated. Honestly, everything in my life fell into a hole though, I was in a bad place. I was just trudging through doing just enough to keep me and my animals alive, but I wasn't there. And someone thanked me for helping something have the best possible life it should because I needed to be recognized for that--and it about broke me. But in a good way. Cracked open the walls of the cage I forgot I was even in. I didn't feel like I was doing enough, every day push myself to exhaustion, rinse, repeat.

I'm telling you all this because I could relate to another of your posts that I read and I wanted you to know that there's hope, but not just one thing. Many little things, slowly, with compassion. You might not ever be able to be ""on"" every day, but aiming for an hour a day at first, or a day a week, or whatever small chunk is manageable before you feel yourself shutting down and needing to go back to familiar territory.

There are people out there who see you. Most of them don't have the words, themselves. But sometimes it's nice and people defy what seem like the laws of the universe and somehow things change.

Also, look up Carl Rogers. A person with similar issues to me bought On Becoming a Person for me years ago, and even though I still haven't finished it, that book and his idea of the therapeutic value of unconditional positive regard in therapy and friendships/relationships, transformed what I thought was possible from interacting with other people."
5506,I,N,F,P,"I didn't notice a tolerance to it. I also tried higher doses for about 6 months, never liked how it made me feel and didn't notice it affecting my motivation the way I needed. Switched back after I'd been off adderall long enough to start at a lower dose. One thing they do that I've noticed helps, though I don't know why, is that I take IR Adderall dose in morning and then in 4 hours, half that dose. It's just written 1 and a half pills per day. Maybe intermittent steps like that could help? Whichever part of the day needs more focus. When I originally started back on Adderall, they stepped it down at night to help stop PTSD nightmares that got worse at higher doses (that I needed to concentrate), so I can still do a higher dose early and then it tapers off throughout the evening. I didn't have as much anxiety with modafinil but I definitely couldn't have handled two doses without being up half the night. Structured half doses are easier for me to manage and also still sleep"

5516,I,N,F,P,"They find someone to mooch off of or they become more skilled at what they do or they become better at obfuscation. They might sell drugs, they might flip houses. It depends on how much money they have saved up. Your colleagues will be fine, their children might be placed with the other parent if they aren't able to provide. You don't have to worry because they aren't likely to expend energy where they don't have to and all of the rest of it, there are other people (possibly other family and friends) who are keeping an eye on things with the children."
5517,I,N,F,P,"Workbooks can be just as effective as talk therapy. It can help to talk to someone you trust about a traumatic event, but also reading resources for how to cope in the months following trauma, how to know if you need to see a professional (sometimes it's PTSD and requires more attention by someone trained specifically in domestic violence or sexual violence. I hope that you find supportive people, especially people who validate that it wasn't your fault and that you arent broken. 

You will have good experiences that will make you forget all about this. I promise. When you start things with a new partner, ask them ahead of time if they are okay with comforting you if you start thinking about the past trauma. Sometimes building that trust by stopping what you're trying to do sexually with the person and them comforting you can strengthen your trust and ability to be sexual with them. Asking ahead of time keeps you from being stuck crying or scared and needing emotional support that they aren't prepared to give or able to give. This helps prevent you being retraumatized. Good people will be willing to listen to your needs. You deserve that."

5522,I,N,F,P,"oh yes. It's something I've had to learn to forgive myself for, and not be so strict with my health regimens. There's only so much one person can do, and no matter how many things you know about being healthy, putting new habits into practice is slow work and doesn't happen because you've scheduled it to. I also have to remind myself (almost daily) that I don't have to be perfect, it just has to be good enough to pass. And some days, that means I don't pick up the dog poop when she poops on the floor because I'm too freaked out to leave the couch. Is that ideal? No. But it's a work in progress and it's taking time to get there."
5523,I,N,F,P,"I hate when this happens. My skin symptoms are always this way. I'll have a crazy rash and make appointments but then the day they go to check it or biopsy it, I don't have the rash. But then, you can't schedule an appointment except like 3 months in advance, so it's just the luck of the draw. There have been times I've debated whether or not to do things that cause me to have a flare like a week or two before my appointments just so I can show them I'm not crazy.

If your symptoms are visible, take pictures!"

5530,I,N,F,P,"I have an ENFJ friend? who every year or so unblocks me to cook me dinner or offload a bunch of old furniture on me or celebrate something with her and then blocks me again after spending the whole day talking about plans. I think I may be doing something to upset her, but I'd never know because she just blocks me as soon as I need to talk about anything logistical or efficiency oriented."

5532,I,N,F,P,"Not sure if this is similar, but I get a lot of pains in my intercostal muscles that massage therapists have told me is myofascial pain. A lot of autoimmune disorders have pain in muscles/joints/connective tissue. I wish i had a regular massage therapist to work on me, but so far I've managed with rolling against racquetballs/foam roller and the floor/wall all along my spine, sides, shoulder blades until i find the culprit knot and release it. Stretching in a pool or hot tub also helps me. I need to see the chiropractor again and see if that helps."
5533,I,N,F,P,You are probably fortunate enough to not have dealt with long-term exposure to someone who gets super sweet to get their way.
5534,I,N,F,P,"Wouldn't send so detailed, but depending on the person (some of my friends are super emotionally resilient and i don't have to worry or ask) I'd just start talking about the subject or I'd check in with how they're feeling before unloading

Reading this, I would feel like it's so nicely worded, that I'd be a jerk if I said no, despite feeling overwhelmed just reading it. I don't know if that's more of a reflection of my inability to tell people no or if the wording is manipulative. I often can't tell and just avoid my phone for several days."
5535,I,N,F,P,"There's a thing that happens to people with BPD where they have a push-pull dynamic. They feel needy, but they are uncomfortable around someone who needs something from them. Schizoid pd also has trouble with that, it's an engulfment avoidance, wanting to avoid having someone else's needs/emotions burdening them. Usually, it's the result of having an emotionally invasive or emotionally incestuous parent. They defend against having someone ""take"" their...energy? Not sure how to describe the defense mechanism.
Whatever is the cause of it, you guys should bring this stuff up with a therapist if possible. That's my best advice. They're trained in coaching couples on how to communicate their needs effectively so that both people get what they need and feel heard.
I get a vibe that he had an overbearing parent who didn't allow him to express his true feelings about things, and so he just withdraws whenever he is upset and has relied on you to read the signs about what he's not saying. 
If nothing else, look up schema modes and see if he identifies with any. It helps me a lot to do exercises about which mode is activated and what the core belief that got triggered is.

5554,I,N,F,P,"Yes, i understand that but by not caring whether you die or not (which means having no interest in your life) doesn't that also mean that you find your life to be meaningless? That's why I think its nihilistic."

We have become so disconnected from ourselves that we keep seeking validation and ""meaning"" in things that don't really matter and will always make us feel empty again in the end (social media, obsessions, tv, materialistic things, money etc).

5614,I,N,T,P,"My grades for the past two semesters had to be one of my biggest insecurities until I remember that almost none of it was my fault, but then again, I made some bad choices for what classes to take"
5615,I,N,T,P,6
5616,I,N,T,P,Can confirm
5617,I,N,T,P,He does have a point: the fake heart shapes were meant to look pretty or something to that extent
5618,I,N,T,P,I've found it easier to help critique others by being on the side or back-side of the one who's cleaning as well as I've seen many others critique from that angle. I'd consider putting the camera on the side of yourself or back-side next time
5619,I,N,T,P,I'm guessing it has to do w/the strike. I've been in marching band for four years and noticed my heels tend to wear out faster being every stride while marching begins w/striking your heel to maintain a good level to the ground so one doesn't bounce up & down. I am pretty heavy as well being a heavy-weight lifter but I wouldn't say that quite matter's as much for finding out why a specific spot in a shoe is wearing out more
5620,I,N,T,P,"Totally not helping you out, but whenever someone tells me to ""squeeze my chest,"" I think of the David Hasselhoff scene in the Spongebob Squarepants Movie lmao"
5621,I,N,T,P,It's mostly ppl who aren't fulfilling their responsibilities while 'stealth' camping who make the experience bad for everyone else
5622,I,N,T,P,"That's subjective. Depends on how big your vehicle is, where you're staying, if they can clearly tell someone's living inside (like cooking inside, for example,) and so on. Also, there's certain responsibilities ppl living that life need to wrk w/ (no cooking outside if in the city unless you go to a local park and other stuff like that)"
5623,I,N,T,P,"It definitely seems hard not to be more sociable considering how you'll bathe [depending on where ya live/go (unless you have a van big enough to accommodate a shower or instead buy an RV,)] getting food, etc. If you wanted to live in one, maybe living in rural areas or camping outside of town would be easiest for a more reclusive life"
5624,I,N,T,P,"This is one of the many reasons why I'd like to live in some sort of city (close) to the mountains: Portland, OR (also since it's in my home-state,) Denver, etc. I also like dry heat more than humid so places in the south would be fine, but IDK how well it would accommodate my life since I'm seriously thinking of getting into the so-called, ""van life"" to cut down housing costs + I don't want to live w/anyone else for a while until I go to my 4-year"
5625,I,N,T,P,"I always go by this rule: if you feel sick below the neck, don't wrkout"
5626,I,N,T,P,"Hello, friend! It's nice when others initiate the first conversation unless someone interests me (in whatever manner.) Unfortunately, when I'm the one initiating the first conversation, I realize I've made a horrible mistake w/who I've decided to try and converse w/"
5627,I,N,T,P,*unachievable
5628,I,N,T,P,"Watching ""The Theory of Everything"" was a pretty good way to end my night- I cried once and teared up two other times after already watching it like four times"
5629,I,N,T,P,"Ok my grandma's poorly developed intuition and judgement seriously pisses me off to no damn end, but I can get along well enough w/many other than SJs considering my best friends an ISTJ"
5630,I,N,T,P,"As of today, yes"
5631,I,N,T,P,"If it's from a guy (my same sex,) then I'll take it more seriously. When it's from the opposite sex, it feels like they're sort of pressured to do so usually w/not much meaning behind the compliment"
5632,I,N,T,P,I haven't messaged my new match once since we matched two days ago. Oops
5633,I,N,T,P,Me and my INTJ roommate get along well enough. She does her thing while I do mine most of the time w/some friendly interaction most days
5634,I,N,T,P,"I used to relate to the, ""underachiever"" part, although I still remain the same level of energy as depicted in the graph"
5635,I,N,T,P,I listen to the same ones but add more on top of them
5636,I,N,T,P,"Honestly you don't need a mixed grip if the weight is that easy for you, but I would consider investing into some grips once you start lifting heavier to not take the risk of tearing your bicep"
5637,I,N,T,P,Those moments when I realize the wrongdoing I have done make me want to kms just for a fragment of a moment.. I then go take a nap b/c naps are always the resolution to resolving my anger
5638,I,N,T,P,"I think it's cool & thoughtful when they do it, but some ppl push it when I don't believe they're ""worthy enough"" to either just understand or they're not someone that's actually good at listening to you speak abt your problems. In the end, it leads to me having to lash out due to them not getting off my d*ck"
5639,I,N,T,P,"I think it's an effect of swaddling almost, at least to me. I'm not that tall really, abt 5'10"" and feel that also. If I'm not in a sort of ball-shape, which I currently am right now as I'm typing this, I'm in a fully stretched out figure and need to have something cover me like a blanket. I'll do the same thing as before w/my feet moving as if I'm marching somewhere while counting to eight (effect of doing marching band for 4 years,) or I'll do calf raises w/my right leg while counting to 4. Sometimes I'm flexing or scrunching my toes since it's very unnoticeable"
5640,I,N,T,P,"I happen to brush my hands into my hair while leaning forward, seated, w/the constant shaking of my leg/s looking frustrated frequently and when someone asks me something along those lines I happen to not even answer them, usually. I know they wouldn't have the capacity to understand how comfortable I feel in the position so I figure, ""why even bother?"""
5641,I,N,T,P,I will specifically order a pizza and not eat the crust just to spite you. Fuck you.
5642,I,N,T,P,Only good pizza crust is thin pizza
5643,I,N,T,P,"Or.... Let the man eat pizza the way he wants to.

5644,I,N,T,P,"Extra calories.

5649,I,N,T,P,"Nope. I physically cannot do that.

I dissociate all the time, though."
5650,I,N,T,P,Maybe. Who knows at this point? Haha
5651,I,N,T,P,Was I correct? lmao
5652,I,N,T,P,"I'm not sure what your concept is there, but I understand enough when you say there's no depth. You mean to say it isn't applicable to all, and so it should be somewhat discarded or altered in order to become applicable to all? But in that case, wouldn't you be reworking the framework?

Also, yes, that's why I am here too. I use MBTI and socionics in order to understand how people and myself function. I am also very accurate in my observations, though I'm not quick to jump and type someone unless they have obvious signs that I've seen before. I make my own framework using the cognitive functions, but it does what it has to do."
5653,I,N,T,P,No. I'm strictly going by Jung's words.
5654,I,N,T,P,"It still isn't really possible.

Speaking from everything we know.

There's no point in using this framework at all if you're just going to disregard the base theory like that. I would instead say it's very possible to strengthen your ""shadow"" functions, but you cannot use them naturally as you would your main functions."
5655,I,N,T,P,"I guess so, but if so why are you even using Jung's framework?"
5656,I,N,T,P,I'm waiting until I get inspiration from the DIYs and furniture I collect.

5692,E,N,T,J,"LOL, let’s hope it gets better"
5693,E,N,T,J,"Thank you for responding, i appreciate it. I heard to stay in coop, you need to be in a certain grade range. Is this true? And a lot of ppl say the ce program is hard so would it be wiser to go for CS so I don’t fail out of coop?"
5694,E,N,T,J,"Thank you so much for respresponding, I saw somewhere that they used top 5 3U/4U marks for early admissions, do you know if this is true?"
5695,E,N,T,J,"the last portion about uottawa 😂😂😂thank you so for responding, I don’t think I would have found out about somethings without you, I really appreciate it. could I PM you if I have questions later on?"
5696,E,N,T,J,"thank you so much for this, I’m from Toronto so i don’t know much about the school, area or program. This was really helpful. 
If you recall, how many courses did you take in first year, ive been looking through the website and it’s showing things like 0.5 or 0.25 credits which I don’t understand lol & how’s the environment at Carleton?"
5697,E,N,T,J,"oh wow thank you, would you recommend Carleton over Uottawa for engineering? How’s the workload? I know for coop you have to keep 8.0, is that attainable?  & what do you think would be a good average range for applying?"
5698,E,N,T,J,"oh I forgot they called it computer systems engineering here, mb haha"
5699,E,N,T,J,im honestly so thankful to your response. I seriously appreciate it. Thank you
5700,E,N,T,J,"wow, I’m first lol. any students applying to ce or currently in ce? PM me"
5701,E,N,T,J,Lol I heard about the rivalry thing too haha & thanks for the advice. I’ve looked at the first year courses at both Carleton and uOttawa and they’re pretty similar which would make it harder to pick between both of them.
5702,E,N,T,J,"thank you so much for responding, 
- a little question: what’s “FED”? you said carleton’s FED is better.  
- so Carleton & uOttawa are pretty much equal, but if you had the chance to pick between both, which would you choose?"
5703,E,N,T,J,thank you sooo much for responding. Is Carleton engineering really better? I’m from Toronto so I don’t know how the uni environment is in Ottawa.
5704,E,N,T,J,"sis, if you can’t help her just swipe and move along. obv she’s got questions no need to be so damn rude."

5719,E,N,T,J,you’re free to have your opinion even though it’s dumb af. 😂
5720,E,N,T,J,"so confused on how racism towards asian ppl and the BLM movement have any connection at all. if they wanted to post n raise more awareness on racism towards asian ppl n how it’s so normalized nowadays they could have done so. And what you said about “white ppl who have been beaten by savages yelling BLM” is dumb af. Yes there are black ppl who are racist af towards asians, but there are also white ppl, latinos/hispanics and a lot of other dumb fucks. The BLM movement is about raising awareness for black ppl and other minorities who are being disregarded in the US. His argument has no basis n makes no sense. (& what have ppl done in the name of BLM that have made it “lose its good intention”. )"
5721,E,N,T,J,what does making fun of asians have to do with the BLM movement. It’s true that racism toward the asian ppl is heavily normalize but the BLM movement is about black people who are killed and disregarded.
5722,E,N,T,J,that was fkn hot

5735,I,N,F,J,It’s interesting that you say that INFJ’s have big egos🤔 are they male or female  ? In my opinion I don’t think I have a big ego.... I just find it rude to show it off if I had any But I have heard that some do you have big egos which I do find frightening.
5736,I,N,F,J,That meeeee!
5737,I,N,F,J,Fr! Darn thoses charming ENTJ’s ☺️
5738,I,N,F,J,You sound like me when I talking about theses problems because we have the same problem. The reasons you put are exactly why I don’t tell people much of what I like personally.
5739,I,N,F,J,I actually really like not getting notifications/texts from people it’s draining... at the same time I wish someone text me first 😅.
5740,I,N,F,J,😳..... damn it you got me😅guess you guys do what you want 🤣.
5741,I,N,F,J,You can control me 😖!
5742,I,N,F,J,Interesting 🤔
5743,I,N,F,J,I agree with this! As a infj female I would like to know if I have a problem (especially if I am hurting you) of course I may be upset for a bit but I always end up seeing their side and apologize.

5748,I,N,F,J,THANK YOU! I’ve always felt mature for my age .I’ve always been told by classmates in the same grade as me also but the downside is that people think you’re no fun😢
5749,I,N,F,J,Lmao 🤣
5750,I,N,F,J,Honestly tho 😂lol Couldn’t have been more correct
5751,I,N,F,J,It’s definitely an introvert problem 😅 it happens in text too when you’re in a group chat.
5752,I,N,F,J,I hate when it does that 🤣
5753,I,N,F,J,I’ve met a infp they are so sweet and cute <3 love y’all too.
5754,I,N,F,J,🥺
5755,I,N,F,J,You can message me when you want someone to talk to.😊
5756,I,N,F,J,Yeah I do 😢 I daydream a lot about this sort of thing. I would like to get into a relationship but you don’t want to rush it especially in high school 😅I’m hopping in college I’ll find somebody.
5757,I,N,F,J,Forget about why the chicken exists think about all the facts about the chickens  and different types of chickens.There is so much you can learn about chickens 😊

5759,I,N,F,J, If only there was way we could feel this satisfaction.
5760,I,N,F,J,Lol that’s cute
5761,I,N,F,J,Lmao the love the name Juan 🤣
5762,I,N,F,J,I know one of my friends don’t like to be touched  when they are upset... it scared me and first when she said “ Don’t Touch Me!”.The way she said it and the tone made me cry but I need to understand that other people have different ways of handing “am fine” situations.
5763,I,N,F,J,No one I know can understand me well 😖
5764,I,N,F,J,I have terrible grammar 😑

5773,I,N,F,J,You don’t want to be a infj 😅if you want to know more you are free to dm me
5774,I,N,F,J,Same they are so interesting 🤔
5775,I,N,F,J,I am weird😂 sometimes when I vent I ask for your opinions and solutions.
5776,I,N,F,J,Being off beat normally makes me feel bad(I’m also in band) but seeing this gives me anxiety.
5777,I,N,F,J,A few times 🤔
5778,I,N,F,J,Yeahhh..... i’ll become more flirty if it’s somebody I like but yeah once in a while I catch myself acting a little flirty around my friends. I think my biggest line is probably “sh—shut up 🤣” then I push them a little. Bad thing is I don’t want anyone thinking that I like them.
5779,I,N,F,J,Can relate😢I am good friends with one of my friends in high school when one day this new girl showed up and she clicked with her so quick like three weeks quick! We went on a out of state field trip and when it came to a three person group she chose her instead of me same with other people who click with her or thought she was cool (like I known you guys longer and you are fighting over the new girl) low-key kind of made me feel bad and I know this one dude was joking but it’s still kind of hurt when he said (because my first name was her last name) said she was the better(my first name).she was pretty smart she only stayed for a year and a half before going to early college and when she left most things went back to normal.
5780,I,N,F,J,Lol 🤣nah you good I was probably the weird one.
5781,I,N,F,J,Lol

5831,E,N,T,P,"When I started university (which was like a month ago), I realized how far you can actually get with a decent amount of organization without overkilling it into routine. My trick is to try to chase for new things within what I'm learning and digging deeper into important aspects of the learning material. 

That said, I hate focussing more than 15 minutes on something and if I'm given a car, free gas and free insurance, I would most likely choose traveling the country over college."

5833,E,N,F,P,Yep! I made it. It wasnt as hard as MEPS is normally rumored to be. In all honesty i think they wanted me to pass. So not much to be afraid of!
5834,E,N,F,P,I know right?! I did that earlier with my recruiters boss he asked me if I had any scars anywhere on my body and I said no without thinking about it and he was like are you sure? and I said yes and he basically asked me if im lying or if there is anything I forgot and I said no nothing i forgot to mention and he said okay now go tell them that at meps and theres obvious scars on my legs and it just didnt hit me right away lol
5835,E,N,F,P,Okay! What is a removed bite?

 I've noticed my anxiety nearly drives me insane thinking all the time. Like if God is real then where is the evidence? I find when i try to believe in a religion i question everything. I've decided to believe in the universe. Believe that there is something beyond this world and question it no further than that. That has given me peace and no one will change that. I promise."

5860,E,N,F,P,"Where i am, almost no one wears masks and everyone hates the quarintine. There were protests and now no one wears them. Im working and all the customers have stood within 6 feet and ive literally forgotten about the quarantine at this point. Also a lot of women are different so i dont see your point. No one is the same. You can't date every girl. Some are into you and some are not. Also you say i ignore what you said but you keep missing the point my excercise so i should stop wasting my breathe and i think you should stop wasting yours too. If your anxiety is so bad you should get help."
5861,E,N,F,P,I dont recommend dating apps at all. I say delete them because i used to be pretty decent with girls and i used to date girls a lot until i started dating app. I too thought the apps would be easier but before you know it you're getting attached to every girl you see and they won't give you the light of day. So i say dating apps are terrible just wait out the quarantine and start approaching again.
5862,E,N,F,P,It's a reflection on her not you man! I hope she figures things out. Also good work on the 15 approaches. Im beginning to start game and i tried approaching today but i couldnt approach a single girl... So 15 sounds great compared to zero lol
5863,E,N,F,P,Very good point!
5864,E,N,F,P,"Dude, i love old fashion i honestly regret ever downloading a dating app. I wish i had just done things the natural way this whole time. Dating apps have worsened my anxiety and i actually feel more creepy on a dating app than just meeting someone in real life lol."
5865,E,N,F,P,Wow i am going to try this! I have so many books i bought and i dont read because i always feel like i need to get out and meet people. I think i'll try readi g my books in public areas! This is a cool tip!
5866,E,N,F,P,I was literally just talking about that tip number 3 with my friend earlier. I really like it! Great job!
5867,E,N,F,P,"I do not understand where this notion comes from lol Ive talked to about a dozen women over the years and they have all said that men don't approach them and that they wish it would happen more often. I even made a post about a month ago (maybe) asking if it was okay if i approached women and a woman responded and told me to please do it more. I have done my research and have learned from female dating coaches that it is okay to approach a woman you are interested in. Hell even my female therapist even told me to do it 😂 so i do t understamd this idea that women ""hate"" it. I wish women would approach me and say ""I like you, you're cute"" i know that would even be hard for a woman to say to man or a man she was interested in."
5868,E,N,F,P,Just research man and it's just like a gym session lol. Also ive been socially anxious for so long now that im fed up with it! Lol ive been trying to get over my anxiety for 4 years now and today im just like fuck this feeling im challenging it right now! If you want to join me on kicking anxiety's ass please pm me i promise i can get you to my level (:
5869,E,N,F,P,I hope you know that women make fun of men on Tinder all the time. So yeah i am viewing this from a woman's perspective pretty well. We live in an age were men cower behind their computers and hit on women from the safety of their own homes. Real smart... thanks (:
5870,E,N,F,P,Thanks a lot man! A sane one out of the bunch (:
5871,E,N,F,P,Tinder is for cowards and honestly the worst thing that will most likely happen is that she says no. It's not the end of the world 😂😂
5872,E,N,F,P,I see it as 10 people who are seriously scared for reasons i can't comprehend. It's my life if i fuck up i fuck up. I never asked for anyone's advice. Im just sick of this SAD and ive never even given this a chance.
5873,E,N,F,P,You're twisting my words. We all have worse case scenarios in our minds before we even try. That is depressing. Trying and failing and treating the failure as a victory shows you that it's not the end of the world when something goes wrong. For instance if you give a speech you will think everyone will laugh at me. You give the speech and everyone claps when you're done. This is what we need to practice.
5874,E,N,F,P,Is this subreddit new? I half figured this is the reason it was made?
5875,E,N,F,P,I really appreciate your concern! 😁 ive learned how to take care of myself. Thanks! (:

5878,E,N,F,P,"It's called exposure and my courage is very low. This is me psyching myself up.

5940,E,N,F,P,"I was 15, found out about it when Sleeping At Last's ""One"" came out. I'm currently 18. Since you've started at 16 and is now 19, I suppose we've both been studying it for about the same time. I haven't studied it as much as you, though. All I know is really basic, and based on what I've found on the internet. I've also never been the type of people that dedicates myself studying something for a long period of time. I usually aggressively study it for a few days or weeks, than leave it for months, even.

So, I can say with some certainty that I'm a 9w8, but I keep second guessing it every now and then. A while ago, I thought I maybe was a mistyped 6 (which now I'm sure I'm not). Recently I've been wondering if I  I'm a 7 (probably not either, but that little bit of doubt is still there).

I've been in one of those burst of study energu lately, trying to learn more about the other types that have nothing to do with minr, so I can understand people and the enneagram better."
5941,E,N,F,P,I specially like 2 and 6
5942,E,N,F,P,"I've felt like that in the beginning, but then I started to put to use my ability of ignoring my problems and unpleasant feelings and tried to just focus on my online classes. At some point I just started to accept how things are, and since I had made a decision to live in the present and make the most out of it even if it's not ideal, I've been trying to do my best on what I still can do given the situation. For a while, I just takes it till I made it, and recently it's been showing some results. I've been also trying to see the good sides of it (even if there aren't many). For example, I'm finally slowly getting my life together, I eventually started to exercise again, and putting some more effort in my studies. It's still far from perfect, and I've been having lots of fallbacks through the way, but I'm getting there at my pace. 

Sorry for the long and scattered rambling, but I guess what I'm trying to say is: Yes, we've been loosing out on a lot, but try to focus on what we still can do and put your energy into it. If we still do something, anything, our time won't go totally to waste during these months.   

I hope this made some sense"

5948,E,N,F,P,"It's nothing that innovative or spetacular, but it's definitely good. It has good writing, good art, good fanservice, and it's fun. Also, you don't see that many space themed manga out there (at least I haven't seen them), so it's definetly an interesting change of scenarios."
5949,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, that's basically it. However if you're having trouble figuring out the dom and aux ones, looking at the other two may help."
5950,E,N,F,P,"Well, I'm not the best person to give advice on typing yourself, but here are my two cents anyway:

Focus on the ""hows"", not the ""whats"". Don't worry about things like ""WHAT do I think about?"" or ""WHAT do I believe in?"". Try to think about HOW you think bout something or HOW you came to believe in something. Two people with the same type can have completely different interests and opinions, but how they approach those interests and opinions is what defines their type.

I hope that made sense, I'm also not that good at explaining things."
5951,E,N,F,P,You can still be an INFP and wonder about those questions
5952,E,N,F,P,"You see that's why it took me so long to figure out my type, and still doubt it from time to time. And also the reason why I not always relate to all those ENFP posts that depict us as super nice lovely people. I wish there was a good analysis like that for all types."

5960,E,N,F,P,what is the difference between 最終 and 最後?
5961,E,N,F,P,"I gave up on religion already, but I can't get rid of the belief that there's SOMETHING out there, some sort of energy, I guess."
5962,E,N,F,P,"I agree with almost everything, but I never relate when people say ENFPs are good communicators. like, where did this come from? I'm terrible at it."
5963,E,N,F,P,"They probably got to that conclusion 'cause in nature hybrids are sterile, but it's really funny that they automatically applied this logic to a half demon anime dude."

5978,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, and for some reason it was really funny seeing Aldrom trying to figure out what he was like: ""human- no wait, a dragon's child- no wait, a demon- no wait-"". Like, I could almost see ""aldron.exe has stopped working""."
5979,E,N,F,P,"I really liked what Natsu said in the end, about burning the whole world if it makes an enemy of the guild. It reminded me of something he said in the magical games arc (I seached it to quote of properly) :

""If it's to protect our family, be it the Kingdom or the entire world... We would make anyone our enemy! That's what it means to be Fairy Tail""

This is something I've always found interesting in him. His main fight isn't for good, peace, or justice. Even though he may stand for those (as he did in this chapter, after Aldron said he took over 300.000 lives), he'll always fight for his family first, and above anything else.

And I think it was nice to see this consistency in his character, with such a similar quote so many chapters later."
5980,E,N,F,P,"Yep. I found out that reading out loud helps, at least for me."
5981,E,N,F,P,Loved it
5982,E,N,F,P,"Did you create the icons in the dock? If not, could you pls link to where you found them? Great work btw, it looks really nice!"
5983,I,S,T,P,"I dated a guy a while back who wanted to talk to me on the phone everyday, and the phone calls were not short! We're talking two hours or more, every single night after I got home at ~7pm, and still had to do homework, shower, go to bed, and get up at ~5:45am the next morning. It cut so much into my personal time that I broke up with him after a while of that. I couldn't do it.

When husband and I were still just dating, we often only saw one another once or twice a week at most. We never talked on the phone, but we did text everyday. We both just have our own projects, and don't enjoy spending too much time away from personal pursuits. There's nothing wrong with being closer or with needing space, so just focus on finding a partner whose needs align with yours. Easy peezy."
5984,I,S,T,P,I just mean it took growth to enjoy interacting with people for work.
5985,I,S,T,P,"I actually like my coffee black, so yeah, it me."
5986,I,S,T,P,Yay voting! But omg that line.
5987,I,S,T,P,I don't care about people not voting; I just don't want to hear your political opinions if you're not doing it.
5988,I,S,T,P,"It's paid? Nah, definitely going to pass then."
5989,I,S,T,P,"Oh good, quick, somebody tell my crippling anxiety."
5990,I,S,T,P,"Yeah, seems accurate to me. Ain't nobody got time for the big brain action on the left."
5991,I,S,T,P,You didn't have to listen to the first thread; both pictures look great.
5992,I,S,T,P,"Toilet humor seems to get me every time.

I've been subjected to enough dad jokes that I now find those hilarious too... It's rough liking such bad jokes."
5993,I,S,T,P,"I'm fine with texting and face to face, but please, for the love of God, don't call me."
5994,I,S,T,P,"All of this, 100%. This is exactly why the rich only care about tax law and anything else targeted at wealth, because literally no other aspects of government affect them in any meaningful way."
5995,I,S,T,P,"Same!!

""That's a big cockatoo... Wait, is that a chicken? *checks sub* ... It's a chicken.'"
5996,I,S,T,P,That looks tasty! I'm guessing you ate it with rice?
5997,I,S,T,P,🍞
5998,I,S,T,P,お前はもう…シェッ厶ゾ。
5999,I,S,T,P,"I only put in memorization effort for things I care about. If I don't remember something, it's because I didn't care about it when it was happening anyway. I generally have a bad short-term memory and a good long-term memory."
6000,I,S,T,P,"Fuck, so the fall was too high for the drivers to survive anyway. Here I was naively hoping a few were rescued from the water..."
6001,I,S,T,P,"I've been using another set of products with meh results on my little guy for years. Before the end of the world, I found a groomer I felt REALLY good about, but I haven't heard from her since lockdown ended, so I fear her business didn't survive. :( so I'm going to give this a try and see what happens!"
6002,I,S,T,P,"Yes, please do. In fact, if you could just walk in, turn right around, and walk out, that'd be greeeaat."
6003,I,S,T,P,"Thank you, I appreciate your kind words. Unfortunately, it's exactly what you say: friends I trusted to know better voiced indefensible views in front of me because of BLM. It's been a big blow to my opinion of this person, even worse because they've persisted, and this is a friendship that, in all the years before, never had a single political statement shared between us. I'm glad to know his true thoughts, but I also now know he thinks police brutality against my people is ok. Sorry but that's not going to fly, and now I have to deal with it because I won't allow it. Instead of giggling over K-pop, I have to take it upon myself AGAIN to educate someone that I deserve to be a person too. This is only one of a few friends I've discovered harbor indefensible views.

I think people should be able to discuss difficult topics, but I personally haven't had to discuss something so near to me and raw ever before. It makes me so disappointed and angry, and I only pulled away when I was so emotionally exhausted, I could barely function. At the end of the day, I want these people called out; I've just lost the ability to always be the one doing it."
6004,I,S,T,P,"Girl, I need your routine because my hair gets SO fucking tangled if I wait more than two weeks. The detangling alone can take an hour, and my scalp is sore the rest of the day."
6005,I,S,T,P,"This is a very interesting point. As a black woman, I just got so tired of seeing racism on my feed, here and on Facebook. The current political climate has brought out some shit people, which I much prefer to them being hidden, but I found myself seriously burnt out after enough months passed engaging with those people on a daily basis. I took the no politics weekend as a reprieve from the racists, and saw it favorably.

I find it interesting that you instead saw it the other way--as a way for those racists to be safe from me! It's honestly interesting, and gives me something to think about. I'll chew on this for a bit."
6006,I,S,T,P,"I'm taking a mini-break from Reddit because it stopped being fun to come here lately, and I really enjoyed the no politics posts. If you had asked if those posts were what I wanted beforehand, I would've said no, but I found it a much needed breath of fresh air. Reddit's entire appeal is its discussions, so that definitely needs to stay, but it's nice not seeing racism and polarizing issues sometimes. I say keep the no politics weekends; that still gives the majority of the week for the polarizing discussion. I'm personally uninterested in it."
6007,I,S,T,P,"Same, though my plumbing is also shit anyway."
6008,I,S,T,P,"Omg, I didn't even notice that until you pointed it out. 😂"
6009,I,S,T,P,"My condolences, and I'm sorry for your loss.

Do you know what ended up being the cause of the crash?"
6010,I,S,T,P,"Honestly, with CS, your prospects are quite large. If you like coding, there are plenty of CS grads who go down that path."
6011,I,S,T,P,"This, 100%"
6012,I,S,T,P,"Don't use MBTI like that. Just enjoy the relationship, talk everything out, and have fun. Life is for living."
6013,I,S,T,P,There was a daughter here. She's gone now.
6014,I,S,T,P,"Awesome, I love these. :)"
6015,I,S,T,P,Meanwhile I'm in this pandemic quarantine literally thriving. I'm seriously curious what this means long-term for me re: lifelong happiness. Do I just not need people for the most part? Is the hermit life the most compatible lifestyle for introverts after all?
6016,I,S,T,P,"I don't test specifically, but I work in software configuration and implementation. I do a fair bit of troubleshooting because legacy data can be all over the place, and I find that enjoyable. A QA tester could probably utilize the same skill-set which you may find enjoyable. I can't speak from experience on QA being enjoyable, but I don't think it sounds crazy."
6017,I,S,T,P,"Aw, Ito. It's not too late, man."
6018,I,S,T,P,... Nibba.
6019,I,S,T,P,"Hahaha, that's exactly what we did with ours."
6020,I,S,T,P,"It's been a long time since I rollerskated, but I can feel this in my toes and I don't like it."
6021,I,S,T,P,"I actually prefer having a plan, but I'm super ok with the entire project veering from it, so, yeah. No oh nos, just business as usual over here."
6022,I,S,T,P,"Immediately... Be sympathetic while eating your corndog.

God, now I want a corndog."
6023,I,S,T,P,"Absolutely! I made a whiskey sour with a barrel strength bourbon, and it was shocking how much better it tasted than my usual sours. I don't buy fancy bourbon either, so the difference was unexpected."
6024,I,S,T,P,"I want actionable advice. I only want this from close friends and family, but, if I'm bringing it up to you, I want your advice and recommendations on how to get through it and make it out on the other side. If I haven't brought it up, unsolicited advice on the topic is usually unwelcome, but it's not like I'll be impolite about it either. I'll smile and thank them, maybe take what I can out of it that could help, but I generally don't want unsolicited advice on how to handle my own life.

If I don't actually need any help working through the problem, e.g. if I'm just emotionally upset about something otherwise unimportant, I want to work through it privately. I don't go to others for emotional comfort in those situations, and just want to be left alone to process my emotions myself."
6025,I,S,T,P,I can't do this anymore. I just can't.
6026,I,S,T,P,Bi for me
6027,I,S,T,P,"Immature at best, a troll at worst."
6028,I,S,T,P,"Awww, that was so heartwarming. What a beautiful relationship."
6029,I,S,T,P,Ya love to see it
6030,I,S,T,P,You can never be too sure.
6031,I,S,T,P,"I'm super curious how you'll handle a Maine winter, since you kept the original bus windows (which I also want to do). I've heard they're hardly better than having no windows at all, as far as insulation is concerned, so I'm really interested in how the cold will go with your rig."
6032,I,S,T,P,"Why did I just have this problem not 30 minutes ago.

I settled on fajita nachos. They should be here any minute and they're gonna be gooood."
6033,I,N,F,P,"If ExxJs run the world, that means they're also responsible for many of the horrible things humans did throughout history."
6034,I,N,F,P,You don't go out to get groceries or take out the trash?
6035,I,N,F,P,ENFJs also rise to the top. ENxJs run the world and ESxJs middle-manage the world.
6036,I,N,F,P,This is how I feel about ENFJs.
6037,I,N,F,P,A psychic dictator.
6038,I,N,F,P,"We tend to not do that, sorry."
6039,I,N,F,P,"Hitler's army did pretty good even though it lost eventually, so I wouldn't underestimate INFJs."
6040,I,N,F,P,Did you ever have those super competitive bids where people go back and forth and end up going way over the starting price?
6041,I,N,F,P,"Waititi had 4 movies under his belt before he did Thor, Blade 2 and Hellboy weren't really huge blockbusters because comic book movies weren't as big as they are now (and Del Toro did 3 movies before those), Mendes did 5 before he did Skyfall, Fincher was an exception and the Alien franchise is nowhere near as big as Marvel.

Now mega franchises are trying to snatch directors after only one movie. Robert Eggers said in an interview that he received offers from Marvel and DC right after his first movie The Witch started getting buzz on the festival circuit. This might not be a new thing but it's intensifying."
6042,I,N,F,P,"""most of those were released in theaters""

Yeah in a handful of theaters, none of them had a wide release."
6043,I,N,F,P,😂 Nice one.
6044,I,N,F,P,"Marx was an INTJ, many of you guys probably know this."
6045,I,N,F,P,What about SPs?
6046,I,N,F,P,"Like plastic wrap? That's smart, unless you need to cut something on the plate."
6047,I,N,F,P,What was that relationship like? I like INTJs but I can't imagine dating one.
6048,I,N,F,P,And somehow you'll find a way to ace it.
6049,I,N,F,P,Your username is perfect if you're a female ENTJ.
6050,I,N,F,P,Are you Louis CK?
6051,I,N,F,P,Te values facts. I've seen INTPs reject facts in favor of what makes sense to them.
6052,I,N,F,P,ENTPs unironically think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. That amount of ego will get in the way of intellectual honesty. INTJs have a big ego but their Te keeps them in touch with facts. INTPs are the most humble of the NTs but their lack of Te means they'll favor their theory over facts.
6053,I,N,F,P,Solitary confinement is what we do to ourselves naturally. The rest was hilarious.
6054,I,N,F,P,...is exactly what the truck will do.
6055,I,N,F,P,This is ENTJ energy but he's an ENTP.
6056,I,N,F,P,The obvious one was also NJ
6057,I,N,F,P,"Te users will admit they're wrong if you show them evidence, while Ti users can reject facts or redefine terms to try to win the debate."
6058,I,N,F,P,"I haven't heard/read Fe described that way before, that's interesting.

Commanding respect without necessarily being liked is a more fitting description for ENTJs.

You don't necessarily like people who have things in common with you. Some of the most beloved celebrities have eccentric lifestyles that the average person can't relate to. Enjoying the same things helps in establishing a connection but it's not necessary. Personality and communication seem more important."
6059,I,N,F,P,"Popular doesn't necessarily mean you enjoy the same things as everybody else, it means you have a large social circle and a lot of people like you. It's true of almost every ENFJ I know, the exceptions are those who decide to shrink their social circle or those who suffer from depression. Being liked is one of the main features of Fe."
6060,I,N,F,P,How does paying someone to have sex with you make you less of a loser than masturbating?
6061,I,N,F,P,"I'm fairly certain he's an ISFP. We used to be roommates with other people. He would do things that impacted others without asking or telling others (moving/throwing away other people's things, changing the temperature on the thermostat, etc). It was a combination of his Fi-Se impulsivity and I believe his Ne blindspot which resulted in a weak theory of mind. You might argue that it was a lack of Fe but I don't use Fe either and I wouldn't do those things, my Ne would stop me."
6062,I,N,F,P,"> I think putting yourself in people's shoes has more to do with Fi 

Ne helps you see things from someone else's perspective, Fi tells you how would feel in that perspective, and together they help you figure out how someone else feels, but Ne does the groundwork of imagining and/or considering another viewpoint.

That's why I think Ne blindspot is deeper than not thinking of alternatives. It goes back to the theory of mind you mentioned earlier, I think Ne blind types have trouble considering other people's thoughts and opinions. This ISFP for example is terrible at figuring out what someone else is thinking, hence his persistence."
6063,I,N,F,P,"> Ni can take a what if to its likely conclusion, but it's not gonna give you the answer unless you ask the question 

I'm not sure I understand, can you give an example?

Considering alternatives is a big part of Ne but another part (which is related) is putting yourself in someone else's shoes and seeing things from their perspective. I imagine that if you're Ne blind you have trouble understanding or considering what other people are thinking, which would explain why my friend thinks he still has a chance."
6064,I,N,F,P,"It seems more like he's using his Ni to justify his delusional Fi belief that he still has a chance.

You mentioned theory of mind, I think that's precisely what he lacks, perhaps due to Ne blindspot. He doesn't seem to be concerned with what's going on in her head, otherwise he would know by now that it's a waste of time to insist."
6065,I,N,F,P,"Your description of the Fi-Ni loop is spot on, coming up with unrealistic scenarios to justify his beliefs is exactly what he does. Thank you for your perspective."
6066,I,N,F,P,"By appeasing the ego you mean indulging in his obsession? If so, then I understand what you're getting at.

So I guess his Fi-Ni loop makes him worried about the future and that's why he falls back to what he knows? In his case it's not just that he can't do the new, it seems he has a hard time even seeing or considering the new."
6067,I,N,F,P,"Looks like it, thank you very much."
6068,I,N,F,P,XNXP's attention span is proportional to our level of interest.
6069,I,N,F,P,"That's weird, when I do a reverse image search I only get a couple Russian websites without any specific description of the photo."
6070,I,N,F,P,"My bad, that would be even better, thanks."
6071,I,N,F,P,QuarckNL found it
6072,I,N,F,P,QuarckNL found it
6073,I,N,F,P,Thank you! Damn how did you find it? You guys are really good detectives in this sub.
6074,I,N,F,P,The thing is he seems to be fixated on the past rather than on the future. Is it something you guys do?
6075,I,N,F,P,"Forget relationship, she clearly doesn't wanna see him again, I don't understand why he doesn't get it or why he thinks insisting will change things."
6076,I,N,F,P,"She declined politely by giving excuses, but she did it often enough that it's pretty clear she's not interested, and then she stopped replying to his messages, I don't know if she blocked him though.

Yeah it's weird to me that he would even think about texting her again, like what does she have to do for him to realize there's no chance?"
6077,I,N,F,P,"Insisting with someone who already rejected you is a good way to hurt your ego even more, so why not cut your losses and move on? Sure, there's a small chance they might change their mind in some cases, but in cases like this it's crystal clear there's no chance.

As I wrote above, it's been months since she ghosted him, after turning him down, and they only went on one date. It seems crazy to me that he needs even more rejection to find out.

It's true that prioritizing what you have makes sense, but when what you have is not working it's a waste of time to insist. I don't even think for him it's a cost-benefit analysis, it really seems like working with what he has is the default mode and it's extremely hard for him to move on."
6078,I,N,F,P,"You're living the dream, enjoy."
6079,I,N,F,P,"If ISTPs are that low, how come I know so many ENFJs with ISTPs it's not even funny?"
6080,I,N,F,P,"You won't be twice as productive, you'll just split your productivity between two projects, so you'll have two half-finished projects in the same time it takes to finish one."

6085,E,N,T,P,"7, if real"
6086,E,N,T,P,"We have something like subreddit guidelines, Look it up sometimes!  
5s and 6s are accurate when you know of those guidelines.  
This sub has good system, because it is real unlike doing it face to face when people heavily inflate their ratings. Not really pleasant, but it isn't a point.  
Going by Gauss's Normal distribution almost everything is beetwen 4-6"
6087,E,N,T,P,"Dear ENFP, If you try, you may stop having a brain of a dreamy goldfish and be more logical.
But you probably wont, because you are who you are.
So let yourself be yourself and let myself be myself.
I am not going more emotional, because this is not me."

6093,E,N,T,P,"1. ENFPs- literally dream manic pixie girl
2. NTs - Someone I actually can be aroused intellectualy, because those are able to think. On the other hand most Often their thinking is caused by overcompensating their visuals. Nonetheless still their mind is pretty hot.
3. INFJs- I mean, as an ENTP i needed to write it somewhere. The only women i know, who get along with me fine, which honestly still suprises me. Kinda asexual, but if you're into this, reaaaly hot."
6094,E,N,T,P,Bad sense of humour probably

6099,E,N,T,P,"Oh, I love to engage in discussions with those. It is fine because I give no fuck for their feelings whatsoever anyway. So they expect me to be sorry for them, but oh boi, are they wrong."

You are quite beautiful, but I also see you are not a newbie in taking photos and being photogenic. It seems like we are seeing the best version of you, and if not so fixed, you wouldn't look that well. That said I may be wrong, we just can't know how do you look when you don't pose as much."
6103,E,N,T,P,"They do struggle for food, not all of them, some of them.   
People in third world countries often don't even have the access to social media. And let me assure, when they do, they are just as angry at priviliged pricks who scroll through reddit and think they have it hard.   


If you were one of those poor guys, laying in their 3 square meters apartment, you wouldn't feel called out here and frustrated, but you are.  
That says something."
6104,E,N,T,P,"No, you are not supposed to think world is not only better, but also it is pretty shitty.  
You are supposed to feel responsible for it, work for it to be better, not make yourself into victim mentality. Lay in the bed and complain, saying it is not your fault."
6105,E,N,T,P,"and so what, do you feel you are a victim here?  
do you want some reason to allow yourself to be the unfortunate one  for a minute?  
I am going outside, and I am seeing people complaining about bad economy, their gender, or what fucking ever, while drinking their tripple latte machiattos with extra caramel and vanilla on top.   
Well, you are not a true victim here, so stop behaving like one."
6106,E,N,T,P,"Also, whataboutism works rather when talking about some specific topic.  
If we were to talk about problem with obesity in America, and I would rather start talking about poor people in Africa, that would be whataboutism."

6108,E,N,T,P,"Well it isn't about you, and we both knew. There are some people on reddit who do, and oh boi, believe they do agree with me. Because they know this post isn't about them."
6109,E,N,T,P,"By seeing this you prove, you have internet access allowing it. And yes, in fact it is better than winning millions of dollars."
6110,E,N,T,P,"Well, I am not saying we shouldn't try to get better. I am saying stop complaining about your poor position. You are the fortunate half.   
It doesn't mean stop your work for society. It does mean, stop complaining because you are in fact ultrapriviliged."
6111,E,N,T,P,"Actually, I am quite anti-capitalistic myself.  
I just have problem with your western victim mentality and blaming the system, meanwhile you most probably are not the real victim here.  
And yes, the fact you are reading this means you are not the victim of the oppressive system, at least not more than any rest of us."

6117,E,N,T,P,"Fire in metaphorical sense.  
Having *fire* in your life.   
That is living with fulfilment.   
Spontaneus trips further than it is reasonable.  
Not coming home for night.  
Wind, rain and screaming at midnight into the sea.  
Parties that never end.  
People that don't burn down.  
Drinks at the beach.  
Dancing with loved ones in random places.  
A street, park in middle of the night.  
Bank will do as well.  
When others come with initiative.   
Women who smile a lot, and laugh loud  
that glorious feeling after fight  
Whisky, cigars and suits.  
City Noises  
Speaking to the big audience.  
Quick Witted discussions with intelligent people.  
Adrenaline rushes.  
Singing old songs loud with people.  
Running barefoot through streets  
Destroying people in discussions.  


It may sound edgy but it is honest."
6118,E,N,T,P,technically... you just did that
6119,E,N,T,P,"The point is for ratings to be sharp, extremely sharp. And that's why it is supposed to be fair. Because you operate on wider spectrum, meanwhile outside of this sub you use only 6-8.5

I don't want to sugarcoat anyone. Acne doesn't look well. It makes her look much worse, and that's why it is a major factor here.

Become the biggest troll, and read the legendary Icha Icha Paradise series.

Why kill Zetsu, when I can fuck him? I can kill some of him during fourth shinobi war and still get that happy end.

Observe and troll subtly the main cast. Be like Obito-Tobito just without genocide plan for shinobi world. (I just rewatched the series and my hate went sky high for naruto and sakura both. They deserve my trolling for better character development. Sasuke can get raped in Orochimaru's secret man cave, I don't care, it was his choice to go with that creep, he knew the risks.) 

Obscenly flirt with Kakashi about Icha Icha Paradise. The guy's reactions about those books were hilarious.

Tell Madara if his still in man cave the dirtiest jokes I can find and try to get reaction out of him. Imply something about him being shy. *wink wonk*

Be like a switch in bedroom between bad guy and good guy.

Travel elemental nations and get myself a flying jutsu. (I don't remamber if there was a dojutsu that enabled flight.)

Flirt with evil Tobito. Get that joke about being crushed by sadness running.

Meet Kakuzu, have a proper intelectual discussion about money, economics and bounty hunting.

If possible, give Hidan a heart attack/scare him to death via something. Continue the trend through all my time near him.

Flirt with Zabuza before he dies. Preferably with witnesses. 

Kick Naruto in the shin. No reason. Kyuubi can piss on me.

Taste the Ichiraku ramen. Discover why was it a magnetic plot point.

Shout ""PENIS"" at Boruto. Very important.

Poke Sakura. The paranoia of mass poker must spread. 

Have a scientific project and get more then few lessons from Orochimarakematatake.

Stay away from to cheery plot persons.

Learn seals. Bend points of reality I can't bend with my OP genetics.

Discover if Lovecraftian monsters actually exist in naruto universe. Get myself one as a cool companion.

Try relationship with nidaime kage of Iwa. Cute guy.

Flop around on the Hokage's building.

Never walk through a door. The window brexit shall be eternal.

Do a silly dance on top of a tree.

Go to a brothel. Fuck with beautiful men and women.

Do another silly dance in a middle of a field in front of everybody during fourth shinobi war.

Steal some forbbiden stuff.

Ride a bijuu into a horizon.

Bamboozle them bitches.

Make my own elaborate plan and conspiracy for main characters to unvail and become an actual big plot point in series with lot of connections to other plot points. (Maybe become a one time antagonist.)

Drink sake and warm plum wine because nobody but Tsunade does that.

Make some dirty jokes with/about Danzo. Flirt with every root agent ever.

Flirt with Kisame's sword. See if Kisame actually tastes like a fish and not only looks like one.

Drop-kick Kaguya in the head for shit and giggles. Also war effort.

Ask everybody fast forward in time why the hell did they name their kids bolt and salad.

Vomit into somebody's puppet.

Fuck around some more.

Die of natural causes via atomic disintegration at point blank range since I were the irredimable bad guy all along.

Get isekai'd again."

Fem3- mean bitch

Male classification:

Mal1- mean asshat

Mal2- cool asshat

Mal3- normie asshat

Non0- the never will be chad sorry (you still have real feelings, replace them with ""sociopath"" kit essential ones and we can talk about upgrading you to some higher place on chad spectrum)

Non1- mean gay prays the straight away

Non2- self victimisation karen 

Tran1- infiltration normie

Tran2- drag queen

Tran3- THE Drag Queen

Teacher shocked that I'm not who I showed myself to be to her for a whole school year. Her angry and disappointed at her own self telling me that she doesn't know what to do with me(She later learned that I do art which seemed to confirm to her that I'm not a lucky idiot for that one stunt). Me kinda bored on my chair just telling her I'm lazy because I can't reveal my game plan of low standards set by teachers for me to gain easy workload and not get constantly called in class. Her again falling under my act with under playing my strenghs yet again because I don't feel like paying attention in class I'm not on advanced course on. Happy me still doing nothing and just drawing for the whole period of her classes.

6257,I,N,T,J,"Either ISFP, INTJ or ENTJ then. Perhaps even ESFP, but what you’ve told me doesn’t really align.

If my experience of Ni really does resonate you, then these types are the most likely.
_________________________________________________________
Your irritability and anger issues seem very Te-Fi: I think ENTJ is quite likely. Though with your seemingly pedantic levels of scrutiny, 6th-slot Ti (INTJ) is a possibility. Though don’t seem to me like an INTJ - you don’t come off as being Fe-blind.

I think somewhere you said you don’t care about yourself - you can go long stretches without showering or looking after your own needs - unvalued Si? I think so. ENTJ makes the most sense to me.

And yes, ENTJs can be very introverted. They often go it alone because they step on quite a few toes - they enjoy being in control though they need their own space quite often.

ISFP and INTJ are still the two other possibilities. So if you’re *really* sure that you’re an introvert..."
6258,I,N,T,J,"Interesting.

Could you see your self as:

1) ENFP

2) ENTJ (not sure about this one)

3) ISFP

+Fi can be very altruistic - Fe can be selfish. Hedonism fits Se better.


What do you experience inside your head then?

My experience is a dreamlike state in which characters, conversations, patterns, and sometimes images are flowing without conscious thought or effort - Like watching a train glide across a track, as I wait to guide its direction. I don’t buy into the ‘scheming mastermind’ descriptions of my type, I refer back to Jung’s original works for a more accurate description of Ni."

6262,I,N,T,J,Nope - I *was* a bastard.
6263,I,N,T,J,"One thing I’m sure of: you’re probably an Fi user.

Just three specific questions:


1) How do you feel and behave when stressed?

2) What parts of your life do you actively avoid?

3) What is your immediate relationship with your internal *and* external worlds? (Your default Introverted/extroverted attitudes basically) +please include both - I possess Te+Se, though they manifest in short bursts, rather than consistent efforts. 

Jungian typology is a theory of cognition - I can’t form an accurate assessment without clear insight into your own *perception* and it’s associated biases. 

If you decide on a second opinion: 
Your video would work best as a secondary indicator rather than a primary source. One could check off any other type considerations before coming to a defined conclusion."

6270,I,N,T,J,No problem.
6271,I,N,T,J,"- Your liberal use of the word ‘love’. You seem to pick up on that yourself in the video. (Fi)

- You often introduce how you feel about a subject before sharing information on it: You say that you ‘love’ something before we even know what it is > this is indicative of a preference for judgement over perceiving. (Remember - IxxPs are judgers and IxxJs are perceivers) (Fi)

- Your love for linguistics seems to me like an Fi-Si fascination; not only can language be packed with emotional significance (Fi-Si), but there is also limitless potential (Ne) in how these values can be communicated. This is an assumption mind, so correct me if I’m jumping to the wrong conclusion in this regard. (FiNeSi)"

6423,I,N,T,P,"Oh, man. Where to start.

What I have to say about this is only my perspective. There are a lot of different perspectives on DID/multiplicity out there, both from academic writers that study it and from the community itself.

As /u/prettypattern pointed out, your average person who experiences themself as singular actually ""contains multitudes."" That's what therapies like Internal Family Systems therapy are based on. And experiencing more than one person/entity/locus of consciousness in the mind is a common hypnotic phenomenon, whether it occurs spontaneously or is deliberately induced. Erickson wrote a report on how he hypnotized Aldous Huxley and Huxley reported while hypnotized that there were two of him. John and Helen Watkins did a lot of work on Ego State Therapy in hypnosis (basically what the community of non-licensed-professional-hypnotists refers to as ""parts therapy""); they were of the opinion that the line between ego states and DID is not sharp, and their preferred treatment for DID was to reduce the boundaries between them so they existed as more like an average person's ego states.

So my view of how multiplicity, whether DID, tulpas, or whatever other types might exist, work, is that that phenomenon is the substrate on which it's built, and that certain uses of dissociative states (whether peritraumatic dissociation in DID, or meditation and hypnosis for tulpamancers) ""solidify"" alternate personalities into more-or-less permanence. ([Tulpas are not a metaphysical thing, at least not in the modern community. They're only very loosely related to anything in Buddhism.](http://www.blueflamemagick.com/index.php/2014/09/14/tulpa-not-what-you-think/) It's just the intentional creation of a second personality.) I don't think that experiencing more than one self is inherently pathological - and the authors of the DSM-5 would agree; one of the changes between DSM-4 and DSM-5 in the DID diagnosis was that in DSM-5, it explicitly has to cause distress or trouble functioning.

There's the question of whether the alternate identities are ""real"" that /u/prettypattern brought up. In the plural community, a common response to that is that the *only* thing that *anyone* can know for sure is cogito ergo sum - and so if multiple entities in the same mind all think they're real, then they've all passed that test.

Like the Watkinses, I don't think there's a sharp dividing line between ""real multiplicity"" and ""just ego states."" The diagnosis of OSDD-1a exists to describe an ""almost DID but without distinct separate identities"" system. All naturalistic human concepts have fuzzy boundaries (see the concept of a ""ring species"" for an example) - the map is not the territory. (See the [""Does It Work"" page archived here.](http://healthymultiplicity.com/))"
6424,I,N,T,P,"Yeah. Willpower is *force*; that's generally not a productive relationship to cultivate with your subconscious.

> Our headspace isn’t some inert, inanimate stage on which we perform our internal life dramas. It is the belly of a huge whale in which we find ourself living. It is a living space, with its own desires, emotions, and prerogatives, all of which can be at a cross-purpose to our own, and really, this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Our minds have minds of their own.

> Blood levels have been shown to increase in response to magnesium supplementation, but this does not signal that complete equilibrium has been established between blood and the nearly 100-fold larger body reservoir of magnesium. In fact, the much larger exchangeable pool of magnesium is more often called upon to augment blood levels to maintain a narrow range preferentially, which is a key reason why blood measurements can easily mask deficiency [122,123].

Homeopathy is based on the idea that ""like cures like"" (so a poison that causes a symptom you have will take away the symptom) and that diluting a substance makes it more effective. A lot of homeopathic ""medicine"" is diluted so much that there statistically will not be *any* of the original substance left."
6430,I,N,T,P,"Agreed. I was going to come back and talk about this point.

Their songs have always been highly [intertextual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality). Their earlier songs mostly referenced Lewis and the Bible - references that OP is likely very familiar with. But the theme of this project is ""where do our ideas come from,"" and it only makes sense that they'd open up to a wider pool of things to reference.

In an interview, they talked about how their musical influences growing up were mostly contemporary Christian music, because that's what their parents listened to. I think the small reference pool of their earlier music reflects that. As you note, the thing about ""Rose"" that OP is complaining about is a reference to Shakespeare; the thing about ""Soap"" that they're complaining about is a reference to chemistry. I think it's a really good thing that they're expanding their horizons in this way."

> I was hoping today's release would be different, but I was met with ""molecular rift... rudimentary lye... miraculous bind""

I don't think this is particularly obscure *vocabulary*, so much as the *metaphor* is one that a lot of people won't be familiar with. These lines refer to [how soap works](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/health/soap-coronavirus-handwashing-germs.html) (I actually wouldn't be surprised if that article was what inspired the song). ""Molecular rift"" refers to the fact that hydrophobic things and hydrophilic things don't bond with each other, but soap molecules are hydrophilic on one end and hydrophobic on the other so they can bond with both."

6484,I,N,F,P,...I need an ISTP to lean on.
6485,I,N,F,P,"calling people stupid because they disagree with you.   
I think before you meditate to learn Fi you should start enhancing your poor Fe instead."
6486,I,N,F,P,what about your comment was 'help'?
6487,I,N,F,P,wrong. I live on my own and pay rent on my own as well \~
6488,I,N,F,P,"that depends on the enemy. Are they fantasy monsters with no clear conscience who are clearly dangerous for humanity?: Then count me in. I will learn how to use it.  
Are the enemies creatures that have families, feelings emotions, are they even other humans without sociopathic and psychopathic tendencies who dont actually want to kill?: Get the gun away from me. I will talk to them instead."
6489,I,N,F,P,"Dont worry, I can definitely relate.   
But either way, therapy can be a good way to sort things out and make them clear inside your head. Its good to have someone professional by your side who can help you reflect on your thoughts.   
I wish you all the best in the future."
6490,I,N,F,P,Yep. But unhealthy functions in general make for poor people. Not a simple function like Fi.
6491,I,N,F,P,Thats not Fe. Thats Fi being able to adapt another persons emotion as if they were their own.
6492,I,N,F,P,Time to attack back.
6493,I,N,F,P,"Hahaha, I can see that happening. An INFPs passion is nothing to be looked down upon xD"
6494,I,N,F,P,you really think fi is about meditation? lol sure.
6495,I,N,F,P,I agree with Bakugo. ~~nice name~~
6496,I,N,F,P,"I think it can. Trauma can force you to develope functions that you wouldn't have relied on in other circumstances.   
I myself had a thinker mask during my teen years for the mere fact that showing my true emotions would have resulted in me getting attacked in my household. In a way I had to change myself in order to survive.   
Nowadays I see how that affected me. My Fi is strong because i expressed my emotion internally, my introversion is as well. I developed some Fe because I had to be aware of my surrounding. I forced myself to use a lot of Te but I got burned out as soon as I left the bad situation i was in and broke down. during therapy I'm in a Fi-Si loop and I'm trying to get my Ne back into working properly and I actually started doing sports, completely going out of my comfort way in order to have an outlet that has nothing to do with my Fi-Si loop.   


Before my trauma happened I remember having been slightly more extroverted and in charge of my friend group, so who knows."
6497,I,N,F,P,lol dont let an ENTP explain to us how Fi works. He doesnt even understand his own Fe most of the time.
6498,I,N,F,P,I dont want to hear from an ENTP that they know how Fi works. Do you actually think you have a better grasp of what your third shadow function is all about than someone whose MAIN function is Fi? I highly doubt it.
6499,I,N,F,P,so what you are saying is that small percentage might as well not even exist even though they do?
6500,I,N,F,P,"... You think introverts are maids with guns?   
(I would be the worst maid in history, just saying)"
6501,I,N,F,P,Doubtful. INFPs tend towards self-destruction when being hurt not violence towards others.
6502,I,N,F,P,As if I would ever be part of that huge crowd \*shivers\*
6503,I,N,F,P,even worse.
6504,I,N,F,P,INFPs are neither inferior nor lacking in comparision to other types. Plus individuality is a thing.
6505,I,N,F,P,Do you want the short or the long version?
6506,I,N,F,P,I disagree
6507,I,N,F,P,Wouldn't that mean that you can turn that statement around and conclude that might be ENTJs too rash as well?
6508,I,N,F,P,"I've been told by an INFJ that I have developed Fe in their eyes since I give it my best to involve myself into the stories of other people.   
I think the way you grow up can influence which cognitive functions you train. I always knew what I wanted and what I felt (fi) but then i got scared that I didnt see the other peoples perspective. I idealized some Fe users and wanted to be like them and imitated how they acted towards others.   
However supressing myself and my own needs also proved to be quite bad, so nowadays I use a hopefully healthy mix of my strong Fi and my learned Fe when dealing with others."
6509,I,N,F,P,Whatever gave you that idea.
6510,I,N,F,P,"Honesty is the way to go. But I always hate turning someone down regardless. I want to make sure they know that they are great people and that there is someone worthy for them out there, just that I'm not the person capable of being that."
6511,I,N,F,P,this
6512,I,N,F,P,and suddenly the show turns into prison break >->
6513,I,N,F,P,"I'm completely fine with it, since I see all our strengths and I'm on my way to developing them to the best of my ability.In fact the only thing that annoys me about my type is other INFPs saying our type sucks or other types stereotyping us as selfish, suicidal emos with unicorns and rainbows in their heads.But then again I don't relate all to much with fictional INFPs either. It seems like INFP-As are either too rare or are seen as a different type altogether when they do appear."
6514,I,N,F,P,"Exactly. Once you find out that YOUR priorities aren't everyone elses priorities life gets a whole lot more complicated and scary, but you also understand it way more."
6515,I,N,F,P,Exactly what I thought.
6516,I,N,F,P,Hm... I prefer the INTJ way.
6517,I,N,F,P,Never stay in an enviroment that isn't good for you. Looking for a different job before you leave the current one is probably the best option.
6518,I,N,F,P,so rather agnostic?
6519,I,N,F,P,"Sometimes its okay to trust your intuition a little and go for what you are feeling is right. We INFPs try to supress that part a lot since rationality is making us loose grip on the world that cant be seen by the human eye.   
Dont blame yourself for it though if you doubt your intuition. Its hard in a world that values facts and evidence to follow a feeling in this sort of way."
6520,I,N,F,P,"I would have been more worried if you didn't cry.   
Its a natural response of losing someone you love. You will never be fully prepared for it."
6521,I,N,F,P,It depends on the topic of conversation.
6522,I,N,F,P,Relateable. Hope you can get out of that toxic situation soon.
6523,I,N,F,P,"Wow this is a very coldhearted, simple-minded and stupid topic to talk about.  


There is only one answer for this: It depends on the individuals involved.   


Sheesh"
6524,I,N,F,P,That depends on how highly developed the ENTJs Fi is.
6525,I,N,F,P,...will the introverts be allowed to hide in their room?
6526,I,N,F,P,we dont fight friends \^\^ You would have to be a real evil person and step on our morals or threaten our loved ones for us to turn on the demon side.
6527,I,N,F,P,"It means that YOU are the one who has much to learn, obviously."
6528,I,N,F,P,"Hate is just pain caused by having wanted to love someone, but be disappointed deeply instead."
6529,I,N,F,P,jesus christ.
6530,I,N,F,P,I have a feeling its the other way around.
6531,I,N,F,P,too vulgar. But I see why you think that.
6532,I,N,F,P,"I can actually be sarcastic and witty around certain kinds of people. Mostly certain friends of mine. We can have entire conversations with sarcasm and people around us might even think we are fighting when we have the time of our life, lol.But like i said, it needs to be a conversation partner, who understands me and who I am.Not everyone fits in that category and I hate when strangers assume they can tease and make jokes about me right from the get go. Hell no my friend, you cant. You have to earn that spot. I dont care if you think I'm sensitive. I'm not on board with this. Sincerely an INFP-A"
6533,E,N,T,P,It's interesting how close the Dover Demon is to the Wendigo. It's almost as if they're the same cryptid.
6534,E,N,T,P,Reminds me of Farcry 5
6535,E,N,T,P,I get a similar effect on Dexedrine. A few people have asked me if I'm prescribed benzos on days when my Dexedrine is having a particularly calming effect. That being said it can also make me anxious or wired on other days so it's a bit unpredictable.
6536,E,N,T,P,"Caffeine doesn't really make me feel foggy. More so just extremely scattered and unfocused. It absolutely fucks my working memory, mainly because it's difficult to hold on to thoughts for any significant amount of time when your that scattered."

6538,E,N,T,P,"I've gotten voted off as crewmate on numerous locations for forgetting where I was when the body was found. I tend to do all my tasks in autopilot while trying to get a feel for who's sus, so I typically just end up zoning out until a body is found."

Sometimes I'm dead silent, mostly just going on long rants and tangents inside my head while frantically pacing around the apartment when I need to feed the Ne, but if you really manage to get me going I can talk your fucking ear off."

6544,E,N,T,P,That's something else I thought of. Specifically speed comedowns.
6545,E,N,T,P,I used to like caffeine but I had to quit it to reduce anxiety on Adderall. Now even off of Adderall I'd try to reduce my caffeine consumption. Quiting caffeine actually gave me far more control over my mind. Caffeine absolutely fucks my productivity and exacerbates my ADHD scatterbrain. Whereas amph increases productivity and mental clarity.
6546,E,N,T,P,Your definitely right about the supplements. Rhodiola saved my ass the first few times I took abrupt tolerance breaks from Dex.
6547,E,N,T,P,Install Arch with a minimalist tiling window manager if you really want smoothness.
6548,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, anxiety is a huge issue for me with medication. It's the main reason why I switched to Dexedrine. I had previously tried Vyvanse which is still better than Adderall but oddly enough caused more anxiety than straight up Dexedrine. Overall while I still get a fair bit of anxiety on the amphs, they're still that better than the phenidates. Concerta was the first medication I was prescribed, followed by Zoloft , Wellbutrin, low dose ability, Adderall, Vyvanse, and finally Dexedrine. Concerta was just pure muscle tension in a pill with little to no focus or mood boost. I actually felt a slight soreness in my muscles after it wore off. On top of that it completely scattered my mind. Amphs can occasionally have similar effects but not too often. And with amphs hydrating and keeping your electrolytes up will usually negate most side effects.

On a completely different note I've noticed that cutting down on liquid sugar intake can reduce amph related anxiety and heart palpitations.

A lot of side effects can be remedied by life style changes. If I don't piss off my body I can typically keep my heart rate at around 80bpm while medicated, but if I piss my body off it can jump to around 130bpm and stay there for a few hours."
6549,E,N,T,P,Pretty poggers ngl. 😳

6555,E,N,T,P,"Thanks, this is actually really helpful. I've been holding off on art and honestly a lot of other hobbies I've been wanting to pick up because I fear that I wont be in the perfect headspace. I've just been sitting around waiting for the right headspace to arrive when I could be actively improving regardless. Other times I worry that I'm ""Not inspired enough"" at a given time and thus don't deserve to express myself until I feel ""Truly inspired"" again. 

Hearing this is honestly liberating."
6556,E,N,T,P,I could feel every vessel in my brain starting to hemorrhage.
6557,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, started with contamination OCD for me when I was first diagnosed. Or  more so the contamination obsession was what led to my diagnoses as it was the most noticeably limiting. Luckily most of my obsessions since have been far more brief and less severe. Rumination still fucks me over big time though. I feel as if OCD fundamentally changes your way of thinking, beyond just the obvious symptoms. Even when not dealing with any one particular set of obsessions or compulsions I'm plagued by overthinking. Feels like people rarely ever talk about the negative thought loops that leave you questioning everything or constantly looking for reassurance."
6558,E,N,T,P,"I've definitely seen a lot of the first description. Haven't seen much of the second in media though. Honestly wish we could just get a more accurate depiction of OCD, and honestly other anxiety disorders in general. They could at least sit down and talk to someone with OCD when writing so they could actually develop an understanding of the disorder rather than just regurgitating the common clichés."

6609,I,N,F,P,"Yes I totally understand but from what I've seen Taylor Nation has constantly been advertising items exclusive to US and it sucks because shipping prices are way too high and it's almost impossible to buy even regular merch not to mention she doesn't even tour here!! So naturally this was brought to the attention of Taylor Nation but since they turn a blind eye US swifties have been helping us out on their own volition. 

Now the ones you really have to be angry at are the greedy resellers who buy the exclusive stuff and resell it at 200 times the original price."
6610,I,N,F,P,Damn so jealous. I really wish she would come to India
6611,I,N,F,P,Um why is everyone down voting? Am I missing something?
6612,I,N,F,P,Whenever I get a talkative driver I find that 90 percent of the times they're the ones that try to scam me. Weird.
6613,I,N,F,P,Literally my situation right now 😭
6614,I,N,F,P,Aw :(
6615,I,N,F,P,They're doing it for the international fans.
6616,I,N,F,P,Thank you for the downloads! Being an international fan really sucks. I bought the merch with the digital album because I thought they weren't selling it without the digital download. Only later I found out that you can buy it separately 😞. Could have saved a few bucks but oh well. Oh and happy cake day!! 🎂
6617,I,N,F,P,What 😂😂😂
6618,I,N,F,P,I wasn't planning on it lol
6619,I,N,F,P,It's my favorite too 😭

6622,I,N,F,P,How about a hug? 🤗
6623,I,N,F,P,">In my last post I mentioned setting up your own personal metrics for success.

This! We always seek external validation which are not in our control most of the times. We need to set our own standards of success because that is one thing which we can control. For example getting accepted or rejected in a job interview is not in your hands because that depends on the employer. All you need to worry about is if you have successfully completed that interview by your standards which you have set for yourself."

6627,I,N,F,P,"I'm not Black, I'm Indian but I just wanted to say this seems like a very cool idea! I'd love to hear your take on exile"
6628,I,N,F,P,"They ask you to call them by their preferred pronouns because they go through gender dysphoria not out of condescension. I understand you have other mental issues as well but honestly shouldn't you know better? I agree that you can't force the people around you to cater to your needs but we're human beings. Even if you think you don't get affected by it, you will be because that's how we are from a psychological point of view. It's foolish to assume that you're immune to this even if you have mental issues or not. It's basic empathy. 

If you want to refute this just ask yourself, if it was so simple then why is it so difficult and why do you struggle so much with these mental issues. If getting out of addiction was so simple wouldn't everyone be able to do it? Obviously there should be a personal accountability but it is extremely hard without external help. 

That's the reason it's a crime if you abet a suicide. If you goad a person into killing himself, who's to blame? The suicidal person? Because he was too weak to defend himself? 

The point is, it doesn't kill you to be kind. I kinda agree that toxic people do exist in the LGBTQ community but I implore you to have an open mind."
6629,I,N,F,P,"The parallel between her wanting to escape to nature away from the internet and technology is perfectly expressed by the jarring tone of those modern words in a poetic song. It's deliberate and it makes you ""hate"" the words and you want to go back to listening to the poetic lyrics. I think it's a clever addition"
6630,I,N,F,P,"Yes! I could relate to reputation because of what I was going through in my life at the time and it's the same reason I don't like Lover because I couldn't relate to finding a secure relationship like Taylor talks about in Lover. Hopefully one day I'll come back to this album when things are going great in my life and think ""Wow I totally relate to this"""

If i am bla bla, would i act like a bla bla in X situation? How does other bla bla people act? Do they think as a bla bla or something else? I remember Hawking was bla bla too lol.

6693,E,S,T,J,I relate to the willpower of my 7 wing but I’m not the most optimistic person. I’m more of a realistic “can do” person. My 7 wing shows up more in my fear of missing out and wanting to experience life to the fullest and accomplish as much as possible.

6706,E,S,T,J,My 7 wing really care out during this quarantine because I have a constant fear of missing out on college activities I did last semester. I also have been budding heads with my 1w2 dad and 2w1 mom a lot living home again. I’m able to concentrate on school work more but I miss the college environment and having control of my own schedule.

6730,E,S,T,J,He simps for Cleo who just manipulates him when it’s convenient for her. He ignores Joan and is a jerk to JFK when he accidentally kills Mario.
6731,E,S,T,J,Stop making all these mean comments...I can’t stop upvoting them 😂
6732,E,S,T,J,"I get mistyped as an ENTJ a lot because of my strong Ne. I definitely focus of the present and think more practically but I’m terrible at memorizing details. (If I’m learning a song, I pick up the repeated pattern/structure but I have trouble learning the words.) I also don’t relate to a lot of the “traditional” stereotypes but my cognitive functions best match ESTJ. I actually joined r/ENTJ and participate in some of the discussions since they’re fellow Te-doms and a lot of them share the same enneagram as me. (8w7)"
6733,E,N,F,P,"I came up with these from my observations. I never said Fe lacked morals or is less genuine. I said first Fi is more genuine with actions and Fe with goals and then I said Fi users are more predictable even if they have **BAD** morals. I said all people have the faculty of being caring, now I add all people can have good or bad morals too, regardless of type. Also I'm not talking in absolutes just what one type is more likely to do then another.

 What I mean by this genuinity thing is let's say you are hanging out with a group friends, you like them and want to make them happy and have a good time (goal) but you are at this moment pissed off or depressed by something, would you ignore your feelings and correct your actions for the group's sake? An Fi user will find it harder then a Fe user  to betray their own emotions so it will be *action* genuine and an Fe user is more ready to follow their goal and tuning their emotions in correspondance to group, in align with having a good time with friends, more social *goal* genuine. I think a better concept for this is the original jungian subjective vs objective but I think action vs goal is a nice alternative way to present it"
6734,E,N,F,P,"they are important and a good heuristic but qualifications or a fancy title alone shouldn't matter for scientific process. Also what type of poeple do you think pays scientist or academic institutions? benevolent and altruistic companies? morally virtuous politicians? do you think they would pay/ them if they say the products they sell damage consumer health/mind or the enviroment? or challange their position in power? maybe yes if it gives more disadvanges to their competition. Ignoring politics influence in academia and how they control the course of scientific progress is a delusional mistake. I don't say all sciencitific endeavour is biased but in the real world there are sure a heavy influence from interest conflicts. 

I know what you mean. I believe your average 'science deniers' are clowns too, but so do scientifism leaning people and positivists who blindly believe in science and the word of their authorities without giving in any thought. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that if you aren't following science authorities then that means you're a stupid like ignorant sciencie deniers, don't fall for that dichotomy"
6735,E,N,F,P,"I agree, english is not my native language so I made a mistake haha I meant 'care' as to care more of what other poeople think, like giving priority to being aware of the external emotional atmosphere, and not 'caring' as in having for default a caring or empathetic nature. I believe all people have the faculty to be caring imo.

Also I believe Fi users are more 'genuine' with actions and Fe more' genuine' with goals, that's why high Fe user can change their Ti beliefs to whatever their goals are, so they are more ready to do bad things if their goals are in line with what's necessary, fair and good TO them. Fi morals and actions are more predictable even if they are bad, they may sacrifice their goals if the actions needed to get there aren't aligned to what they feel is good or right for them."
6736,E,N,F,P,what's so scientific about not being skeptic and having faith on scientific authorities? Skepticism and trying to go out of the box are a base of scientific method
6737,E,N,F,P,well if she like you back go for it :P
6738,E,N,F,P,Love the outfit and pose!
6739,E,N,F,P,"You can't just resist it, she so hugable :9"
6740,E,N,F,P,Loooool
6741,E,N,F,P,"I agree but, what makes Fe function stronger at this is that they actually care, are interested and get stimulation from reading other people and the group. After years of habitual external observation they get very good at it. An Fi user let's say INTJ psychoanalist may be quite exceptional at reading people 1 to 1 but that's assuming by their profession they are interested in actually reading people.

In addition I think Ne-Si is better at reading familiar people you frequent and Ni-Se at reading unfamiliar people and strangers. For example an ISFP is better than INFP at knowing if an acquaintance likes them but INFP is better at reading their girlfriend/boyfriend I believe"
6742,E,N,F,P,"I have the same concern. I think as long as you don't copy everything you are okay. If you want to get inspired from natural religions I would look for patterns and recurring elements. One pattern I see is that creativity is related to the divine and life-death energies, if you are able to create an imaginary world and 'give life' to it then I think is save to say as the creator of it you have the right to be a god of that world :p"

6792,I,N,T,J,God damn
6793,I,N,T,J,"I don't think this is the same as being called out for being angry (when one isn't). Your INFJ girlfriend was asking you if you were angry, not telling you that you were. Sometimes people ask repeatedly if you're angry because they've had previous abusive/manipulative relationships. It may not have anything to do with you being too serious :)"
6794,I,N,T,J,"Honestly, I'm swamped with work but I'm intrigued... this might very well be a shit show but... let's find out..."
6795,I,N,T,J,"Well I don’t see how you’re being manipulative here. As long as you’re not passive aggressive in your day to day interactions with people, I’m fine. Though I would also say that being passive aggressive only shows that you’re weak and scared, and can do no other than take someone’s shit. The mature thing to do would be to talk it out with them so they know what they’re doing wrong. Of course, I know most INTPs are conflict averse so maybe wouldn’t be as willing to figure it out with someone, but maybe that gets improved later on in life. Not sure."
6796,I,N,T,J,I definitely have an inferiority complex lmao. I realize I’m not more intelligent than others... but perhaps more hardworking? I don’t know. Definitely something more common in INTP/INFP behaviour despite not having the same cognitive functions.
6797,I,N,T,J,"That’s a pretty self deprecating way to look at it haha. My point is that I appreciate you all whether you’re dumbasses having a smart moment, or being smartasses. This, of course, if you don’t have toxic qualities like passive aggressiveness/manipulative tendencies. 

I myself find it difficult to understand my emotions, and find it even more difficult to talk about them. Having more life experience well most definitely bring out the ability to understand your own feelings :) it’s a long process"

I definitely agree with the apparent differences between INTP and INTJs. My good friend/old teacher and I had a shared interest in a topic and had very different reasons for why we were interested in that topic. We would also come to drastically different conclusions on how to solve a specific issue. I just always found my old teacher’s thinking so fascinating. 

As for attraction—I think that once I’ve established a friendship with an INTP, there’s no chance of that friendship developing into anything else. But if I had a fling with an INTP right off the bat, that’s the only way an INTP wouldn’t be in the friend zone lol"

I've always avoided SSRIs, because pretty much everone I know who's taken them stopped taking them due to the nasty side-effects.

Wellbutrin seems better, especially since it doesn't just impact my mood but also improves ADD-like symptoms & physical energy.

i'm currently on a Wellbutrin (an NDRI) prescription to help me recover from burnout and depression. And while the Wellbutrin does have somewhat of a positive effect on my mood, my ADD-like symptoms as well as my physical energy levels, I did struggle with insomnia until I started talking a melatonin supplement and still struggle with almost daily headaches.

Based on the limited research I've done so far, phenylpiractam seems to have a similar effect on mind and body, but with more positives and less negatives. Hence I'm wondering if phenylpiractam could be a suitable alternative to Wellbutrin."

I've been taking Wellbutrin for a couple of weeks now. It's not an SSRI, but an NDRI. That means it inhibits the reuptake of dopamine through the human dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter.

It does help stabilize my mood when I get really sad and cry. It also helps alleviate my ADD-like symptoms and gives ma a bit more physical energy. 

I wouldn't say it makes me feel ""normal"", though. I feel better than I did before, but I'm still struggling with depression and the Wellbutrin does kind of make me feel a bit like a different person, due to various subtle changes to my metabolism."

Yes.

I'm sure you know that the Russian revolution of 1917 was founded by Wall Street bankers.

> No need to reduced the population. 

The most efficient way to make life on this planet more sustainable, is a drastic reduction of the number of people on this planet, in combination with more sustainable methods of industry & farming.

6881,I,N,T,P,">Why would the elites want to reset everything?

To reduce the global population in a predictable, controlled and orderly fashion?

To shift from a carbon fuel based capitalist economy to a renewable energy based quasi-community economy in a predictable, controlled and orderly fashion?

[This is the official reason](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/) the World Economic Forum is giving. They literally call it ""the great reset"".

Another term they've been using is ""The Fourth Industrial Revolution"". [Here's a book](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-Klaus-Schwab/dp/1524758868) written by the head of the World Economic Forum, with that same title!

FYi, the World Economic Forum, in case you don't know them, those are the people organizing those annual meetings at Davos. They split from the Bilderberg Group a few decades ago and seem to have been heavily involved in social engineering during the last decade!

6932,I,N,T,P,-3.5
6933,I,N,T,P,Puppets are really weak heroes.  They're really just used as food for another character's awakening or enhancement.
6934,I,N,T,P,I didn't even realize this game had been around that long.
6935,I,N,T,P,"If you miss the opportunity to trade-in your event items, does anyone know if they're typically usable in the next year's version of that event, or if you can only sell them?"
6936,I,N,T,P,"Tablets, on the other hand...do they let you turn the tablet vertical in this game?  You could probably fit all of this on an iPad."
6937,I,N,T,P,"I love the look of it, though I'm guessing it would be smaller to fit on phone screens.  For instance, I have a Galaxy Note 9, and I had to zoom back to 75% to get this small enough for it to horizontally fit the screen dimensions when I put my phone to my monitor.  This is still one of the larger phone screens around though, so people without flagship devices are gonna have some horizontal scroll or further zoomback...and if it gets too small the buttons get a little unruly.

It's still a far better setup for quickly modifying a bunch of your team than what we've got right now, but I just thought it's worth noting that it wouldn't look exactly like this on phones."
6938,I,N,T,P,"I feel like I've hardly gotten anywhere meaningful with Soul Weapons, so advancing my UWs is a lot more appealing at the moment...but they are random UWs, so I guess if I had someone's Soul Weapon I actually felt like using I could see the benefit..."
6939,I,N,T,P,I'm just curious.  Has anyone else absolutely immolated their stamina by grinding random UW tickets out of the special dungeon?
6940,I,N,T,P,"If only it were this simple.  Most of us have projects A-H and Pseudo-Projects Q through HPX49, yet we'll waste entire days watching full seasons of anime or 1-shotting video games we've already played through lol"
6941,I,N,T,P,"I mean...I can't lie and say I didn't think about doing this at one point.  If you've got giant hordes of copies of these guys and haven't gotten much of anything going with meta characters, it's kinda tempting to fuse your way into some progress on Aspen and SL instead of holding a mountain of fodder for some day way off in the future."
6942,I,N,T,P,\*groans\*
6943,I,N,T,P,"I notice in the tier lists people post, they usually rate a character's worth in League of Honor separately from League of Victory, and some characters (like Dakaris) are substantially better in one league than the other.

I thought they were effectively the same 4-v-4 combat, other than the team selection aspect.  Is there something more to the difference between the two leagues I haven't noticed, or are the separate ratings mainly showing that versatility is valued more highly in LoH since you don't get to preplan your whole team?"
6944,I,N,T,P,"I don't hate these. I appreciate the fact that they at least drill down to rate specific aspects of the game. And while they take a lot of space, they're quick to read and give substantially more info than your typical one-liner (or even single-word) reviews."
6945,I,N,T,P,"Wow, so he’s that good?  And that versatile?"
6946,I,N,T,P,"I seem to be fundamentally misunderstanding how to deal with Imet (the God King Challenge boss for Warriors/Knights).  I can barely pass the 2nd level of difficulty.

It doesn't seem like there's anyway to break him out of his skills, so the execution is rocking my world.  Is your only hope there to gear everyone up to the point where even your DPS warriors aren't killed outright by it?  So far I've only got one character who can take that hit, and he always gets hit with it last."
6947,I,N,T,P,"Good catch, his spear shoots an arrow in front of him."
6948,I,N,T,P,"Honestly, there are nearly 90k of us, with around 250 online even in the dead of night.  The vast majority seem to be completely silent.  A-hole/troll population is pretty low...though the wit level is generally high among INTPs, and there are a few who choose to unleash their snark.  But when 99% of people don't post or comment, it can seem like the ratio's a lot higher."
6949,I,N,T,P,"Well, that might make sense, but I've never done any custom rules...I always just continue."
6950,I,N,T,P,"Update:  I've died twice trying 4BC and the death counts aren't updating, neither here nor on the monster page.

Anyone else having similar issues?"
6951,I,N,T,P,"If it does, then that should throw the count in the other direction...more deaths than unfinished runs"
6952,I,N,T,P,"I'm not sure I follow...

What I'm saying is it seems weird to me that I've got 17 runs I didn't finish, but only 10 deaths.  Every run I don't finish should end with a death...unless I restart or something, I would think.

I could see if it was one off, then maybe it'd be counting the run I'm just starting.  But off by 7?"
6953,I,N,T,P,"160 hours in and the quarantine has done good things, at least in this area.

I'd hit a wall, stuck on 2BC for a long time.  On someone else's suggestion here, I started a new save in March and started over, only getting the items I'd tried so far that I actually liked and avoiding unlocking a lot of the ones I never got the hang of.  Now I get a lot more of the items in shops that I actually want to use.

I go back to the first save to try out some items I haven't added, and if I find a decent pattern that works, I take it to the main save.

Putting the Alchemic Carbine in was an immediate gamechanger.  I beat 2BC Saturday and just beat 3BC tonight with that bad boy."
6954,I,N,T,P,"Weird, maybe I need to check my settings.  I get confirmation popups on everything..."
6955,I,N,T,P,"We have a daily limit of 300 friendship points received through the exchanges, but I've never even gotten 200 with a full friends list.   Is there a trick to this I'm unaware of?  It doesn't seem to matter whether the friends come online or not..."
6956,I,N,T,P,"Just wondering, did they change something about the game on Android?  I used to pause and go to other apps, text some people, then come back and resume.  As long as I didn't wait too long to come back, everything would be fine, but if I waited too long the game would tell me so and take me back to the login screen.

For the last month or so, if I flip away for more than 30 seconds, it's like the whole app has to reload.  Is that happening for everyone, or do I need to check my settings outside the app?"
6957,I,N,T,P,"You're not disqualified from every reward...in fact you've already probably gotten a ton of them right at the beginning for your progress.  You're not even really DQ'd from these, you just can't do them right now."
6958,I,N,T,P,We're in maintenance so I haven't seen if there's a time limit.  But to me this just sounds like you need to wait for another character to come out that you haven't already purchased and level that guy.
6959,I,N,T,P,"If you're really at that point...you don't need rewards very much, do you?"
6960,I,N,T,P,"Can someone help me understand why some heroes are better for League of Honor than League of Valor?  Aren't both 4-on-4 with the same general setup?  Or is the LOH team-making factored in, given that you often won't get the exact team of 4 you want?"
6961,I,N,T,P,"Whoops, I see it now, nevermind.  Mega fail, thought that was Aida"
6962,I,N,T,P,"I'm curious. Everyone mentions Horus for this guy, but the screenshot doesn't show him with a single copy of Horus...am I missing something?"
6963,I,N,T,P,"Nice!　I just finished my first 1BC run tonight with the Lightning Whip, Quick Bow, Wolf Trap, and Fire Grenades.  Didn't manage to use the bow much, but that whip is super useful when you've got one that does good damage."
6964,I,N,T,P,"Once you have someone's 5\* UW, if you get another copy of it randomly, is grinding it pretty much the only useful option?"
6965,I,N,T,P,"Ok, so, PvE primary here.  My current DPS is a 3* UW Cleo, but I also have Lorraine(0*), Artemia(X), Erze(X), Roi(1*), Zafir (1*), Ophelia (1*) and Tanya(0*),

Is there any benefit to starting to advance one of these other characters’ weapons, or should I be all in on pushing Cleo up to 4 or 5 star turf?"
6966,I,N,T,P,"Wow, this is dope."
6967,I,N,T,P,"Any tips on Transendence Perks for Cleo?  Seems like every post I can find on the subject is from before her perks were reworked.  She's my main DPS atm, so I've got T95 to work with."
6968,I,N,T,P,"Now there's a use for Itachi's Tsukuyomi no one's mentioned...

But seriously, if you get hungry or have to pee your brain's going to tear itself apart..."
6969,I,N,T,P,LOL Win
6970,I,N,T,P,"I just made it around to my first year as a free player on here and am now repeating some events I did last year.  I've been holding on to old event currency hoping to pile it up to get something better the next time around, but I'm noticing with this Halloween event that the candy's different.  Is that a common thing with these from year to year?  Should I just sell the old stuff?"
6971,I,N,T,P,"This always made me wonder what the back end of this game is like.  They give 2 rewards when you win, the regular immediate one for fighting the boss, and another in the mail for dropping the boss.  Was it just easier to implement this way?  You'd think involving the mail system would be more impractical..."
6972,I,N,T,P,"I'm bummed, I can't achieve any one of these in this timeframe.

I thought I was going to get one when it looked like it was asking you to do 50B total damage on a world boss...but after doing it a few times and seeing the numbers not move or barely change, I realized  it means 50B in one go, and I do just over 20 at best.  \*sigh\*"
6973,I,N,T,P,"Funny, though I don't know a single INF-anything that channels this as much as the ENFPs in my circle do."
6974,I,N,T,P,">ESFP drives you crazy as a good thing or a bad thing?

YES.  lol...it's hard to explain.  It's like, there's this person that processes every experience on a completely different wavelength from me.  We have literally no cognitive functions in common, so the reasoning behind our actions gets lost in translation most of the time, unless we explicitly explain ourselves.

On the one hand, it's highly interesting and entertaining, and there's rarely a dull moment when she's around.  On the other, it's so hard to have a serious relationship when I keep having to talk things out hardcore to really get where she's coming from, and vice versa.  Because of maturity & trust we've worked through a lot of things that would've killed most friendships...but it's taken a lot of effort and kinda feels like it always will."
6975,I,N,T,P,"INTP, primarily attracted to ENFP, ENFJ, INFJ.  

Something about NFs.  But not INFP for some reason though, they feel like family and I always just stay friends with them.

And then there's that one ESFP that drives me crazy, but anyway."
6976,I,N,T,P,"For 8-man content, anyone know if this buffs the ally with highest ATK in the full 8-man vs. whoever's the highest in the same subteam as the equipper?"
6977,I,N,T,P,Do magic crystals serve any purpose beyond being ground into powder?
6978,I,N,T,P,"Hi!  So, I've got my entire group of characters to level 90, and my first 2 teams are mostly wearing T7 BD or FD armors, but I'm not really making much momentum on making them any better than that. 

We've dipped our finger into T8 gear through the repository and the T8 FD, but the T8 BD always roasts my party before we can get him below 20%.  The way everyone talks, BD8's the best gear and the only set worth really spending time on gathering and building...

Given I'm not managing to take the T8 BD down yet, do I farm the FD just to get in solid Tier 8 stuff, and work from there?  Or does anyone suggest another approach?"
6979,I,N,T,P,"Oooh, you were 3 days too soon.

This, too, is possible in the Antonio Brown zone."
6980,I,N,T,P,"Do any stats directly affect how much HP a priest’s heal spells recover?  I’ve heard heals can crit, so Crit obviously helps increase that occurrence.  But does Crit DMG matter there, improving the amount of healing on crit?  And does ATK or any other stat have any affect on the base value of their heals?

EDIT: Actually, ditto same question for shield spells like the ones Frey/Zafir/Laias have..."
6981,I,N,T,P,"Weird, mine always makes me choose between the local save and the Google one whenever there's a discrepancy on login...and often that's after spending maybe 5 minutes offline.  Yours doesn't do the same?"
6982,I,N,T,P,Gotta admit that's what I thought was being referenced at first lol
6983,E,N,T,J,Probably ENTP tbh
6984,E,N,T,J,"I grew up in fairly poor and unsafe area. My parents were working their asses off to support 3 kids, which meant I often wouldn't see my dad for weeks at a time. My older sister was an insufferable bitch (still love her) and my  brother was all over the place so alot of the time I felt like I had to be the ""leader"". Get good grades, kill the bugs, clean up, teach them, start supporting the family etc. I still remember my dad constantly telling me to keep an eye out, always take care of my family, never trust anyone until they put their neck on the line for you, keep your eyes up while walking, crying is for losers. Everything was a lesson and I became pretty abrasive because I was basically thinking ""My dad already rags at my ass nonstop so nothing you fuckers say can hurt me"". 

I'm really uncomfortable asking for help, because to me it just seems wrong somehow. I need to be able to do everything on my own and if I can't I'm somehow flawed and weak and I need to prove to myself that I'm not. Whenever there's a problem, I physically cannot ignore it, things either *are* or *aren't*. I think the trademark of being an 8 is a do or die mentality and thinking that the world is against you, but you can deal with it on your own.

By the time we moved and our standard of life improved, my brother was 8 so he got to experience birthday parties, going to a waterpark, watching movies and I'm really envious, but at the same so happy that he's having a good childhood and I almost feel proud in a way. The ""protective"" description of an 8 really resonates with me and seeing injustice just enrages me."
6985,E,N,T,J,"One thing I noticed with my ENTP brother is that he tests people to see how weird he can act without consequence. If he finds the right group he's a comedian, but otherwise he just keeps to himself."

7019,E,N,T,J,"Mbti and socionics define the functions and types very differently. Te is quite similar in both, but Se is quite different.

In mbti, Se is about interacting with concrete reality and indulging in the pleasures and experiences of it.

In socionics, Se is about exerting your influence on reality, expanding your space and applying volitional pressure through sheer will.

The LIE is a type that is strategic, decisive, rational and seeks efficiency above all else. However, they are not aggressive, rather assertive ""they manipulate the current to their advantage""

The SLE is a type that is active, energetic, analytical and aggressive in their approach to life ""They swim against the current to get what they want"". SLEs are strongly concerned with power dynamics and having control over their environment.

I'm definitely far more diplomatic and accommodating than the ENTJ stereotypes and have a very healthy relationship with him. 

Based on what I have seen with people in my life and online anecdotes. NT children always seem to have ambiguous relationships towards xSxx parents because the way they process information is just too different. Children are already supposed to clash with their parents when they start becoming independent and having different ways of processing and judging information just makes it worse."

7084,I,N,T,P,LOL I like to give every inanimate object I can names and honestly I get pretty attached to them all. Like George my PC has been my best object friend for 10 years.
7085,I,N,T,P,I agree that's why I only look at things like height as a bonus. If I have fun with someone and enjoy being around them I'm not gonna pass because of a preference.
7086,I,N,T,P,That's true I really don't get when women are like barely 5ft and need a guy that much taller. I feel like it's just shallow at that point :/
7087,I,N,T,P,"I think abs are attractive because it shows they put a lot of work in on their body but not showing any of those emotions but anger is one of the most unattractive things to me. Any kind of emotional experience turns into anger and they become so emotionally stupid they can't even figure out what to do when I'm having a hard time but get angry. 

I think that's just the stereotypical 'real man' but most of the time in my experience no one actually wants that kind of guy, I definitely don't."
7088,I,N,T,P,I'm fairly tall so I'd rather a guy I'm dating be at least my height but that's just my preference. If someone doesn't like me because of my height or weight or whatever that's fine too. I don't owe anyone anything and no one owes me anything.

For the shading, I would advise avoiding shading with black/ grey or a dark version of the color. Rather, try experimenting with other dark colors! For exemple, instead of using grey or dark beige for her skin, you could use a light brown, it will give more fun and life to your drawing!( ◠‿◠ ) 

Some colors are unexpected, for exemple, I never knew that I could use yellow to put light on green! Or sometimes purple for fair skin...
There are guides that can help you choose!

7183,I,N,F,J,"As someone who has taken the latter option, I can tell you that the pain does get better with time. Reaching out and building a better support system is the hardest part. I got lucky with mine. My car broke down and one of my work friends was my ride for several months. We opened up to each other a lot and got really close. Guy's now one of my best friends despite a few depression cycles that had me questioning his motives for hanging out with me. I now have a group of friends and acquaintances that I hang out with fairly regularly at a local arcade.

Point I'm trying to make here is that leaving the detrimental ones behind gives you a lot more room for people you genuinely want to be around and have your best interest at heart, and it makes it easier to steer clear of the ones who don't without feeling guilty about it."

7205,I,N,F,J,"It's a relief to know I'm not alone in that one. I started getting suspicious when I began to notice boxes of canned goods and fruit cups and whatnot in her room. They looked like they'd been packed and shipped by somebody but she'd get testy if I asked about it. After she officially left, I checked the cans she left and sure enough they came from the state I know her most loyal flying money lives. Blows my mind that he believed any of it since he knows we have a grocery store right across the street and she used to brag about ordering her groceries in her last places so she didn't have to leave the house."

Poor kid is seen sobbing and begging them to turn the camera off and leave him alone in multiple videos. He's covered in bruises in most of them. The way the stepmom talks about him is disconnected and dismissive.

Thankfully the kid and his bio sister were taken away and live with their bio family members after Phillip DeFranco shined a spotlight on them. The videos are viscerally upsetting.."
7207,I,N,F,J,I'd like to direct your attention to DaddyOFive...who still has a fucking platform that he whines on about how much of a victim him and his family are due to being busted for the shameless child abusers him and his wife are.

7211,I,N,F,J,"She told people I was starving her and expecting sexual favors out of her to live with me.

The truth was I would ask her if she needed anything every time I got groceries and she made her own money so she could have easily gotten them herself, and I hadn't made any sexual advances on her in months because she made it clear she wasn't interested. She'd been intimately frozen toward me for a long time. The sexual favors thing was exactly what she'd said about the last guy she'd been living with to get me to want to ""save"" her. From what I witnessed with how she talked to other men, I'm pretty sure she convinced every guy she complained to me about that she genuinely wanted to be with them, only to turn around and act like that was never true and they were overstepping her boundaries. 

Not to mention the fact that she was a literal raging alcoholic that physically attacked me on multiple occasions. She did it while I was streaming with her one day, but she made sure to wait until we were out of the cam's sight to shove me. I turned around and shoved her off me (I'd warned her several times that I was going to start fighting back if she didn't stop getting physical with me) and she immediately ran back to her chat and told her flying monkeys that I was refusing to leave her room and had shoved her for no reason.

I think she was legit psychotic on top of the BPD."
7212,I,N,F,J,"When I committed to healing and getting deep into the grittiness of it all, I lost my entire friend circle and my incredibly toxic, manipulative partner. But it gave me room to breathe without those toxic expectations, and because of that, I was able to reach out and focus on people who genuinely care about me and have my best interest at heart.

I promise it gets better. If these people are leaving, it's a good thing."
7213,I,N,F,J,Again with the squeaky shoes...
7214,I,N,F,J,"My first one would scream at me and eventually upgraded to intentionally cornering me in rooms or literal corners so I couldn't get away from her. She would intentionally induce panic attacks. I never swung at her, but I did hit her car dashboard one day because one of her go tos was locking me in her vehicle while we were out driving and force me into a fight. The one day I made contact with her, she'd been screaming at me nonstop for a good while, had me cornered on the couch against a wall (the couch was at a weird angle so I had no way out other than to attempt to climb over the back of the couch) so I finally reached forward to push her away from me so I could get by. She immediately jumped up and started screaming ""YOU ASSAULTED ME!!"" over and over at the top of her lungs. My hand barely brushed her arm. She kept saying she wanted the neighbors to call the police so she could tell them what a piece of shit I was.

Her kicking me out on the street several months later was the best thing she ever did for me."

7218,I,N,F,J,"One of my best friends and I spent a few weeks actively trying to dream share back in high school. We had a couple of potentials but no real proof until one night..

I remember the dreamscape seemed to be collided and mixed together. There were messy sections of familiar elements that made no sense in their locations and didn't flow smoothly. I went into a small house that didn't feel like part of my dreamscape. There was an old crone in the house and she told me my friend was going to be moving to a specific town about a half hour from where we currently lived. I woke up feeling upset that she didn't tell me, which was unusual since I always recognize when I've been dreaming and don't have real-world emotional reactions to them.

Later that day I brought it up to her, and she told me she was going to tell me that day that her dad had gotten a job in that town and they were planning to move. The job ended up falling through and so did the move. Still one of the trippiest things we've ever experienced."

7226,I,N,F,J,"I'm glad you said this. I've found myself catching intense feelings for a woman that's mutuals with several work friends. She flirts with me very heavily every time we all group up (a bunch of us hang at the local arcades a lot), is very physically affectionate, and likes having me close to her. She's told me she's emotionally unavailable, and I figured it was because of some personal stuff she was going through that I was aware of.

Last time we met up, she escalated to a more playfully sexual form of affection. I didn't mind it. I love how she touches me and messes with me, but toward the end of the night she hugged me and told me to stop flirting with her. That even though she loved being snuggly with me, she'd break my heart eventually. I don't want to believe her, but I know how this cycle has gone in the past.."
7227,I,N,F,J,"I do this too. I put on a show when I sleep and keep it low enough that I can just barely hear it so my overactive mind has something else to focus on. If I have to clean or have stuff I need to do around my place that I find difficult, I'll put either music or a playlist of my favorite YouTube channels on my phone. It really helps."

7243,I,N,F,J,"I’m a big fan of keeping up the RP in our campaigns. I tend to play more outgoing characters because most people I play with are new or quiet, so over time I adjust my character’s personality to their needs and expectations. It’s tough to be the only one driving it though, especially if there’s another experienced player at the table who treats it like a video game. I’m playing with some newbies now, and we’ve had some great moments but I’ve definitely lowered my expectations on RP. 

Hopefully one day I can play a quieter, more serious character and someone else can be the really outgoing one."
7244,I,N,F,J,"Plus she loves music, so I’m sure she’d be inspired by a few major icons."
7245,I,N,F,J,"Because every campaign I play in just rushes through lvls 1 and 2 as quickly as possible, I’ve concluded I’d rather just start at lvl 3. It always felt a little arbitrary in my experience."
7246,I,N,F,J,That’s an awesome idea!
7247,I,N,F,J,"Man, I have been there. Feeling ineffective in combat sucks."
7248,I,N,F,J,I felt the same way. To be fair I think a lot of campaigns begin that way. It can take a while to feel out one’s character and learn how to improvise with other new characters/ players. And then of course a character’s goals can change over time as well.
7249,I,N,F,J,I’m calling it now that Ashley plays a bard. She seems to really enjoy the heavy metal harp playing.

7252,I,N,F,J,"Can confirm. I usually play an outgoing character because the other players I’m with are pretty quiet, so I made a tiefling and lo and behold I’m a mix between Jester and Molly. I’m trying to to change it, but it’s so hard not to be a goof to entertain myself when everyone is so quiet."
7253,I,N,F,J,"I just finished playing in a DiA campaign. I went in blind and played as a rogue as well. I still don’t know what type of character it’s asking for, but I really wished my DM would’ve told me a little more about it beforehand so I could make a more effective character."
7254,I,N,F,J,Oh wow that’s on the nose. Not even therapy got me to that conclusion.
7255,I,N,F,J,And don’t forget the awkward eye contact with someone across the room just because you looked away from your computer for a second
7256,I,N,F,J,"Being honest is so important. I was an office PA on a show that required tons of driving and to stay late (like 2-3am) a few nights in a row. The producer stressed that if I felt tired to go home or even take a nap in the office first. I never thought I'd need it until I did, and they were very understanding. Driving while drowsy is no joke!"
7257,I,N,F,J,I actually felt this one! Usually I’m driving
7258,I,N,F,J,Yay! Spooky dice for my spooky witch DnD character!
7259,I,N,F,J,I’ve known a few people who have gone through improv and they learned a lot very quickly. Go for it!
7260,I,N,F,J,Don’t forget the romantic tension between Aussie mouse and Bianca
7261,I,N,F,J,"My best advice is that there's more than one way to skin a cat-- that is, it's possible to achieve both in a variety of ways. Plenty of TV writers and producers were/are actors. However, *each* career is a full-time job. And not just a full-time job-- you'll probably be working on a show at least 60 hours per week and trying to book auditions.

It's good that you're open to a lot of different opportunities. Save up before you get out here so it gives you time to network. Once you get to know others and perhaps work on a couple shows, you'll have a better idea of what you really want to pursue. Most people I've worked with found their right fit after working in different departments.

I wish I could give more advice about acting. Maybe someone else can give more insight in that regard. Best of luck to you!"
7262,I,N,F,J,"""Are we the baddies?"""
7263,I,N,F,J,How about the Rescuers Down Under!
7264,I,N,F,J,"This is awesome! Animation as an art form is underrated in the Hollywood entertainment industry. I have a lot of respect for people trying to do something new (or in this case, so old that it's new)."
7265,I,N,F,J,"I have a feeling that's just Martin Short's personality. Love the actor, though."
7266,I,N,F,J,"It is good, but it unfortunately flopped at the box office. The theory is that it was prohibitively expensive to make and already had a sequel in the works. Disney let the film flop so that they didn't have to pay for a sequel. That's how I understand it, anyway.

But the animation is beautiful. I personally love the mixture of 2-D and CG animation. It's a perfect adventure film. So is Atlantis: The Lost Empire, in my opinion."
7267,I,N,F,J,"Yep! And sometimes there can be multiple party faces depending on the situation. For example, the barbarian may speak up more when encountering another herd of barbarians. The rogue might be better at forging alliances with a criminal network. They could be a silver-tongued bard or an intimidating paladin. There are many possibilities to explore."
7268,I,N,F,J,"A face character refers to being the “face” of a party, meaning the one usually most involved in diplomacy, negotiation, and forging positive alliances with other characters. These characters are usually, but not always, charismatic."
7269,I,N,F,J,I’m playing a charismatic wizard with a gambling problem. She’s good at haggling for spell components and flirts to get her way. I based her off of Faye Valentine. She’s very fun to play!
7270,I,N,F,J,Californian here. Are there any future prospects for mayor people are hoping for?
7271,I,N,F,J,"This is a superb value statement and model I would like to see more media companies follow. As a TV professional, I hope more productions incorporate these ideas for a positive workplace and viewer experience."
7272,I,N,F,J,Physical items like newspapers are such a fun treat!
7273,I,N,F,J,Rough as in bad? I would love to be in an RP-heavy group. My group as of now interacts with NPCs like they’re video game characters.
7274,I,N,F,J,I admire this. I’d love to be able to play a bard with irl musical abilities!
7275,I,N,F,J,"Interesting! I’m a creative writer and usually end up as a face character, probably because I enjoy prodding and exploring the extent of the world. I’m also usually the confidant of my friends so I use that to get others to open up their characters."
7276,I,N,F,J," Not a DM yet, but man do I feel myself becoming one."
7277,I,N,F,J,"That’s great! If I’d known I wanted to go into film at the time, I definitely would’ve picked a school with a decent film program. It’s awesome you know what you want to do early on and you’re proactive to find something that suits your needs. That’s a step in the right direction! Best of luck"
7278,I,N,F,J,... I got better
7279,I,N,F,J,Not to mention the Disney super fans who already police the guests.
7280,I,N,F,J,"I got a BA in in writing at a non-film school and have worked with people of all stripes. I've seen people with BA's in marketing, theater, visual arts, fashion, English, accounting, biochemistry, and no degree at all. And none of these people work in departments you'd expect. In the trenches of production, nobody cares about where you went to school or what you got your degree in.

However, getting a degree of some kind is helpful, just don't break your back with insane loans if you can avoid it."
7281,I,N,F,J,"A stuntman on a show I worked on lives in Colorado but is established enough to get calls from LA for roles (he plays a lot of CGI characters, like robots) . Now that's the life."
7282,I,N,F,J,"In addition to what a lot of others have said, I would suggest taking a year to save money before moving to LA. Now is the perfect time to build up a savings so when the industry is in full swing again you have something to sustain you while you network. Also, networking typically requires a lot of in-person contact whether through cocktail parties, seminars, or other similar events, and those valuable resources won't pick up for quite a while, or at least not at the same capacity.

I had a similar urge to move to NYC before we knew everything would shut down, but now I see it as an opportunity to save more before I take the leap, and that is if I don't get an opportunity I love here that's worth the trade-off in the meantime.

Don't worry-- you're not missing much right now. Try Colorado since you're there and perhaps in a year or two you'll know if you want to stay. If you haven't noticed, the pattern in this thread is people don't tend to *love* LA as much as other cities (and I am one of them), so enjoy it while you're there."
7283,E,N,F,P,"Hubby is annoying, but I've literally never heard of hubster before and it's hilarious"
7284,E,N,F,P,How is being lesbian political? It's just an orientation ideally all orientations would be completely removed from politics and not matter
7285,E,N,F,P,"I'll admit I don't really understand the ins and outs of NB, but what's wrong with saying straight? I mean if you're not cool with that word just say ""I'm attracted to men/women etc.) ?"
7286,E,N,F,P,"Eh not all of them irl, the online edgelords though? Sure"
7287,E,N,F,P,Jim is a prick lol
7288,E,N,F,P,This must be what deafheaven were screaming about
7289,E,N,F,P,I'll give you some! Just you might not actually want it :(
7290,E,N,F,P,This is a cool format! Where did you get the questions from? Might have to yoink them and use them myself lol
7291,E,N,F,P,Just skimmed it but getting strong Fe vibes so Xs/nfj
7292,E,N,F,P,But I like using the whamjam clean for sparkly and wibbly sounds :'(
7293,E,N,F,P,"There's no such thing as a shitty ThinkPad, don't body shame the thicc ones and don't be ableist against the slow ones >:("
7294,E,N,F,P,Feeling enfj vibes for some reason
7295,E,N,F,P,"Fan noise won't be an issue, it'll more be the electrical interference from being near a laptop in the first place causing a buzzy squeaky sound. So you need to get the mic away from the laptop anyways"
7296,E,N,F,P,Lol those guitar's weewees are small hahahaha
7297,E,N,F,P,"Yeah this is true that they had a lot of influence back then but there's other factors in it. First is that huge technological leaps were made in the way music was recorded which also accounts for why a lot of poorly recorded bands sound overly pristine and plastic. Second is it's just not sustainable for one genre to stay dominant forever it's just times changed. A lot of the most aggressive and batshit rock has been recorded in the past two decades. Just obviously not in the mainstream, but I don't know why you'd expect big label artists not to be overly polished and safe"
7298,E,N,F,P,"Classic centrist can't handle anything outside of the status quo lol. Sure they're overrated but that's because no band could live up to the amount of hype that get. No idea what you're on about with pussified the last 12 years, they haven't really been a straight rock band since the 90s. What are some bands that aren't pussified?"
7299,E,N,F,P,It's ok baby 🥺🥺🥺. Send me some Kim wexler feet pics and I'll forgive you
7300,E,N,F,P,"Gotta be careful, don't want a toasted sandwich 😳😳"
7301,E,N,F,P,Don't body shame you pig
7302,E,N,F,P,Because it's a very reasonable assumption considering how most people act. Good on you if you don't
7303,E,N,F,P,"But in their minds they voted for loving the kitten and giving it some milk and tasty fish! Point is you need them on side, so maybe don't berate them for their past choices but highlight why they need to change their future choices. Because let's be honest, the current strategy of ""ewwww fuck all the Brexit pigs"" isn't really working and only causes them to stick their heads further down into the sand"
7304,E,N,F,P,"Tbf, it's literally not what they voted for. They simply voted to leave the eu, they didn't vote for how. Just because they're misinformed and dumb doesn't make them malicious"
7305,E,N,F,P,"I think there might be a way to get a certain amount for free, but can't remember how"
7306,E,N,F,P,Oh no worries! Still super useful to know!!
7307,E,N,F,P,Wait is that in all black or just coffee? Thanks :)
7308,E,N,F,P,"No bro, you don't get it bro, he's actually raping the incels that harass women bro, he's like a sick twisted superhero bro"
7309,E,N,F,P,I'd say 80% of the girls I've been with made the first move because I'm big dumb dumb lol
7310,E,N,F,P,"Wait, all black has caffeine in? Lol that would explain why I don't feel as great after black than normal haha"
7311,E,N,F,P,"Don't know if this is the dumb question, but is it caffeine free?? Would love to try it, but drink my huel an hour or two before I go to bed, so obvs a no go if not"
7312,E,N,F,P,*bonk* go to horny jail 😡
7313,E,N,F,P,"Well exactly, it doesn't matter who started the norms, it's that everyone plays a part in prolonging them so you need to be self reflective to see if you are yourself. That's literally what I've been saying, it's a society problem"
7314,E,N,F,P,Doesn't matter who established it as they are long dead and thus not relevant to today. What I'm saying is that both genders feed into it. A lot of men don't want to relearn anything as outside of certain circles you're going to get a lot of flack for it. That's what I'm saying you can't properly combat it without seeing how each gender contributes towards it. I'd honestly say men are shamed as much if not more by women for not being stoic emotional brick walls which in turn leads to the toxic behaviour of those men. Gotta be holistic which is why I say it's a society issue not a men issue
7315,E,N,F,P,"Right there deffo are systematic issues, but they're upheld by society in general don't know why you'd lump that all on men when there are many many women upholding the problematic status quo as well"
7316,E,N,F,P,"Well that means you are personally attracted to toxic personality traits. Don't know your type so just gonna throw this out as an example, but loads of built gym guys can be sweethearts as much as some of them can be dicks. Like you need to work out why you are attracted to these toxic personalities and try to spot and avoid them in the future"
7317,E,N,F,P,"I get the feeling a lot of people here are young and can't separate their personal dating experiences from general population. If I were to base my evaluation of women on the ones I've dated then I'd end up saying that all women are cold and shallow, but that's just the ones I've dated as I subconsciously choose that type, I've met plenty of other great women just haven't dated them"
7318,E,N,F,P,"Just swooping in here to say it's kinda a fucked up attitude to attribute sexuality to personality. Plenty of bi and gay dudes subscribe to traditional masculinity and vice versa. The most feminine and progressive dudes I personally know are 100% straight. This kind of attitude feeds into a ""us Vs them"" mentality and can also lead to the fetishisation of bi people which is not cool"
7319,E,N,F,P,"I looked at this quickly and was like cool, but then I looked closer and was like oh COOL"
7320,E,N,F,P,How did he come up with it?
7321,E,N,F,P,"Two bonks is too much, maybe just have one slightly harder bonk?"
7322,E,N,F,P,"I just do new standard by raising the high e and B string instead, doesn't need a different string gauges"
7323,E,N,F,P,"Don't know why you're being downvoted, it is bizarre how a lot on the left don't realise that they are fed propaganda in their echo chambers the same way the right are (although maybe to a slightly lesser extent)"
7324,E,N,F,P,I had to make a better database as part of my into to databases unit for undergrad lol
7325,E,N,F,P,Metropolitan also has a lot of issues that the police outside London don't
7326,E,N,F,P,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, the past decade has perfectly demonstrated this"
7327,E,N,F,P,"Meal replacement powder, has a lot of fibre in compared to what most people eat :)"
7328,E,N,F,P,"Not payed by them or anything lol, but I've replaced my breakfast each day with huel and now nearly all of my poops are 10/10 poops"
7329,E,N,F,P,"Haha fair enough. I meant relative to making and eating food. I'm lactose intolerant so do understand how long it can take to poop, just obviously not as much as you lol"
7330,E,N,F,P,"Tax cuts are not going to give people enough extra money to buy houses. Only way young people will be able to afford houses is lowering house prices, either by building a hell of a lot more affordable housing or artificially reducing house prices"
7331,E,N,F,P,"Pooping is better than eating. Doesn't take long, is a nice break from work and you can go on your phone at the same time"
7332,E,N,F,P,No idea lol. Maybe try comparing the real life version of him to the version in your head if that makes sense?
7333,E,N,F,J,Not telling the others on voice chat who the imposter is is so much fun!  Last night I was on discord with two friends and I won as the imposter twice by having to manage how I acted in game AND on the phone.  It stretches the game’s demands as long as you don’t ruin it for others by ratting someone out.
7334,E,N,F,J,Bruh
7335,E,N,F,J,"I don’t like being photographed at work without my consent, thanks"
7336,E,N,F,J,If you ever need mom advice message me.  I’d be happy to help.
7337,E,N,F,J,Take it from an older woman.  Just get different friends that respect your value and don’t need fixing.
7338,E,N,F,J,"You are loved, valuable, and worth living.  Please don’t kill your self."
7339,E,N,F,J,MY RUSSIAN TEACHER HEART IS SINGING
7340,E,N,F,J,Happy birthday mom!
7341,E,N,F,J,I want to be her wow
7342,E,N,F,J,I’m a cool teacher! I did it
7343,E,N,F,J,I was a panther in high school!  Different school
7344,E,N,F,J,Me dragging my nine friends on adventures
7345,E,N,F,J,I’m doing my part!
7346,E,N,F,J,My parents are ENFP and INFJ and I can see my mom writing this about my dad. Precious
7347,E,N,F,J,Just reported while covering the phone with my hand to not see
7348,E,N,F,J,I have one one I got in Moscow!
7349,E,N,F,J,The uploading 97% is too real
7350,E,N,F,J,Where is Olaf? (Not a criticism I love what you did!)
7351,E,N,F,J,"Good luck, have fun!"
7352,E,N,F,J,You literally have sus in your username.  I’m voting for you
7353,E,N,F,J,"I’m a 7 sx/so.  I don’t always look like a typical seven stereotype because I am always looking for deep experiences and relationships with people, which may be going very deep into a video game, new job field, or new intellectual pursuit.  I’m also super in tune with my five line."
7354,E,N,F,J,Why must you hurt me in this way
7355,E,N,F,J,ENFJ seven.  Yesss
7356,E,N,F,J,I use the upside down smile
7357,E,N,F,J,"You are right that she should be stepping up, but every life is valuable."
7358,E,N,F,J,Why did it hit harder in spanish
7359,E,N,F,J,"I love this so much

Edited because I was dumb and couldn’t type"
7360,E,N,F,J,"No problem!  I also was introduced to the enneagram at church and let me tell you, it’s a great tool for your walk with Christ.  Enjoy!"
7361,E,N,F,J,I would say to look into the fears and motivations for each type.  Really analyze whether you make your decisions out of a feeling you are not whole/complete or out of a fear of not being safe or secure.  Best of luck!
7362,E,N,F,J,Wow accurate
7363,E,N,F,J,Hey!  It me!  Best example I have is that I love traveling but have some of the worst travel anxiety you’ve ever seen.  It’s wanting to do everything but also being afraid to
7364,E,N,F,J,I’m both
7365,E,N,F,J,Thanks man.
7366,E,N,F,J,"Yo, you’re at the Great Patriotic War Museum in Moscow!"
7367,E,N,F,J,"Dude, as a seven I don’t have a favorite anything.  Or more accurately, I have a new favorite everything weekly."
7368,E,N,F,J,"False, I never get to play imposter"
7369,E,N,F,J,Dude I saw you vent
7370,E,N,F,J,This enfj is in love with your poetry
7371,E,N,F,J,Nope Memphis
7372,E,N,F,J,"Congrats, my dude!"

7374,E,N,F,J,"It’s green, they convinced us to kick out yellow"
7375,E,N,F,J,"Wow, I’m having an off day and needed to hear that that’s ok.  Thanks"
7376,E,N,F,J,So sweet.  This is the best feeling in the world!
7377,E,N,F,J,Congrats!
7378,E,N,F,J,It’s true.
7379,E,N,F,J,Confirmed.  I need Jesus
7380,E,N,F,J,draw shostakovich!!
7381,E,N,F,J,"Hello, it’s me"
7382,E,N,F,J,"Oof, right in the six wing"
7383,E,N,T,P,That's some god level artwork here
7384,E,N,T,P,"Cant speak for ENTJ's, but im an ESTJ and i wear suits daily."
7385,E,N,T,P,/s
7386,E,N,T,P,"He's an ISFP, but it isn't obvious at first"
7387,E,N,T,P,"The INTJ guy lacks confidence, but he really is arrogant, the INTP on the other hand is very confident and extremely arrogant. I think my best friend INTJ has 50/50 chance of really having narcissistic personality disorder, but the second one, i am 90% sure he is a narcissist."
7388,E,N,T,P,"In my experience more thinkers are narcissists, from what i saw most of them were NT types (INTX mostly) My best friend INTJ is narcissistic, but in a slight way. My INTP friend is severely narcissistic, he is far more feeling than my INTJ friend, but his narcissism is sometimes unbearable, he has to always be the greatest, even if everyone tells him what he should change in himself in order for us to like him, he doesn't accept our criticism and he belittles us. It's been worsening with age."
7389,E,N,T,P,"I like to mix things up, obviously no person listens to only one genre, but i dont really care what the genre is if i like the songs. I listen to Jazz the most, i like Bebop Jazz because it always changes (ive heard that Jazz is the theme of ENTP's, i don't have ENTP friends so i cant really confirm). Besides jazz, i like some hard and deep music. From the top of my head, i cant tell i most often listen to Gorillaz, $uicideboys, Chet Baker and Yoko Kanno. Lofi, of course there are many lofi artists that i listen to often, but there are so many i cant name them all, like saib., Potsu and Nujabes."
7390,E,N,T,P,Amazing! This will make a great wallpaper
7391,E,N,T,P,Why would an NT want an NF? This is a serious question
7392,E,N,T,P,"It do be like that doe





I be white"
7393,E,N,T,P,"Of course, no sensors XDD

Whoever made that image, i think it exactly explains the good and the bad in the types, i learned a lot about my friends through this.
Waiting for the sensor version though."
7394,E,N,T,P,"I don't like how sensors are often thrown in the trash section, im a sensor, and most of my friends that are into MBTI, as soon as they learned im an ESTP, they started poking fun at me and saying stuff like ""You're a sensor, your shallow, you don't know anything, you don't understand philosophy etc."" It pisses me off that a letter in an online test can change your friends bias towards you."
7395,E,N,T,P,"Male ESTP, i dye my hair every few months"

7400,E,N,T,P,Bee movie
7401,E,N,T,P,So the ESTP is at the gym and couldn't get there
7402,E,N,T,P,"Taking the test in English seems to give me more accurate results than taking it in my native language, happened to my friends too. Seems like the questions are constructed better in English"
7403,E,N,T,P,"Black veil brides

saib."
7404,E,N,T,P,"What's this meme format name, i love it and saw many of those but i dont know how to search for them"
7405,E,N,T,P,"I am unable not to fidget during anything, coincidentally i just took a ADHD test and the results weren't clear, but from my experience and observation of my ESTP friends, i would say its normal for us to be restless and move all the time, heck i cant sit in a bus because i prefer to stand up because its more ""productive"". Never have i ever met a ESTP that sat still and was calm."
7406,E,N,T,P,"It made me start my calisthenics journey once again after i lost the motivation, now since i have some free time I'm training hard. Not only that, i am into boxing now too, so i gained one new ""hobby"" and got myself to resume my training."
7407,E,N,T,P,"I didn't train my abs for half a year, and then decided to get to 10% body fat via recomp. Not only did i became underweight, my abs are barely visible, decided it wasn't really worth it and i should focus on directly training the muscle more, you can have visible abs at 15% body fat and it looks great, but to get to that point you need to really train them hard."
7408,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, same. Ive been mistyped as an ENTJ for over half a year, the functions never really resonated with me and i always saw myself as more of a Se user than a Te user.  
ESTP 8w7"
7409,E,N,T,P,INTP i guess?
7410,E,N,T,P,Looks very INFP
7411,E,N,T,P,My first thought was INTP
7412,E,N,T,P,I would say ISFJ
7413,E,N,T,P,"My first thought was ISFP, could be ISTP though"
7414,E,N,T,P,That's what we thought
7415,E,N,T,P,Dio (JoJo)
7416,E,N,T,P,"Did the test myself and got completely different results

Yours look like an INFP to me
Could be ENFP"
7417,E,N,T,P,Either INTP or ENTP
7418,E,N,T,P,"ENTJ-Maple, kinda surprising"
7419,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, ive been researching mbti for over a year now and the tests are really predictable.  Thanks a lot!"
7420,I,N,T,P,"DK vs Steve is doable, but it's very dependent on the DK staying in the right distance to punish Steve for camping, in which case Steve can't do much."

7422,I,N,T,P,"Realistic human characters are boooerriinnngggg, lol"
7423,I,N,T,P,"Perfectly describes high school me. Cut to ten years, a few acid trips and countless tokes of weed later, my weirdness is significantly more under control, at least as much as I'm willing to control it ;)"
7424,I,N,T,P,"He's the first fighter introduced that originated from a PC game, that used to seem like one of those soft rules nintendo had. Like, at first it was just Nintendo brand, then they started crossing over to other consoles and developers. I only ever saw comments asking for Steve alongside ones asking for Goku and Shrek. Steve is FINE, but i think subconsciously i've been worrying about what comes next."
7425,I,N,T,P,"I love both games, but the cross over still feels weird. It's like i'm eating lasagna with peanut butter. Seems like it would have been more appropriate as mii costumes or something"
7426,I,N,T,P,It's just weird that he's the first full character in the game that was originally from the PC. Doesn't feel right
7427,I,N,T,P,"Still holding out for Tails, Crash, Rayman or Geno. Steve was literally not even a possibility in my mind, now i wouldn't be surprised to see Master Chief, or Dante, or the dude from Uncharted next... Though we all know it's going to be another Fire Emblem character."
7428,I,N,T,P,"My man, Tails, though :'("
7429,I,N,T,P,"Right? Nintendo be pumping out some weird characters and I'm here like, yeah, that's cool, but smash was already the perfect game, so these unique mechanics are feeling a bit extra"
7430,I,N,T,P,"Kinda, that's why it's difficult to explain why I'm not a fan of this choice. I'm usually a very logical person, but in this instance it's more of just a feeling of unease. Like the flood gates are opening and soon we'll have Goku and Shrek. I'll just have to wait and see how it all turns out, maybe I become a Steve main. I'm sure he'll have that annoying campy playstyle I love xD"
7431,I,N,T,P,"Watching the trailer makes me worry he's going to be another complicated gimmicky character, which by itself isn't bad, but Nintendo sure seems to be on a ""every new character needs a brand new mechanic with unique controls"" streak."
7432,I,N,T,P,"It just feels weird, it's the first representative in smash to originate on PC. I understand Minecraft is on pretty much anything with a screen now, but... Idk, it just feels unnatural. I'm not hating on the people that wanted this, but it's impossible I'm on my own in thinking this is just a strange crossover 🤷"
7433,I,N,T,P,"I like Minecraft, I grew up with it, I still feel like it's an awkward match and there's lots of other characters way more deserving of a spot in smash. I'm not like, upset, more like - unimpressed"
7434,I,N,T,P,"Not trying to hate, but I am terriblly underwhelmed by the whole situation. I like Minecraft, but it just doesn't feel right..."
7435,I,N,T,P,not an ENTP but... ROMANCE SEQUENCE INITIATED. GREETINGS POTENTIAL FEMALE MATE. MY SENSORS INDICATE YOU ARE HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE. PLEASE PROCEED TO MY BASEMENT FOR SUBSCRIPTION TELEVISION AND RELAXATION. AFFIRMATIVE! AFFIRMATIVE!
7436,I,N,T,P,"I kind of blend the two, but weed and psychedelics have been a pretty big influence in that"
7437,I,N,T,P,"I mean, niceness is a factor, usually I don't develop feelings until i determine whether or not I like their personality and it is compatible with mine"
7438,I,N,T,P,That's a lot funnier when you don't live in America and see the possibility... Luckily climate change will kill us all first thanks to this orange idiot that publicly denies it's existence......... Yaaaaayyy......
7439,I,N,T,P,"I can't blame Canada, our president is a fucking selfish man child who understands nothing past the thickness of his wallet"
7440,I,N,T,P,Up vote for spending one out of ten nails on a Pikmin. Much class
7441,I,N,T,P,I wonder how many intuitives calling sensors dumb are actually just sensors in denial
7442,I,N,T,P,Nothing on this subreddit has made me feel more INTP xD
7443,I,N,T,P,"Nice edit, painfully accurate"
7444,I,N,T,P,"I wish this ISTP girl I knew would ""beat me up"""
7445,I,N,T,P,"Idk, that would require actual educational funding, and it seems like our current government would prefer to go out of it's way too make their citizens dumber and less informed, I wonder why? 🤔🤔"
7446,I,N,T,P,Once I thought I came blood and realized that I just broke the skin mastrabaiting too hard. Good Lord was I trying to distract myself from that hangover
7447,I,N,T,P,It's time for flex healers to shine :) it looks like utility is more valuable than healing right now
7448,I,N,T,P,"Cool, just what we needed 40 years ago!"
7449,I,N,T,P,"Most of the time most of the community doesn't have much of a problem with the patches. It's generally like 5-10% of the community that complain incessantly and make the community appear unhappy from an observer's point of view. Blizzard has said something like that before, and went on to say it's not their aim to please everyone because that's just straight up impossible. 

 The only patches I don't care for are the ones that made Mercy a must pick. As a flex player I often got left with the job 😥"
7450,I,N,T,P,"That implies we ever lived in the real world, which is just false"
7451,I,N,T,P,"You call them Reddit Lucios, I call them most Lucios"
7452,I,N,T,P,Data is sad 😢
7453,I,N,T,P,"I mean, yeah, the range was nerfed by almost 45%, but the speed was increased by 50%. Hard to tell what will become of that in the future, might even make halt MORE consistent at longer ranges. I'm more bummed about the armor nerf"
7454,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, I run out of letters with this process, but at least I complete the alphabet"
7455,I,N,T,P,"Well, defensive ultimates are falling out of favor. No small wonder when they take AGES to charge. It's nigh impossible to earm as many transcendences as a Genji earns dragon blades. It's a better environment for characters that can shut down ults with basic abilities. Brigette immediately comes to mind, but there's also Bap's immortality field and Ana's sleep dart and grenade."
7456,I,N,T,P,"Why would i want to save money on chicken nuggets? Nothing can fill the void in my cold, empty stomach. That's where my void is because i don't have a heart."
7457,I,N,T,P,i like how that right tower looks like it's still under construction
7458,I,N,T,P,"Naw dude, don't panic unless you develop an abnormal interest in heavy machinery, motorcycles and jumping in cold ass lakes."
7459,I,N,T,P,"Hmm... I used to hate being an INTP, but you don't want to be an ENTJ (they are just as broken). I would suggest finding someone who thinks your cool, quirky and mysterious. Then you fall in love with them because i'm so alone. Then scare them away with how weird and clingy i am. Then form a destructive drinking habit until I can't feel or remember anything. Also, learn guitar - it's bad ass."
7460,I,N,T,P,"Wow, and since INTPs are the best type i don't want to imagine what that means all the other types' letters must stand for"
7461,I,N,T,P,I play a fair amount of Wrecking Ball and whenever i notice this i just figure it's my fault for going in before my team was ready.
7462,I,N,T,P,Cognitive function were introduced specifically as a way to explain a person's preferences hard wired into their brain by their DNA. Experiences are what start filling in the gaps and adding color to the whole personality.
7463,I,N,T,P,"This may come as a shock, but from my experience - just go hang out with people. Get out of your comfort zone every now and then. Get to know people, learn their motivations and how they differ (or don't differ) from your own. Experiment, take mental notes (or real ones, i used to keep a journal pretty regularly when i was going through some shit) and actively try to learn how your actions are liable to make people react. It doesn't happen overnight, but just be patient and keep at it."
7464,I,N,T,P,I could never go to sleep at night because i felt guilty for all the crap i could have done. Now i'm at peace with the meaninglessness of the universe and am secure in the knowledge i don't owe anything to anyone \^\_\^
7465,I,N,T,P,"Heh, nice, my ISTP friend will get a kick out of this xD"
7466,I,N,T,P,Like I needed a graph to tell me INTP is the coolest type 😎😎
7467,I,N,T,P,"Positioning is always situational, but for Brig a general rule of thumb is to stay near allies with similar range and/or mobility as you. Just pay attention to if you're back line is being dove, Brigitte has more value as a peeler than as a pusher or initiator. Most importantly, position yourself to avoid damage until a fight breaks out. You are pretty much a sitting duck and a burden to your team until the enemy are in your range."
7468,I,N,T,P,It's scary that he sincerely doesn't believe he's responsible for his own poor approval ratings.
7469,I,N,T,P,"Yeah yeah, and Einstein married his cousin. We are all weird :)"
7470,I,N,T,P,"Agree. I saw for the first time a girl that was going to be my roommate. I didn't know she was gonna be my roommate but when I saw her, I instantly didn't like her. She had a bad bitch face. Guess what, we shared room and she did some shitty things to me after all... 
After some time I realized that probably I can read people better than I think and before I was thinking, you can't judge people by their appearance. But now, I think I can read people, I usually know what people I'm gonna get along with, and I follow my intuition better now."
7471,I,N,T,P,I think a realistic INTP would never achieve to be a scientist because it's too much work and effort. Maybe INTP-A. But definitely not an INTP-T. I'm an INTP-T. I've been good at science and I loved technology. I don't know why I ended up doing communications degree and my brain is too logical to do that. And now I'm fucked up. So I'm lost in life lol
7472,I,N,T,P,"I think it doesn't work like that. In Europe housing is really expensive. It doesn't matter if it's a shitty city, the house prices are really expensive... You can't save money because you spend every penny on expenses, taxes, food, transportation (which can be really expensive too)... So basically you can't safe money but you still live in a shitty city."
7473,I,N,T,P,"I don't know. Usually the people that most get me and understand me are Scorpios, maybe because of my 3rd house in Scorpio and stellium in 8th house... 
I feel like they understand my depth and I understand their depth. It depends on the Scorpio but If they're advanced and not toxic, they're amazing. I also drawn in my emotions... I feel like they invade me and I need time to rest to deal with my emotions. I also need alone time and even feel like I'm hiding somewhere so that I feel safe... 
I've met many fire signs and they're usually pretty much positive... Like, when I get sad I literally fall from where I am and I become depressed and I enter into the darkness, into hell... Then I need some time to come out lol. But I feel like fire and air signs don't have this. They recover easily and they feel less pain because they're not sensitive. For example, I feel like aquarius or Leos or sags are not sensitive at all... I'm hypersensitive... a sensitive person can't be rough with their words or can't get along with everyone... And Leos and air signs or sags usually get along with everyone."
7474,I,N,T,P,"I feel like people complain so much about shit I don't find that sad. I went through a lot of shit and I only empathize with things I went through... I can't empathize with you complaining about your boyfriend, or about romantic stuff. I freaking hate it. They're lucky to even have a romantic partner so I can't empathize with them lol... There are many energetical vampires. So I don't let people complain with me nor tell me their problems. I'm too good for them, I don't fake my emotions, but they do. They can talk for 4 hours and complain and cry and shit and you give them all your energy and then they feel great and you feel tired and empty. I don't give my shoulder easily like that. I'm not no one's therapist. If people have problems I always advise them to go to a therapist. I don't want to be their shoulder to cry on..."
7475,I,N,T,P,"I don't know if you know MBTI but I'm an INTP, Aries sun Virgo rising Libra moon, aries mercury. I'm intuitive. But I'm not a feeler. I don't like dealing with people's emotions, though I'm really empathetic so I don't know how to explain that. I just don't empathize with some people because I find them fake. But I'm much more deeper than other fire or air signs I know. Maybe it's because I have stellium in 8th house. I don't get along with superficial people like some Leos, sags, libras, etc."
7476,I,N,T,P,I'm a really sensitive aries. I have Libra moon and virgo Rising. But I'm quite sensitive myself. I hate it when some Aries are just really selfish and childish and don't give a shit about people's feelings but then you say something to them and they get offended. Don't say shit if you're not gonna be able to take the response... Also they're too stubborn and egocentric. Mostly Aries men. They're just DUMB sometimes hahaha... I guess my Virgo rising and my Libra moon kind of hate aries traits lol
7477,I,N,T,P,They can't control their monkey instincts...
7478,I,N,T,P,The key is to be maskless while you're still wearing a mask lmao
7479,I,N,T,P,"Yeah it's true. The boys I like usually date girls that are quite submissive and really cute, submissive way cute. Like, a lot of them couldn't live without a man. And then I think, Should I be a submissive bitch so guys will date me?? And I don't want to be a woman like that. There are many women out there that have suffered a lot because of their submissive attitude and I don't want to be like that."
7480,I,N,T,P,Yeah wtf. Why would anyone be intimidated??
7481,I,N,T,P,"Lol but he can't win an Emmy because he didn't play anything amazing or weird, he doesn't have incredible acting skills, and also he's just playing a normal character. It's not like a series about killers or The Big Bang theory where they do more acting or something... Ted's character is really basic... The end ruined everything. They didn't need a happy ending but definetly the show was a comedy show and they can't turn in into a tragedy in 40 minutes of the last episode."
7482,I,N,T,P,"Well you know the camera is not really about megapixels but colors, lense distortion... Etc. Chinese phones usually suck at cameras and mostly at selfie cameras... Samsung even though not being Chinese I think it takes shitty pics to people. I think Oppo is probably the best one in those prices."
7483,I,N,T,P,It looks like the 4a. It doesn't look premium at all. I'd buy the 4a before the 5.
7484,I,N,T,P,You're so RIGHT!! this is what I needed. Thank you.
7485,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. 

-Fellow INTP haha"
7486,I,N,T,P,"I feel identified with this. As an INTP, what if the mother is an abuser, a narcissist, a terrible mother, she treats her children like shit? We only see one part and it's the agression of the child. But what is the reason? Why would a child be agressive to their parents without a reason??? 
I would not act. And If I acted I would call child services actually."
7487,I,N,T,P,Hahaha as a Boss I would fire him. We don't talk about family at work. Hahaha
7488,I,N,T,P,"Yep. THEY CHOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN. But when you're poor and childfree, you're not choosing that..."
7489,I,N,T,P,"Yeah... When they say thrift shopping is cheaper and you buy real brands... I mean, the prices are the same or even higher to new clothes now. I don't live in the US but elsewhere anywhere it's like that. I don't see buying used clothes if they're gonna be as expensive as new ones."
7490,I,N,T,P,"I think for example Robin in How I met your mother had a great ending. She stayed loyal to her character. I mean, she couldn't have children though and SPOILER:
I hated the end of How I met your mother because Ted gets married and achieves his objective: Getting married and having children. 
SPOILER ALERT: 
The mom dies, and after maybe 40 years??? HE GOES BACK TO ROBIN AGAIN. I find it INCREDIBLY SELFISH from Ted. He just was in love with Robin ALL THE TIME. Even married. And as she couldn't have children, he thought she wasn't the one. But after his wife dying... He gets back to her. THAT'S THE WORST BETRAYAL IN THE WORLD..."
7491,I,N,T,P,"Yep. They never give interesting characters to women. I liked the character of Jodie Foster in the silence of the lambs... She's strong and powerful and a great female character. In the second movie though, Jodie didn't want to play because she falls in love with Hannibal, he escapes or something and they fall for each other. Jodie thought that the character would never do that. See?? It's the same shit always with female characters. They always fuck it up because they romanticize or make women clingy and stupid."
7492,I,N,T,P,"But she ended up doing exactly that, but with the difference that he was a vampire and he had sexual needs towards her blood Lmao it's such a stupid movie hahaha"
7493,I,N,T,P,Well the whole movie was too clingy. And then when the wolf guy did an IMPRENTATION or some shit in the little girl... PEDOPHILIA???? LOL
7494,I,N,T,P,Oh no. I don't want to achieve my 30s. Ever. I'm afraid of this. I'm usually not very social anyways but honestly I don't want to just suddenly meet new people and have to talk to them about children. It's like a nightmare. I guess we need to make groups for child free friendships...
7495,I,N,T,P,"Yes. Now they are advertising the iPhone 12 like the ONLY PHONE THAT HAS 5G. It's annoying. It's almost FRAUD or false advertising. If you listen carefully they have an advertising like: WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS. And it's straight up a lie. They're never the ones that do something first, maybe sometimes, but not always. Only phone with 5g?? What about the only phone that doesn't have a faster screen for nowadays technology while the price is 50% higher? 
Oh and also it's so funny in their ads they say: CALLING, MESSAGING, DOING THIS OR THAT, CLOUD... 
Apple, ANY PHONE CAN DO THOSE THINGS. Only the people that don't know about technology think Apple is a genius inventor."
7496,I,N,T,P,"In Europe is more of the same. Minimum wage 900-1000 Euros. One room in a shared appartement in a city: 600 Euros. So basically you just have 300 Euros for transport, food, expenses... 
Unless you live incredibly far away or in a city that no one wants to live in..."
7497,I,N,T,P,"Uhmn thanks. Yes, I actually MAY have depression. But I know I won't be able to solve my depression because it comes from a problem. As I can't solve that problem because it's physical, I guess I get bitter because I see everything with a negative view... 
I don't think anyone cares about me and I don't think I have to care about anyone either because it only brings pain."
7498,I,N,T,P,"No, I didn't say that. I said that to me, everyone is the same. Every human being is the same and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter the culture because human beings think the same way and act the same way even though being in different countries."
7499,I,N,T,P,I don't think this is unpopular. Just go and look at Instagram. All those fitness girls are hot. They have millions of followers. They have the same opinion as you
7500,I,N,T,P,"I agree. But at the same time, you stay with a bittersweet sensation after watching the movie. I think that sometimes we need that Happy ending. Even though we know in real life it's not like that, that's why it's a movie. It's not real.  I love tragedy ending movies though. Yeah it would be great if just they all ended miserably. Lmao imagine Friends ending like shit. 
I remember I hated the ending of How I met your mother because it was too bittersweet..."
7501,I,N,T,P,My father is a cancer. I don't understand him. I'm an aries. We're completely different. He's negative and really passive. Also he's so weird. I don't know. He's a mysterious man. I'll never understand him.
7502,I,N,T,P,"I'm an aries and I always get along with scorps I don't know how, my friends were always Scorpios. They understand me the best. And they get me the most. Maybe it's because I have my 3rd house in Scorpio and an aries stellium un 8th house."
7503,I,N,T,P,Yep your Scorpio needs some PASSION
7504,I,N,T,P,"God I KNEW YOU WERE A VIRGO FROM YOUR COMMENT OF: I don't smoke, I don't put shit in my body :)


lmao"
7505,I,N,T,P,"Aries moon makes people explosive and incredibly impulsive. They're like children, really annoying. Aries sun are better and more mature than Aries moon."
7506,I,N,T,P,I have Gemini Venus and I'm not slutty at all. I don't know why. Maybe it's my 7th house Saturn in pisces... And 5th house Jupiter in capricorn... I don't like anyone. I always like caps and they run away from me cause I'm an aries
7507,I,N,T,P,"Yep I never say anything personal to a gemini. But of course, they even tell basic information about you to everyone. Lol."
7508,I,N,T,P,I'm skinny but I don't have a tiny waist. Skinny women usually are supposed to have more of a rectangular shape. You will never achieve a hourglass figure. Really few women are born with that figure. And if you're tall it's almost impossible you'll have that figure. But whatever. They work out a lot to get those waists I guess.
7509,I,N,T,P,"Obviously insecure women are the ones that most buy shit to look better. Look at how much we waste for beauty: skin care routine, makeup, clothes, hairstyler, hair products, gym, healthy food, supplements... Etc. Everything to look  beautiful. And also women compete between each other all the time. They're jealous and envious of each other a lot of times... That competition makes us want to achieve perfectionism..."
7510,I,N,T,P,They're the responsible of that. No one forces them to edit their pics. They're obsessed with competition and competing between each other. Instagram is like a magazine of girls that promote themselves...
7511,I,N,T,P,A naturally skinny woman doesn't have much curves. Now it looks like girls are skinny and also have slim waists like a needle. It's not usual. But it looks like it's so common because of Instagram
7512,I,N,T,P,What does gen Ed mean?
7513,I,N,T,P,"I agree. Most people I know that study science, they just repeat everything they've studied but can't think of themselves nor have their own opinion. That's exactly the opposite of scientific brain..."
7514,I,N,T,P,Too much talking but no doing.
7515,I,N,T,P,What is real?
7516,I,N,T,P,Lol science and philosophy go by hand... Those questions asked by philosophy are exactly the ones science tries to answer...
7517,I,N,T,P,I think it's not a huge difference but still. I think 99% of the girls on Instagram just fake their bodies. I'm actually sure. I don't believe in anything I see on Instagram.
7518,I,N,T,P,"Hahaha what about Elon Musk children?

Xi-Ai-344o9
R2D788-998 

LMAO It's almost like this. They're fucking crazy."
7519,I,N,T,P,No. And I have a libra moon. I feel like shit. ALWAYS. It doesn't matter what season we are lmao

7535,I,N,T,J,"Thanks, everyone!! Arnold is truly MAGIC. He’s super chill and friendly to all living things (including his 3 adoptive sisters)... Just a love meowster. Here are some fun facts for your enjoyment:
- Every night he insists falling asleep between his mama and papa (human parents);
- He has big paws for his size (10lb) because of his suspected Maine Coon lineage;
- He’s named after Arnold Schwarzenegger because his papa loves his movies; so he’s also known as Arnold the Fluffnator."

7546,I,N,T,J,"I was brought up in a heavily Christian family and community most of my childhood until I became primarily agnostic mid-20s (I'm in my 30s now). I've heard this verse many, many times in my life before but never truly resonated with it until I came across your post and simultaneously reflected on the love I share with my partner now long after I left my Christian faith. It was a strange but profound moment for me to finally understand what the Bible said about love only after I ventured out to the world outside church. Thank you for taking up the courage to post it. It really touched me."

7553,I,N,T,J,She looks like the barkeep she-man from Shrek
7554,I,N,T,J,This INFJ concurs
7555,I,N,T,J,I can definitely relate! It's sort of oxymoronic that people like us (I imagine a lot of INFJ's) feel like they are being a burden on others or asking for too much while they tend to  give and care for their loved ones unconditionally. Personally I've been practicing to consistently remind myself that I am enough and that it's more about graciously/gratefully accepting the love and kindness towards me than questioning myself relentlessly whether I deserve it fairly.

My parents had me on purpose in order to force my grandparents to allow them to get married before his oldest son could marry first (tradition). Then they immigrated me and my brother primarily to give my brother  a better learning environment that is kinder to kids on spectrum (turns out he wasn't on the spectrum; just really timid). I wasn't allowed to work during high school, but the moment I graduated, I started working two jobs to put myself through college, I've left home and worked ever since. Over the years, I've given my mom money almost every month throughout my employment in the work force and never asked her for money even though they gave my car that I paid for to my brother while I went away to school. I even paused a year to come home to help run a business venture my mom and her sister wanted to do despite my strong disagreement, which eventually fell through and they came out of it penniless. I just quit my job last year for health reasons and am going back to educational program to finally pursue my dream. I've been living off of my savings purely in another city. But I found out through my cousin that my mom, aunt and adult brother, who has never left home and worked at a company for less than a year before going to grad school that my parents are paying for, have talked shit about me amongst themselves because I didnt give them enough money despite making ""lots"" from previous companies. Turns out they didn't take into account of the 33% income tax and my living expense in one of the most expensive  cities in the country. I ate all my meals at work to save money so I could live while sharing with them what I thought was a token of thanks for raising me and for the sacrifice they made as an immigrant family.

Just like you said, OP, the world may view them deserving of respect for their selflessness and sacrifice, but know that it was their duty to raise you as parents while it is not your duty to be responsible for them as their children because they are adults. It is a beautiful thing if the children take care of their elderly out of goodness of their heart, but it must not be forced, assumed or belittled in my case..."
7559,I,N,T,J,"If you want him again on your island without your husband losing, you can use an amiibo coin (way more affordable and safer than the cards that are currently transitioned off Amazon) to summon him! I don't want to mistakenly come off promoting particular Etsy shops I bought from, so DM me if you're interested!"
7560,I,N,T,J,I wish I found this before I created a blueprint to redesign the entire island in respect to the RS being on level 3.. Better late than never! Thank you!
7561,I,N,T,J,Worked in Los Angeles (5/21)
7562,I,N,T,J,"Hah! Thanks for the laugh, dude"
7563,I,N,T,J,You are awesome! Thank you so much for the tip!
7564,I,N,T,J,You could remove them by hitting them with a net 2-3 times repeatedly then chat with them for anything BUT apologize. Eventually they’d say they’re leaving to explore elsewhere lol
7565,I,N,T,J,"After feeling unsure about the show watching its first episode, I learned that this was based on an original comic book series that had amazing reception. I decided to drop the show and switched onto the comics, and boy am I glad I did!! The original comic books are wayyyy more interesting, intense, gory, smart, and just pure fun. The pace is faster yet you're not rushed; you just get more exposed to its beautifully twisted universe and secrets. I highly recommend checking out the comics and drop he goddamn show so they don't renew it and freakin ruin the og books.."
7566,I,N,T,J,SAME HERE!
7567,I,N,T,J,This is why I sub here
7568,I,N,T,J,"With your sales background and interest in tech, I highly recommend being a tech recruiter. Being am in-house recruiter for a company is most stable, but the best way to get your foot in the door is to join a recruiting agency where you can make a lot more money from commission for making placements (this would be at a continent agency not retained). I left a tech recruiter job at an entertainment company as mid level to pursue a personal passion not in recruiting, but until then I made 5k per month after taxes. Starting with IT needs is the easiest but if you wanna go far and make yourself competitive, make sure you understand software engineering and its subfield s"
7569,I,N,T,J,Pinging the true OP /u/jay_no_pho
7570,I,N,F,P,Same
7571,I,N,F,P,THANK YOU
7572,I,N,F,P,"You’re welcome, keep it up :’)"
7573,I,N,F,P,Lmfao
7574,I,N,F,P,"This is gonna be weird af but can I be a part of your family, you all sound hella dope"
7575,I,N,F,P,Then trump personally called Karen to crown her “parent of the year”
7576,I,N,F,P,">kuk Kek?

UNGA BUDAHGA KAHN"
7577,I,N,F,P,No that actually makes sense haha. I end up basically doing that unintentionally but I guess the difference is whether I’m hard on myself about it or not. I’m sure I could benefit from changing my mindset in that way
7578,I,N,F,P,"Thanks for the advice! I always found note taking while reading to be a pain in the ass cause I struggle with summarization and I feel like it takes 3x as long but I’m willing to try it again if it helps with retention :) also I have done the second one before and it definitely helps IIRC, I guess now I just gotta remember to do it!! Haha"
7579,I,N,F,P,This is me 100% and it sucks so I feel you
7580,I,N,F,P,"Thank you so much, I appreciate it :’)

Sadly I find that I don’t retain much more from thoroughly reading material vs skimming. I got through it with very little comprehension this time but next time I’ll try that out for sure!"
7581,I,N,F,P,I suppose that makes sense. Maybe my reply of genuine confusion came off as fake? He just seemed incredibly suspicious of me with every question. And mind you this was the doctor giving me a checkup before he sent me in to see the actual psychologist :\
7582,I,N,F,P,He’ll get what’s coming to him. He’s bound to if he keeps on with this bullshit
7583,I,N,F,P,"I actually haven't but no worries, I'm still searching for a proper diagnosis because as of late ADHD seems to put all the pieces together. I know it's a tedious process but I'll get there eventually :)"
7584,I,N,F,P,For the love of god I hope so cause that happens to me a lot. I’ll be back to square one if I don’t get a diagnosis :\
7585,I,N,F,P,That is absolutely ridiculous :\ I definitely got bipolar pinned on me at first as well. I think with how fidgety and scatterbrained I am they must assume I’m in a manic phase or something when I come in looking for treatment
7586,I,N,F,P,"I felt absolutely nothing all the way up to 80mg. Everyone’s different though, of course my psych told me her other patients had good results with it :\"
7587,I,N,F,P,"Too much emphasis on depression because of an “unstable childhood” because I so happened to move around a lot, where my bigger problems were anxiety and overwhelm. He sent me down a never ending path of antidepressants, unsuccessful treatment which only caused more anxiety and overwhelm. There’s a lot more going on but too much to delve into"
7588,I,N,F,P,Hell yes 😖
7589,I,N,F,P,My body becomes physically uncomfortable when I have to sit down and sustain mental focus on something
7590,I,N,F,P,"I feel your discontent, friend.."
7591,I,N,F,P,"I suspected something was wrong with me since middle school (there IS, a LOT) and finally came across ADHD in my search for a psych. I had no idea what it was or how it was treated but immediately upon seeing a doctor for an evaluation he asked me if I’d “tried any of my friends meds” bc I’m a college student. Now I’ve been cycling antidepressants for about 2 years now because I’m ALSO a girl and people refuse to believe girls can have ADHD even if all the signs point to yes. 

These biases need to be grilled tf out of medical professionals"
7592,I,N,F,P,Both of our first psychs: 🤡 🤡 🤡
7593,I,N,F,P,"It still would be nice if controlled substances weren’t restricted for shipping, like the pharmacist and psych both know my address so it’s obviously not going to anyone else 🙄"
7594,I,N,F,P,Wish I could give you an award
7595,I,N,F,P,Bro let’s play some fucking Minecraft
7596,I,N,F,P,"That’s a pretty solid theory. I know there’s evidence to support willful miscommunication, for example say someone speaks standard American English and calls an outsourced customer service rep who has an Indian accent. Apparently, due to engrained biases and unfamiliarity he may convince himself that he can’t understand the rep’s variation even if they’re clearly speaking the same language"
7597,I,N,F,P,A-fucking-men
7598,I,N,F,P,"Ayyyyyy I’ll drink to that, fella"
7599,I,N,F,P,❤️❤️❤️
7600,I,N,F,P,Thanks :)
7601,I,N,F,P,I ended up taking more lol
7602,I,N,F,P,Why is that so true
7603,I,N,F,P,You look quite warm toned like me
7604,I,N,F,P,I see this as an absolute win!
7605,I,N,F,P,I’m still fucking perplexed at her ability to fit through the goddamn door ffs
7606,I,N,F,P,"I know this is old but I just had to say, I am in almost the exact same situation as you. I just learned of my b thalassemia trait via my 23andme report which would explain my physical exhaustion that no one else, even with similar mental health issues, can seem to relate to. I’m only 21 but I’ve already gone through the gradual decline in energy since childhood and through my psychiatric journey (the issues were present since my teen years as well) I’ve been trying to find a solution to what seems like chronic fatigue and overwhelm. I’m so glad to know that some others CAN relate and I have at least once reason to believe I’m not just a lazy piece of shit."
7607,I,N,F,P,Yeah this whole post is really confusing in the context of reality
7608,I,N,F,P,Oh yes.... I can relate 100%
7609,I,N,F,P,"Omg me too please, you look amazing 😳😰"
7610,I,N,F,P,"I live about 45 minutes away and it’s 2:30 am. I still hear it. 

*pounds ceiling with broom handle* Quiet down that racket, y’all hear?"
7611,I,N,F,P,"I agree that sounds 100% like social anxiety — I have it. It’s a lot more complex and real than you would think, and pretty hard to explain when it’s happening. For me, personally... you know that feeling you get when you’re leaning back in a chair and you almost lose your balance — that whole heart stopping fight or flight type feeling? Imagine that every second of every minute that you have to be around individuals you are not intimately close with. It feels like there is danger in every social interaction and everyone is watching my every move, even and sometimes especially during phone calls/video chat. It can be tough deciding to even leave the house when I’m not obligated to, and slight embarrassments for you will be mortifying for me. I definitely have improved since being in college (senior now) but significant improvement take a lot of consistent exposure and it’s not easy at all — being confined during quarantine definitely does not help for me haha"
7612,I,N,F,P,HORNY🐶👆
7613,I,N,F,P,Yeah I feel bad for the guy and hope he gets out but picturing this is highkey funny
7614,I,N,F,P,"To these douchebags, yes. Sadly, they can’t imagine being nice to a girl without expecting her to “return the favor”"
7615,I,N,F,P,Idk why comments like yours are getting downvoted. Beauty is highly subjective and wholly cultural. There’s no certain appearance that everyone will consider attractive and that’s just fact
7616,I,N,F,P,Show me the way
7617,I,N,F,P,Thanks for the thorough reply! I’m glad things turned out well for you :) more than anything I’m unsure about the legitimacy of the test and worried about how expensive it is but I suppose if it can be a step toward finding the right treatment I could bite the bullet. I also did end up taking the Zoloft anyway so we’ll see how that goes as well
7618,I,N,F,P,Aww thank you!
7619,I,N,F,P,Thanks 🥰
7620,E,S,T,P,Is hiding your face an estp thing?? I totally do this too!!
7621,E,S,T,P,"I know if I lost my immediate family I’d be pretty broken after that. But a continuous fear I face often is not being enough. But only to the people that mean a lot to me or in a work situation. I really try to take pride in giving it my best in almost everything I do so when I fall short, I get pretty mad at myself"
7622,E,S,T,P,... 😶
7623,E,S,T,P,"Just butting in here.. but I think it’s important to be aware of the fact that maybe you’re training someone to take advantage of you. I’m only saying this because I have an INFJ roommate that does a lot for a 17 year old who lives with us now. She literally cooks for her everyday, wakes her up for school and caters to her childish behaviour. This 17 year old background is sad because her own parents disowned her and her upbringing was pretty abusive. So I understand filling in a void her parents failed to fill. But the results of catering to her is that this girl sleeps in a slips school, doesn’t help clean the house or cook dinner like she use to and constantly criticises my roommates meals now. While I have brought it up to my roommate of what I’ve observed, she has this thing inside her that compels her to care for others even when she’s sick. If I wasn’t around I don’t know who’d know to care for her"
7624,E,S,T,P,"I don’t even wanna know what I spent last years money on.... 




I’ll be right back."
7625,E,S,T,P,Shyeah!!
7626,E,S,T,P,Yeah I guess you’d have to write a lot of context before leading up to a scene to then leave a blank space for anonymous replies... I didn’t think that one through.
7627,E,S,T,P,Why don’t you create a scenario and leave a blank space for how we’d react or for what we’d maybe say and from the comments maybe you’ll like it for your story??
7628,E,S,T,P,Did you end up getting her food?
7629,E,S,T,P,"Yo! Im actually the same way! With me, deaths, hard times come my way and my emotional side feels nothing. Then one day it all hits me out of nowhere! So weird"
7630,E,S,T,P,I don’t do kind gestures for someone until I know them well enough in person.
7631,E,S,T,P,"Just be yourself.. get to know your estp. Be interested and share your world too. Help your estp be the better version of him or herself and when that person talks to you, really listen. You prob already do that. So just keep at it and it’ll all work itself out. If it’s meant to be then happy days are ahead!"
7632,E,S,T,P,"Ive only had 1 heart break. Ive been in situations where I had to move on from people and it only hurt for a bit. I wouldn’t call those a heartbreak. My reasons for moving on though has always been because it was a toxic relationship. It’s not like someone said something that caused an argument and a fight grew and there was a split. That’s just childish. But anyways with the heart break, I was fully committed to this person. And even though that became a toxic relationship too, we really tried to make it work. After we broke up i tried to be just friends. Not a good idea. We completely broke contact for 2 years and after that he called me up saying sorry and he was crying and blah blah.. but in those 2 years I had pursued a career and got busy becoming who I wanted to be. I wanted to have a strong character and wanted people to perceive me a certain way. It wasn’t until he called me that I realised I had changed. I’m always looking for growth. And I use every hard time as an opportunity to refine me to be someone more. I wouldn’t say it’s an ESTP thing. We all have the opportunity to be more than who we were a year ago."
7633,E,S,T,P,Do you remember what was the more populated personality type?
7634,E,S,T,P,It’s crazy to me how often this question comes up! Just be yourself yo! Have self respect and have fun.. am I right??
7635,E,S,T,P,Why do you wanna know?
7636,E,S,T,P,I didn’t know that was a trait that ESTP’s specifically can develop. I’m not worried about it though. I think anybody can develop traits related to sociopathy or psychopathy. What happens early on in your life has a lot to do with who you become as an adult.
7637,E,S,T,P,I’ve always believed I can do anything and then it’s true. I don’t even think about it. I just do it. Now I’m more honest with myself depending on what the task is but.. I hate excuses for not being capable of doing something if it is possible for someone else.
7638,E,S,T,P,Yeah that’s true of me. I’m more old school though
7639,E,S,T,P,Is it pretty easy to feel like you’re not accepted by someone?
7640,E,S,T,P,And what kind of connection is that?
7641,E,S,T,P,Does it bother you a lot when someone you know pretty good gets you wrong?
7642,E,S,T,P,Nah he’s an INTJ :)
7643,E,S,T,P,Nice! What city? What are you into? I live in New Zealand so being in the outdoors is my happy place
7644,E,S,T,P,"I agree!! 
I’ve noticed too every personality type has that thing that gets them down. For us, I think we just wanna play but being an adult gets in the way. We’re never gonna be kids again. But you can make long life friends again. Reaching out and having a variety of friends for different levels of fun to share. As we grow and get older we appreciate people that know how to keep it real. I remember always inviting different people to come do stuff with me in what I wanted to do. Now I do what everyone else wants to do, which I think has slowly chipped away at me. my adventurous side is still there. So I’m going to start reaching out to people and make plans. You should too! If you have a family, be the group activity leader. If you’re truly extroverted, seeing them enjoy themselves will fuel you into doing more! It’s just a matter of being balanced about it. Where do you live?"
7645,E,S,T,P,"So if you go over all the comments, the few things each one has in common is that we all aren’t being our true selves. I’m almost positive that we all crave to be around people and share moments with them. We just don’t want it to be with the wrong friends maybe? I suddenly become my happiest around kids because all they wanna do is play! And really, so do I! I currently am always around people that I try to understand but they don’t do that back. ( I live in a different country on top of that so it gets hard at times) So when it comes to hanging out, I find that I don’t have as much things in common and it makes me hold my sudden joys to myself. I don’t share random thoughts or music or moments with people anymore. Which I’m realising is bad for me. Feeling isolated and lonely in company is a bad circles to start."
7646,E,S,T,P,I feel like I still have a good amount of friends but I don’t keep in contact like I use to. I just don’t want drama anymore. Not that I wanted it but I feel like I was always hearing peoples problems and kinda life coaching while I was trying to live my life too. I was always making plans and getting out and sharing times with friends. I’m wondering if it’s the lack of socialising with people that I was once close to that really know me. How long has it been since you’ve hung out with your friends like you use to?
7647,E,S,T,P,"That’s so crazy you’re saying this cuz I feel exactly the same way!! Man its nice to know it’s not just me! im slowly finding my happy but i had to let myself cry just so that I can think clearly. 
I had to ask myself these questions..
When were you your happiest? What are you doing now that’s so different from then? When was the last time you took a break from being an adult and just finding what’s fun? Do you recognise what sends a charge through your body that makes you want to explode with so much joy and share it with somebody? 
Do you feel like you have a sense of purpose? 
For me, I’m starting to recognise what has been toxic in my life. I remember being my happiest when I hardly made any money but it was enough to pay my bills and all you can do is chill with your friends. I know living the teen life style comes across irresponsible but I’m focusing on the fact of how simple it was. And it was easy to find the fun things. Being able to afford my adult toys hasn’t brought joy to me. It’s good for an adrenaline rush but.. it’s just not enough anymore. 
If I’m not being specific or helpful enough I’m sorry. I just know it sucks to feel stuck and I wanna help if I can"
7648,E,S,T,P,"Look I’m not a dude but I really think it’s important to be yourself. Don’t try to be someone you’re not because the relationship will be based on who he thinks you are. in the end you’re going to be the one who’s unhappy and you could resent him for it. It’ll show up in your sex, how you care for him down the road, where your priorities are in your partnership. later on if you weren’t being honest in your relationship the whole time he could potentially resent you for it too. 
Again just be yourself. Be a really good friend in showing interest in his life and share your life too. Look for ways to grow as a person all the time and have expectations. If you guys want the same things in life and share common interests, then the rest will sort itself out."
7649,E,S,T,P,My brother is really into personality types and stuff and he had me take a quiz to see what I am. But instead answering the questions like it’s a regular test he sat with me for every single question and walked me through scenarios to see what my true answer would be. And then when I read about the ESTP type I started laughing cuz it was all true!
7650,E,S,T,P,I’m a barber and this one time that a regular sat in my chair said “I like coming to you because you’re so chill and I can relax but I also like that you’re strong.”
7651,E,S,T,P,Ok hit me!
7652,E,S,T,P,Yeah what the heck 😆
7653,E,S,T,P,Do you reply in a video or text?
7654,E,S,T,P,They as in the few that represent all ESTP’s?
7655,E,S,T,P,Yeah no.. Same!
7656,E,S,T,P,"Honestly I think it depends on how everyone grew up. I personally love sharing! Food, people, experiences, things. Unless it’s with someone I don’t like. But I notice when it’s comes to sharing people, I have a hard time sharing someone I’m really close that I have to fight their attention for. Just as an example, when my best friend was dating her husband and for the times I was around, I was pretty much invisible. And since I like sharing experiences, trying to share a moment or a laugh with someone im really close to but couldn’t be heard was really hard for me."
7657,E,S,T,P,Yo yes! I forgot I like his movies!!
7658,E,S,T,P,I’m really liking old stupid funny movies more and more. But I haven’t seen the naked gun or hot shot movies. I’ll check it out!
7659,E,S,T,P,"I love the Marx Brothers!! Aren’t they slapstick? I should’ve written old school slap stick. Comedies today hardly impress me anymore. 
I’ll have to check out the other movies you wrote."
7660,E,S,T,P,"I’m like, all the above but it changes which one I want more in the moment. Ill focus hardcore on my financial future and I’ll be on the good road to paying off debt and having a decent savings.. then all hell breaks loose and Ill buy adult toys and gear and plan trips .. then I’ll grow up again and make a checklist to get back on track and focus on what I could have if I don’t mess this up again."
7661,E,S,T,P,"So I can only speak from the experiences I have with 2 INFJ friends that I know pretty well and one I’m really close to. And something I’ve learned is once you’re in with them, it’s for all the good reasons. Like, if you connect on a deeper level and equally show care and consideration for each other and if you share the same values and can have good laughs and cries and they see you are genuinely good with everyone else too.. then this creates trust in the relationship and yo, once you have their loyalty.. you’ve got a friend you do not want to lose!
So who I was when I 1st met the 1st INFJ friend, I was happy to put all my energy into being caring to everybody and all that goes with it. But something that will always be true is there are people who will take advantage of kindnesses and so, for me, I learned to be choosy with who I show that level of care for because if I’m going to risk feeling hurt or taken advantage of, then i will do it with people I feel safer with. Where as INFJs will rather feel hurt than cause hurt to someone else. As far as I know INFJ’s will be the 1st to put themselves last and be the 1st to show any kind of kindness. But for a deep friendship they have to see and experience a compilation of reasons for someone to gain their beautiful friendship. The 2nd INFJ friend I have hasn’t known me for as long as the 1st one has and I’m a really guarded person now. So I haven’t given her much for her to feel she can let me be a part of her life all that much. And even then, when I had the chicken pox she made it her business to take care of me as much as possible. So are they heartbreakers? No. They are definitely more likely to get their heart broken than someone else."
7662,E,S,T,P,"Yeah no. whoever that was is super insecure! Even when you have nothing to hide, that person shouldn’t feel he/she has the right to know every little thing about you through your stuff. That just sounds suffocating and toxic"
7663,E,S,T,P,"Who here has been scrolling thorough comments dumbfounded?? 

48k a year.. barber"
7664,E,S,T,P,"Ohh ok.. yeah I’ve caught her at the wrong time. It.wasn’t.good. 👀 
But I’ll take on board everything you’ve written. It’s nice to get help in what I don’t always get."
7665,E,S,T,P,"It’s questions I’ve had for a while. Just observations I’ve made overtime.
I don’t really know how to explain what I mean by my 4th question. But someone did explain him/herself pretty well so based on what was said and I’ve seen, it makes a little more sense."
7666,E,S,T,P,"I read both of your comments and I really appreciate how thorough you were with answering as well as you did. Sorry for not replying sooner I was just taking in everything everyone wrote. I’m definitely going to follow your advice on just being myself. It’s just weird that we’ll get along so good and then randomly she’ll flip a switch. And it makes me give her her space. And when I try to just share a random thing that interested me, she will look at me and not reply or she’ll just go back to being on her phone almost instantly. And if I try to draw her out and show interest in what she’s up to, she gives me such a short reply and I have nothing to feed off of. And I go into logic mode and just leave the room. To me there is no point in sharing my interests with someone who’s doesn’t seem interested at all. I could blame it on her not having a good day and I can easily forgive that. But the way she is with our other flatmate makes me think she really doesn’t want a friendship"
7667,E,S,T,P,This is really cool!
7668,E,S,T,P,Thanks for saying it straight
7669,E,S,T,P,"I’m sorry. I’m just trying to understand. With your last comment, I hope I don’t come across entitled in my relationships. But that was a comment i needed to read.
I understand that we’re all different and I like giving people the freedom to be who they honestly are. And what I’ve noticed with INFJ’s specifically is they are sincerely really good people. They make me want to be better. Treating people with genuine kindness is what I practice. And for the people that are as good as the INFJ’s in my life, I think they deserve at least appreciation. It just sucks when those signs of appreciation feel unwanted and sometimes pushed away."
7670,E,N,F,P,"It's still pretty obvious with a bit of observation, all the functions are there even if they're not being consciously developed & expressed."
7671,E,N,F,P,That became my stance after I saw teh dragonfly alien p0rn!
7672,E,N,F,P,I think Andre’s an ENFP for sure.
7673,E,N,F,P,LMFAO XD

7706,I,N,T,P,"In the comment you linked, romainl actually explained exactly why he responds the way he does. He was clearly very angry and it came through in his language, but he's seen so much of the aftermath of people pushing their Perfect Vim Config ™ on others that, I think, he's simply had enough.

People often come here and to other forums with questions about why Vim is behaving in some unexplainable way, and after everyone answers, ""uh, Vim doesn't do that,"" it's eventually revealed that they're using someone else's config that they never bothered to read which changes a fundamental behavior of Vim. And like romainl pointed out, the original author of that config is not around to offer a helping hand or issue the appropriate disclaimers.

It would be nice to have people come here with good questions whose answers would actually benefit the community, and not just the noise of people suffering from someone else's config. If that takes discouraging people from making posts that share all of their Vim config marketed as something generally reusable, then so be it.

If you're proud of something you accomplished with your Vim config, then share that. Explain what it does, when it's appropriate to use, its caveats, etc.

Don't lure in the user who's been looking for a good minimalist config to start with if that's not actually what you're offering."

This was a huge mistake, it seems. He didn’t want me working, since he worked from home and didn’t want the risk, so I had nothing to do all day but sit around and wait for him to pay attention to me. It was brutal.
Coupled with the fact that he’s separated from his very manipulative, mentally ill wife and she calls at least once a week and texts more often, I was anxious all the time. And he was getting frustrated more easily. More shut down, too. More things kept surfacing, issues that were unresolved. It was horrible. For both of us.

I know I was too clingy, but the situation had a big hand in that. He had been long distance with his wife for years, so he was used to living alone. I wasn’t. I craved company.
As if this wasn’t enough, my little brother died completely unexpectedly in his sleep a month after I moved away. 21 years old. No cause of death.

One day, after a couple bad weeks, he dumped me. Spent 13 hours crying and talking before he says he hadn’t expected me to get up so early and question his love for me. He hadn’t set out to dump me. But something had to change. I agreed. So we decided to keep trying.

But a month later, after securing a job and about to start it, I just had this sinking feeling in my stomach anytime I thought about the relationship. So I told him and at first we agreed to go on a break for like a year or something. Wait for the separation to end and the split to be finalized, wait for us both to get some therapy. But as he dropped me back off at my parents’ house, we said we’d just try long distance again.

It’s been a month. I was there for 3. It’s been incredibly difficult and lonely. He clearly doesn’t love me as much as he used to. He’s more distracted than he used to be. Not as romantic or affectionate. We met up this past weekend for the first time and it was lovely, but he admitted that he’s worried the therapist he’s about to meet with will tell him he shouldn’t be in a relationship right now, coming right off a 23 year long marriage. And I get that. And I sometimes think about that, too.
I worry he does love me, but doesn’t want to be in the relationship anymore.

It all sucks. A lot. And idk what to do.

I still don’t see it as a favor to do a transaction with someone. You either do it or don’t. Or charge more for it if it’s such a hassle. It’d be a favor if you did it for cheaper or nothing at all or if you expedited the service cause they want it quicker. Just accepting a business request isn’t doing someone a favor.

As for the storm, we’re not just talking about a venue. We’re talking about a house that OP wants to move into and is sentimental to them. So yeah, I’m pretty sure a storm destroying it would make them unhappy.

I never said it was ok for people to harrass OP. I even said OP was NTA. I just think it sucks for the people that had booked the venue and now won’t be able to get married there.

It’s unfortunate that families have made this a tradition, but it’s not your duty to keep it open to the public for events.

If you really care about him, you need to set him down and have a serious, possibly long talk. Even if it’s over skype or something (which isn’t ideal, but covid). Plan out your words, give good examples of her shenanigans.
Otherwise, it’ll be hard for you to stay close friends with him with her in the picture (when she’s acting horribly).

If you’re fine to battle this out and stick around and butt heads with her, that’s ok, too. It’s your choice.

Or you can back up completely and tell him you’ll be around when he needs you, but that you can’t be around her."

It doesn’t seem like you made any real effort to get the two to get along.

She’s your friend, of course she’s going to worry about you. She wasn’t somehow a bad person because she suggested you break up. If she were telling you that every day, then sure, you can be upset with her.

9 months is an incredibly short amount of time, in the grand scheme of things.

If you're face camping or tunneling hard or going for the uber slug, of course people aren't going to be happy. Why does that make them salty?

I've never actually left a comment on a profile, cause there isn't really a point. Most of the time, if I have an issue with a killer, I say so in post game. And almost no matter what, it's just them being rude back or denying doing things or even being PROUD of playing like a jerk.

7785,I,N,F,J,"I had at least one dream like that early in my relationship. 

I think around that time, let’s say he was considering a career choice that involved living abroad for long periods of time (and it wasn’t gonna be safe). 

I already knew that if he made that decision, it would be the end of our relationship, because I knew how unhappy I would be in a long distance relationship. 

I was trying to be supportive for him, but I just couldn’t be happy for him. I love him, I didn’t want to break up, but I also didn’t want him to go abroad. 

Just to make things more difficult, our roommate and mutual friend at the time, she had no problem being happy for him. Obviously, cause she didn’t care, I don’t blame her.

Seeing her enthusiasm just made me feel guilty.

So around that time, I had a dream that he cheated on me with her. When I woke up, I told him (in the kitchen). Lol poor guy he apologized, he didn’t do anything. 

And then, (*fun story*) soon after, my roommate woke up and  she said we she was pregnant in her dream. I had to tell her my dream to explain what we thought was so funny.

We laughed it off, then she asked me if I was angry at them in the dream. 

I said no, just disappointed. We stared at each other.

And in that moment I felt really close to both of them. 

I feel a bit nostalgic thinking about it, that was years ago. (Also he changed his mind about the career choice for his own reasons really shortly so it never became a problem.) 

So I think the insecurity I felt is what triggered that dream."

7801,I,N,F,J,"Music is universal because it exists in every society (both with and without words), varies more within than between societies, regularly supports certain types of behaviour, and has acoustic features that are systematically related to the goals and responses of singers and listeners. 

AND sometimes music “works” BECAUSE we accept it ad “working” and no other reason. That’s why detuning, sampling, and honestly anything can potentially “work” in the right context. 


Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. It has to “work” or “not work” and only then you can use music theory as a guide to make sense out of why something works or won’t work. 

Wouldn’t it make more sense to say sound is universal?

Solutionism is problematic because it usually frames the racism that is part of music theory’s racialized structures as a disease that can be cured, rather than as a structure that needs dismantling (racism is a structure, not a disease).(2) Of course we should seek solutions to the problems created by our racialized structures, but we must also reframe how we understand race in music theory, which we cannot do if we rush to find solutions to problems we do not yet understand or even acknowledge. Only through examining our racialized structures and how they shape the field can we begin the process of deframing and reframing music theory’s white racial frame. With this work, I begin to uncover some of the uncomfortable aspects of what we do in hopes of moving toward a more inclusive version of music theory.”

7805,I,N,F,J,"Also Phil Ewell’s point “I posit that there exists a “white racial frame” in music theory that is structural and institutionalized, and that only through a deframing and reframing of this white racial frame will we begin to see positive racial changes in music theory.”

This is not a threat against you, just an invitation to restructure the way music theory is taught and more importantly, I realize now, we need to change the way it is used to analyze who is a musical genius or not. That’s not even why the system was invented in the first place.

He says “: For over twenty years, music theory has tried to diversify with respect to race, yet the field today remains remarkably white, not only in terms of the people who practice music theory but also in the race of the composers and theorists whose work music theory privileges. In this paper, a critical-race examination of the field of music theory, I try to come to terms with why this is so.”

So its like we are trying to diversify but it is difficult and he is trying to examine why it is so difficult to do so. Why is it so complicated and difficult to be inclusive? That’s an interesting point. 

You should not feel bad for using music theory the way you learned it though, I think that’s beside the point. And like yeah I don’t think teachers need to start turning their music class into an identity politics class. Maybe some else wants that, but I don’t think that’s the point Neely and Ewell are making.

I’m starting to read the article. I’m glad Neely brought up this professor, smart guy."
7806,I,N,F,J,"I agree with you that it shouldn’t be the ONLY reason. 

There’s just a lot of people who were overlooked and our teachers are responsible to learn about them and give us more objective information. Advocate based on talent yes, but also make an effort to look out for different kinds of talents too. From different backgrounds. Different perspectives. 

Hopefully you don’t give up on Neely because he talks about race. This definitely got us thinking and talking a lot :) I wish you the best."
7807,I,N,F,J,"“Please be honest”

I will use this expression in the future. Well said."
7808,I,N,F,J,"Be you need to accept that historically women were not taught, black people were not taught. And now we realize that it wasn’t because they were not as relevant to be taught. It was not because they were not worthy. It was only because others were racist and discriminatory. It’s important to make an effort and listen to other perspectives, while also appreciating Bach for example, because you’re allowed to like whatever you like. Neely loves Bach and he really makes that point clear. It’s not a boycott. There’s nothing wrong with his message. And it’s mainly about an article that Phil wrote (and I didn’t read it yet! I will eventually), but I feel like he is just trying to amplifying voices. 

And I think you should try to finish the video. Or at least listen to the conclusion. Neely is white too. He’s doing some introspection here and it’s not easy. He’s getting criticized for that kind of stuff. It’s super taboo. It’s good that you are willing to sacrifice a bit of your peace of mind to have this discussion about inclusiveness and diversity. It’s not possible unless we talk together. 

When I clicked on that video, I was just thinking “well duuuh” but actually I didn’t know anything about what he talked about yet. 

Like the part about figured bass for example. 

Just give it a chance. You didn’t choose your white skin, and I promise he’s not trying to accuse you of anything, he’s actually teaching us new information, and challenging our perspective. And then in conclusion he opens the discussion. Because it’s still worth talking about the many different aspects.

You know, after watching it, at first I was surprised he didn’t make it more about Christianity, but then I realized it would have made it even more complicated! 45 minutes is actually not enough in my opinion to cover such a sensitive and complex issue. But as a musician he has to so some introspection because he is using black culture. He’s trying to do the right thing. But it’s not your fault that things are the way they are. It’s about why they are the way they are. 

You don’t have to agree with everything he says. It doesn’t make you a racist. It’s okay to be skeptical. Also it’s not true to say that music is universal, some cultures define music differently, and we need to respect that what we feel is universal might actually not translate at all to someone else. It’s limiting to look at it like that. And it’s just not true, and we should stop teaching music theory like that. It’s not actually useful to my opinion."
7809,I,N,F,J,"Yeah, approaching it like this is way more useful for me. That’s not how it was taught to me, so I had to figure that one out eventually."
7810,I,N,F,J,"Everything is about race when you’re born in a society where you’re not the standard. 

When I started songwriting, it was always by ear.    I sing, and I can play some piano. As I learned to write songs, I learned a bit of music theory to make sense out of it. I have this weird love-hate with music theory like, it’s a tool until it’s in the way of my creativity. This video makes me feel better for having harmonically weird songs. 

Also it made me want to listen to more Northern Indian music. 

Music isn’t universal. But. Our predisposition for music is universal. We all (with few exceptions) have the potential to sing, dance, perform an instrument, starting from a young age. People a lot of times in Western music feel like they  have failed, because of how limiting music teaching can be. You’re connected to all the cultures you were exposed to in your life. 

But yeah that’s the point. We’re having a discussion wether you like it or not. If I was in school I could show all this to my teachers and ask for a change.

To my opinion it’s worth 45 minutes because it’s informative. Stop being afraid of the word racist, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Even people of color have to think about internalized racism because of the way we are raised in this society. Because of the way society is built. Stop taking personally, it’s counterproductive. You’re only responsible for your actions. Which is learning the same damn things as everybody else? Don’t feel bad. Your guilt is in the way of you absorbing interesting information. 

Nobody asked you to be an advocate for it. Neely decided to be."
7811,I,N,F,J,"I know, as an aspiring songwriter, who is not in a high point in academia, I know what to do with that information in my personal projects. 

We are having a discussion. A lot of people didn’t know anything about this topic. We can bring awareness at least."
7812,I,N,F,J,"What bothers you about it? Do you feel guilt? Do you just wish we stopped making everything about race already? You don’t want things to change? It’s not your fault things are the way they are. And he’s just addressing a difficult reality. That you already acknowledged. 

It’s 45 minutes because it’s a more complex issue than “the ONLY reason why western music tradition is taught that way is due to pushing a white identity”. It’s a specific European style that happened to come from white people, and that style was pushed by other white people in such a way that we are still learning the same thing Today from that same perspective. And, he talks about WHY it’s relevant, and HOW to approach the topic, how we could learn other music theory systems and compare them to ours, instead of limiting the future of our culture by stubbornly shoving the same ideas again and again down the throats of every western kid who is trying to develop musicianship."
7813,I,N,F,J,"He doesn’t go on for 45 minutes saying the same thing. There is a lot of interesting information in this video. 

I didn’t know about North Indian theory, and the comparison was super interesting. I didn’t know about Schenker. There are other speakers in this video. I didn’t know Philip A. Ewell, and he talks about addressing the issue and I don’t care if people will close their eyes to the fact that non-whites have been disadvantaged for centuries,  it opens the discussion. It needs to be common knowledge. It’s not for a lot of people.

Honestly Neely just made me feel validated as a musician, as an artist. 

People are afraid of the word racist, we need to stop pretending. I’m mixed race, I look white, my brother looks brown. Privilege is complicated. Race is complicated.

 We need to keep the discussion open because it is wrong to think that western music is inherently superior to other cultures. It’s wrong to rape, but I swear there are people who will defend it.

I still think it’s important. You might want to look in the description of the video theres a table of contents. 

“The first step” is to acknowledge that western music theory is rooted in white supremacy and I guess your point is that we’ve already done that.  So there’s not point going on for 45 minutes.

Neely’s point is that there needs to be a change. And he gives many perspectives and resources to explore that. 

Music courses are only teaching a very specific slice of cultural music... that’s not ok. That is so limiting. It’s professors like Phil Ewell that make a difference. He even gives specific examples of what other music teachers could do to change this.

The fact that people are afraid of the word racist  or racism is just proof that we need to talk more.

7817,I,N,F,J,"I can’t hug my dead grandfather because he’s dead. When you die it’s not about you dying, it’s about people who will continue to live without your presence. I think that maybe we would not even have such a strong concept of life and death if it wasn’t about OTHERS entering and exiting what we call life.

Your feelings are real, your experience of your feelings are real. There is something as opposed to nothing. Things can happen to you while you are unconscious and you will have to accept reality if/when you become conscious again. Like if when you fall asleep on your arm and it wakes you up. 

You don’t know if other people’s experience is real. Better assume it is real and be considerate. We’re sharing this planet. We breathe the same air and drink the same water. Our trash crosses the oceans.

This makes me think of a interview with author Sally Rooney, and at some point talks about how she used to believe in independence (as a feminist it was important to her) only to realize later... independent from who?? *disclaimer, you really don’t need to

7818,I,N,F,J,"Try not to take it personally. People can have ALL kinds of reasons. 

What are your emotional boundaries? What would you say to someone who is interested in you and you didn’t feel the same? What do you think is the right thing to do? 

You can’t control who is interested in who. You can control how you communicate those feelings. Maybe then you will realize that you are not actually interested in inconsiderate assholes who will ignore someone with no explanation, not even a few words. 

A lot of people are just wandering, jumping from hookup to hookup without thinking much.

7819,I,N,F,J,"I think the same thing to myself about a lot of successful artists music and that didn’t stop them from being successful. Do you thing!

7820,I,N,F,J,Yeah true. Complicated and heartbreaking too. Friendship is more important to my opinion. Just maintaining communication with the people currently in my life is already a lot personally.

When I broke up with him after an actually pleasant week-end as couple, I said it’s because I could not see myself grow old with him. He responded with « so what? » and that is when I understood that I didn’t want to be in a exclusive and monogamous relationship unless we were mutually planning our futures together.

So yeah it’s better to be alone. Make friends. Be the person you wish to find. 

It’s better to be alone than to waste your energy and time on someone you’re not emotionally invested in (or vice versa). 

Also casual sex and/or cuddles is a legit option and can be very nice with a lot of communication and mutual respect. U really don’t need a partner, but it’s nice I won’t lie."

At that point, the best thing I can do is get to my home gym as quickly as humanly possible and just decimate my heavy bag, perform kata to exhaustion, or lift weights until I can’t move my arms.  

Rage has been a lifelong struggle I’m not very proud of, but it has come in handy on more than one occasion and had some benefits at the time.  One day I’ll get it under control and until then, it’s why some people think I hit ENTJ more than INTJ."

7863,I,N,T,J,True; didn’t know if the push was caused by the buildup or if the print didn’t adhere and that caused the buildup.  You’re probably correct though; I just need to watch the next go more closely.  I washed the plate and will buy some acetone the next time I’m in town.
7864,I,N,T,J,"Thanks for the tip!  What about the last print though?  The base adhered, but something built up exceedingly fast and started coating the hotend in PLA.  Could it have been a layer that just didn’t stick to the build and didn’t separate from the hotend?"
7865,I,N,T,J,"Okay, tried to print a small, heart-shaped box that was part of the introductory files about 20 minutes ago.  First layer went down alright and I can definitely see the heart shape.  Go back to check on the print after about 10 minutes and I see that the hotend has about a quarter-sized buildup of my PLA+ surrounding it and it’s proceeding to push the first layer around the bed while it does nothing but buildup more material...

I used the latest version of Cura to slice it and left it on the base settings for an Ender 5 Plus.

What am I doing wrong?"
7866,I,N,T,J,"I really appreciate it.

My end goal is to create cosplay armor for myself and my daughter, so I’ve got several files worth of things I want to try.

I tried printing the Monkey Cup that came with the ender, and that took about 5 or 6 prints before I was finally able to get it at 90% before it got pushed by the hot-end and knocked askew.

To get to that point I had to do crazy amounts of hairspray and glue stick because nothing would stick for very long.

I’ve got the bed heated to 70C and the hotend at 200C.  The ambient room temperature isn’t very warm...probably around 16C.  I didn’t mess with the speed and this was using the provided PLA material.  For leveling, I did the method of sliding a piece of paper until it caught a bit with the hotend.

Does this seem good so far?"
7867,I,N,T,J,"Sort of...I did tons of leveling, both manual and automatic.  For the most part, it has stopped, but it performs erratically sometimes still.  Trying to figure out why it’s doing this."

7893,E,N,F,P,That's a tall person problem? I'm 5'2 and my knees always stick out.
7894,E,N,F,P,Where did you get that jacket
7895,E,N,F,P,"ok but even if it was that only straight people watch porn, I still don't understand how this is ""not ok"""
7896,E,N,F,P,Also the assumption that only gay people can recognize when someone of the same gender is hot...
7897,E,N,F,P,"Well I bought it for him right? He doesn't look old enough to buy clothes by himself  
Why would I shame my son for wearing clothes I bought him"

7901,E,N,F,P,"But also the cookies n cream twix is bullshit, at least imo. The cookie part is no different from the normal one and the actual ""cream"" is absolutely tasteless. Just get a regular one if you want a twix"
7902,E,N,F,P,He was self-taught and it shows
7903,E,N,F,P,"Literally takes more time and effort to do shit like this too. Like, the guy either went back and fourth each time he put down a word, or he had to make a mental note of which words go after which."
7904,E,N,F,P,Is it just me though are does Antartica just look like a dog with a narwhal tooth?
7905,E,N,F,P,Idk I thought it was kinda funny

7908,E,N,F,P,"Pretty much, yeah. I didn't really mean to say anything against your post necessarily, but against the disagreement about what the difference is exactly between bisexual and pansexual that I've just been seeing constantly lately, as it's been really mentally draining for me. I probably shouldn't have put this under your post and I could have waited, that was pretty stupid of me. I could delete it if you want"
7909,E,N,F,P,"Can we stop trying to search for a difference in definition just to justify the existence of the pan label? You can identify with it, not many people really care. Even most battleaxe bis don't have a problem with actual pansexuals. But you can't say they aren't the same thing. People can have their own meaning for their own label, but bi was never exclusive.

Don't try to dictate what someone else's word means just to feel more comfortable within your own. Let everyone live."
7910,E,N,F,P,Oh nooo not men wearing clothes that men wore back in the day!

7922,E,N,F,P,"Doesn't even say ""boys"" or ""girls"" anywhere on the package- Sure, a boy is on the blue one and a girl is on the pink one, but lets be honest, on average, girls are more likely to want the pink one, and boys with blue.  
You're the only one pointlessly gendering it."

7925,E,N,F,P,"It's still pretty bad compared to p much every other year the current population has experienced  
every year from the 500s would be the worst if it was us living in it. The world evolves and people deal with less shit as time goes on, that should be a good thing"
7926,E,N,F,P,"Not always, it's a pretty loose term  
there's a reason terfs are called ""trans exclusionary radical feminists"" and not ""trans exclusionary radical non-feminists"""

7981,E,N,F,P,thoughts on video editing audios? LIKE I LOVE LISTENING TO THEM AND JUST GETTING CAUGHT UP IN IDEAS AND IMAGINE IM IN LIKE A MUSIC VIDEO AH! I JUST LOVE IT
7982,E,N,F,P,"okay wait but would this be a good example of an Te-Bitch slap? 

him: 1# women aren’t funny #2 people who chose to be fat fucks and need Walmart scooter carts

me: i don’t think anyone chooses to be funny *fat 
that’s just like kinda fucking rude 
idk what you have against fat ppl or whatever but like keep that shit to urself lol, it rlly just sounds like ur body shaming ngl
like literally in our society being skinny is so sought after the amount of ppl w eating disorders is insane. nobody is choosing to be overweight, nobody wants to move around in a scooter

him: I body shame people

me: nice 

him: People need to be healthy

me: so? you can be fat and healthy and not everyone can become healthy that easily

him: Fat people are detrimental to society. Look at lizzo

me: i rlly hope ur joking bc that was a disgusting thing to say 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈

him: I just don’t get the Appeal of being overweight

me: there isn’t any appeal in being overweight what do you not understand about that lol. some ppl are built bigger. you can exercise and eat healthily and still be fat, ur just body shaming and being gross.
there is a huge difference between wanting everyone to be obese and not hating on ppl based off of their weight. saying that you would treat someone with less respect simply bc of their weight is GROSS. 

him: I would want them to improve themselves. I just feel gross when after I’ve eaten a lot and feel kind of fat when I look at myself. So I can’t fathom what it must feel like to be overweight

me: well that’s what you think about yourself, like yeah it must rlly suck, but also if they’re doing the best they can they don’t need to be body shamed for it. like you can be beautiful and fat they aren’t mutually exclusive

him: Uhhh
I can’t say I’ve ever seen a beautiful fat person

me: well that’s too bad for you

him: And it’s not like I would laugh at fat people at the gym

me: kay so u would be a decent human being??  like isn’t that just common sense?

him: I’m proud of people who want to improve themselves

me: but sometimes you can’t improve yourself to get to a point that’s satisfactory at least to your standards. and like bruh the prospect of gaining weight and becoming “fat” is TERRIFYING to me
i literally cry over it a shit ton but i would NEVER EVER project my eating disorder and bad body image problems onto how i view other ppl. like that’s their body and like some ppl are just built bigger
and some ppl can’t afford the right foods or time to go to the gym

me: the expectation that everyone should be skinny and perfect is stupid and honestly super ignorant. you act as if everyone has time off and can afford healthy food, and keep proper diet and nutrition 
like what abt the families working to support their kids and have to work 3 part time jobs with no breaks in between and have an extremely limited budget to spend on food so that they don’t in the process sacrifice things like their house, bills, tuition, etc.
no one wants to be disabled and body shamed but if you genuinely do not posses enough empathy in your body to not discriminate against them simply bc just looking at them up and down you see that they’re overweight is rlly fucking sad
in the end if u choose to continue hating on fat ppl and body shaming them and saying this shit, that’s fine idc. do what you want, and it’s not like you owe me anything bc i’m not the one ur insulting here. just next time keep ur nasty ass opinion to yourself"

7985,E,N,F,P,i- WHY DID I SEE THIS AS SOON AS I STARTED A NEW PROJECT UM PLS
7986,E,N,F,P,our personalities are one big contradiction so i mean yeah lol. i mean we aren’t constantly getting mad or being manipulative but if we’re pushed far enough over the edge we can really explode.
7987,E,N,F,P,all cops are bastards :)
7988,E,N,F,P,awee!! all the entps i’ve met have made me cry at one point or another so i cant really relate

7990,E,N,F,P,"ESTJ’s are mean to literally everyone, so are ENTJ’s they terrify me. But this is so cute, i’ll always be here for any of my INTPs, y’all are so cute 🥺"
7991,E,N,F,P,"Tobio, sorry I should’ve been more clear"
7992,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP i feel attacked i’m leaving
7993,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP i feel quite attacked
7994,E,N,F,P,as an ENFP 8w7 we can be dangerous like that :/
7995,E,N,F,P,"me, an ENFP, trying to tell a story without interrupting myself and going on about how we should only travel by duck boats:"
7996,E,N,F,P,THANK YOU I FEEL V APPRECIATED I HOPE U HAVE AN AMAZING DAY AND WEEK AND YEAR
7997,E,N,F,P,what does it mean by tangible memories? that you live in the past or something?
7998,E,N,F,P,or an ENFP i think wait acc nvm we do be kinda introverted doe
7999,E,N,F,P,wait so what the hell? is this an ENFP thing or sumn? bc i was just talking abt how lucky i was for narrowly avoiding getting caught sleeping through class lol
8000,E,N,F,P,HSHEUSHJSNDKXOXO
8001,E,N,F,P,yeah pretty much
8002,E,N,F,P,oh- so i see how it is smh
8003,E,N,F,P,"yes, so true!! i did gymnastics when i was younger and LOVED it. i’m definitely still passionate abt volleyball :)"
8004,E,N,F,P,okay but like at kageyama being his socially awkward dorky self 🥺
8005,E,N,F,P,AND UR USERNAME UGH ICONIC
8006,E,N,F,P,"ikr bro, bc like i feel like only the rest of us ENFPs rlly understand how much of a walking contradiction we really are. like our personality makes no sense but like it was relieving to have someone be able to understand me yk"
8007,E,N,F,P,YES YES YES
8008,E,N,F,P,omg bro talking to other ENFPs is like having a conversation with yourself about yourself. that’s so weird it’s the exact same way for me
8009,E,N,F,P,there was this discord server and all of us hit it off instantly and then i asked them what personality type they were and it turned out we were all ENFPs haha
8010,E,N,F,P,wow didn’t need for you to come at me like that 🥴
8011,E,N,F,P,FR. like grr it’s so frustrating and ofc we can only “flirt” with the ppl we’re just trynna be friendly with and then just roast the ppl we acc wanna be with
8012,E,N,F,P,YES LITERALLY!! but then i also am super mysterious like i over share without actually over sharing any super personal information yk? it’s kind of all just surface level stuff but i’m actually hella secretive
8013,E,N,F,P,yep same. i can make friends with anyone but it also means that most of the friends i make i don’t rlly develop strong bonds with :(
8014,E,N,F,P,"yep i can totally relate, i’m struggling w the same issue so i don’t know how to give any good advice abt how to fix the issue sorry"
8015,E,N,F,P,never went into debt and am very careful with my money (MOST of the time) but the first few? yeah those rlly hit hard
8016,E,N,F,P,the only thing i want bfl
8017,E,N,F,P,"hey i’m also a jewish enfp!! anyways, ack that’s so awkward i’m so sorry. plus it’s even worse that we’re people pleasers so we can’t directly say that we were just being friendly."
8018,E,N,F,P,ty :)
8019,E,N,F,P,bahahahah i mean yeah i guess you could say that
8020,E,N,F,P,"it does tysm!! but ugh i wish it was easier to just be like “listen im not flirting with you, i’m just being myself. pls don’t get the wrong idea” any time i meet someone."
8021,E,N,F,P,"that’s fair, i mean it’s not exactly like i want them to be accurate bc i’d rather not let them know how to constantly make me feel attacked"
8022,E,N,F,P,I WAS JUST TALKING TO SOMEONE ABT HOW I THOUGHT KAORI WAS AN ENFP!! YESSS IM WINNING RN
8023,E,N,F,P,"HI OTHER ENFP HERE IK IM
LATE IM 16 U USE THE CAT EMOJI I LOVE YOU PLS BE MY FRIEND"
8024,E,N,F,P,so we’re psychotic... introverts??
8025,E,N,F,P,yes ❤️
8026,E,N,F,P,i was actually about to bring this up because i don’t really see us as being typed badly. like i mean yeah it’s frustrating for ppl to knit pick at our faults or kind of mislabel us but i don’t think we’re completely typed badly or mislabeled.
8027,E,N,F,P,you already know too much...
8028,E,N,F,P,i mean sometimes they are but these are all like super extreme versions so i don’t rlly feel called out since this is only me at my very worst (which isn’t often) so 🤷🏻‍♀️
8029,E,N,F,P,ah ty!! and yes we have terrible time mangement skills (i would know bc i’m an ENFP getting tutored about bettering my time management) & this is def something we need to work on. but anyways from an ENFP i apologize we suck when it comes to that
8030,E,N,F,P,"that’s definitely an ENFP thing, because i’m friends with multiple ENFPS and we’ll literally run ourselves into the ground with these kinds of conversations. everyone around me tells me i do this kind of stuff too, it’s a bad thing & i can’t really explain why i do it, even though i wish i could"
8031,I,N,T,P,Spidey sense
8032,I,N,T,P,#TEST
8033,I,N,T,P,If they are too stubborn then just ignore them and try to stray away from this topic if you still have to talk to them. It's hard to ignore someone when they are stubborn but sometimes you have to understand that the conversation you're having isn't going to be meaningful so just walk away
8034,I,N,T,P,"Tell them to f off then never take them seriously again
Edit: obviously don't say that to a teacher or a parent but like say something that kind of has the same meaning just less disrespectful"
8035,I,N,T,P,"then they make a zoom session asking why people are stressed out and depressed then at the end start making comments that make people feeling that way even worse like ""its so easy not to be stressed"" ""Just stop being sad and focus on work and it helps so much"""
8036,I,N,T,P,Yup plus sometimes like a needle like pain

8056,I,N,T,P,Thanks. I was recently diagnosed so I have been taking medication since then and it's helping but sometimes after being close to a trigger even after I use my preventatives inhaler it starts flaring up so I don't think it's that bad and I might be able to play

8075,I,N,T,P,"No but you can find a website called warmoth that makes custom guitar necks and bodies that you have to assemble so if you just ordered a custom neck all you'd need to do is get the tuners and screw the new neck instead of the first one.

They have many options including finishes materials frets scalloping (if you use modern scale length) scale length including Gibson style 24.5 (I think) modern which is a strat and baritone which is 27.

Their website is easy to use and they are based in Washington and they show estimated shipping cost to almost any country

Lastly their prices are pretty good. I designed a flame maple ebony neck with gloss finish modern scale length with jumbo frets and it was ~$500 but that was me just messing around.

I haven't personally bought something from them but I've designed and thought of it a lot but many YouTubers have used it."

8136,I,N,T,J,">S8 should have focused on a national manhunt over Dexter, forcing him to make difficult choices, ending with him making some sort of sacrifice and going to jail or something

See, the fact is: this should have happened early on after season four finale. Season five should have been about Dex losing his code because he can't deal with what happened to Rita. Then he gets caught killing an innocent by his sister in season five finale, then season six should have been about what you said, the manhunt and all"

8145,I,N,T,J,"It is interesting to note that the majority of us rated *I -> E*. I voted *J -> P* because a very great deal of my depression and anxiety steams from an absolutely compulsory need to control anything and everything around me! I could not care less about extroversion, cause I really like being a lone wolf.

8166,I,N,T,J,"Io ho una mia idea di destino, che in parte confuta la seconda parte dell'aforisma.
Ovvero, credo che ciascuno di noi abbia un destino, ossia un futuro determinato dalla nostra genetica e dalle nostre esperienze ambientali, un percorso che lo porta su una strada specifica, che è quella e quella soltanto.
Conoscere le proprie tendenze, anche quelle meno consce rendendole consapevoli, non significa avere in mano le chiavi del nostro destino; se per destino s'intende ciò che succederà nella nostra vita. Infatti, indipendentemente da ciò che noi _vogliamo_ o _progettiamo_ , il corso delle cose sarà uno e unico, quasi totalmente imprevedibile, ed inoltre pur facendo delle scelte (e delle scelte consapevoli), sono convinto che tali scelte non siano libere, bensì condizionate dall'ambiente circostante (cultura di riferimento) e dalla nostra storia ontologica (genetica e temperamento).
Certo, come ho ribadito, la consapevolezza di sé rimane comunque importantissima."

Diciamo che può risultare un aiuto per migliorare, ma bisogna poi sopportare di vedere parti di sé che si avrebbe fatto volentieri a meno di vedere, a volte."
8168,I,N,T,J,"Esatto. Credo che appunto tentando di conoscere se stessi (al massimo grado consentito dalla vita frenetica a cui siamo costretti), le persone possano ""puntare il dito"" un po' meno sugli altri e più su se stessi, smettendo di proiettare le proprie insicurezze, fragilità e oscurità personali sugli altri."

8189,I,S,F,P,Y'all really just don't get it huh smh
8190,I,S,F,P,Girl you are strong
8191,I,S,F,P,"I understand now what you mean, I have very similar thoughts atimes but religion helps me cope with them. Well I'd say go out to the mountains or somewhere out in nature and live out the rest of your days, basically the life an ascetic cause honestly I don't think there's escaping it when present in society."
8192,I,S,F,P,"I feel this way too. Career wise at least. Im not really ambitious, I do want to do things I just don't want to feel the pressure of having to be the best. Having to outdo myself. It's exhausting. Are you unhappy about having these feelings or is it you just can't stand it that people feel that way?"

8208,I,S,F,P,We both follow each other. We've just never talked in real life or on instagram.
8209,I,S,F,P,Nothing. Absolute silence 🤧 he didn't open it and my friend made me unsend the message. Instagram has that feature.

8218,I,S,F,P,Gee thanks a lot
8219,I,S,F,P,Idk okayyy this is just how I am! I'm looking for help here. What do I do?
8220,I,S,F,P,"You'll think I'm a nutcase but here goes:

I know I've crossed more than just one line sending this message but understand that I had too. the first time I came across your page was through a mutual friend, he had tagged us both in a post, I went through your page and it was your captions that got my attention, I thought they were absolutely beautiful. I felt they gave away a reflection of the kind of person that you might have been. I admired that person. I know people hate platitudes but one must come to terms with the fact that the only reason they're repeated a million times is because they're felt universally, and that makes them undoubtedly real, and so even though me saying I fell in love with your words might sound like a bs platitude, believe me, it was true and real. I contemplated messaging you. I didn't know what you looked like, for all I knew you could have been a middle-aged married man, I mean who in their twenties is that articulate and good with words anyway? and so even though I never dismissed the thought of you I did dismiss that of messaging you. eventually I did know what you looked like, you posted a picture and I'm sorry if it sounds rude to say but I was relieved to find that you weren't a middle-aged man and I guessed you weren't married, and so the thought of messaging you wasn't entirely at bay, but who am I kidding, I'd never go through with it. im a neurotic and an existentialist, and so even though we never talked and I never knew you on an individual level I was content to consider the whole thing as star-crossed, and I figured I'd move past it. but then I discovered your blog on medium, and I must say your articles painted an even better picture of the person I thought you were, and I admired you even more. of course at that point I wouldn't dare to think of messaging you, I mean you seem so knowledgeable and not that I'm not, I'm just not as nearly voluble as you seem to be, and I didn't really think I'd have much to say or offer. you seem so well versed of history and religion, these mainly played a major role in how I felt towards you. but then in the midst of all this my friend mentioned you. she mentioned that she'd messaged you. if I said I didn't care it'd be a lie. I felt unsteady but I could never say a word to her. I would never betray a friend. I feel terribly guilty messaging you but I needed to issue this expulsion. for closure. it helps I think. im not sure. I'm sorry if I've spoken out of terms with you but understand it was necessary. I don't expect a reply. I don't even want one. I just needed to speak freely. I tell you all this in confidence. I don't know you but you seem trustworthy so I trust you to keep this to yourself. if you've read this thank you for taking the time and I'm truly sorry for all this."
8221,I,S,F,P,I would but it's to late. I sent him an incredibly stupid message and now I'm just freaking out. I don't know what to do. He hasn't opened it yet. Im an extremely socially anxious person and when I like someone it's very hard for me to be normal. I don't know how to have casual conversations. It's always so intense. Can I share the message I sent with you here?
8222,I,S,F,P,Exactly. I agree with this.
8223,I,S,F,P,The Blackcoat's Daughter. It's one of the most disturbing and truly scary horror films I've seen recently.
8224,I,S,F,P,Good for you pal

8240,I,N,F,J,I used markers! However it wasn’t a good choice bc I only had alcohol-based markers and now there’s a stain on the other side of the  page:/ I guess it’d have been better if I had water-based markers instead
8241,I,N,F,J,it’s something that we usually do in Spain actually!
8242,I,N,F,J,tbh I took some brown envelopes that my mother had somewhere and I glued it. I don’t usually do it but on this BuJo I tried it few times and I like it! And that happens to me too! You can see in the photo lmao my native language is Spanish (there’s an X instead of an M because we use that on calendars in Spain so there’s no confusion between Martes and Miercoles) and we use the word “Spanglish” lol
8243,I,N,F,J,thank you so much! 💖
8244,I,N,F,J,"honestly I didn’t use to take this much effort on my BuJo but since this year I started it a little earlier (I usually start it with the school year) I decided to try to make it look a little bit prettier than usually and take some time to pick colors, use some other kind of paper, etc"
8245,I,N,F,J,"yeah it’s that lmao in spanish Tuesday is Martes and Wednesday is Miercoles, so in calendars we use the X for Miercoles so there’s no confusion. it’s kinda dumb tbh because obviously it’s Miercoles but I guess I’m just used to it lol"
8246,I,N,F,J,"that’s interesting! I’d saw the column way to do it before, but with that many habits to stick to I feel a little overwhelmed and end up doing nothing at all, and with just two of them that way I feel like it seems empty. so I decided that it was worth it for me to make two calendars! :)"
8247,I,N,F,J,"totally! for me having 7 or 8 habits to stick on is just too much, that’s why I’d never done this before. however the other day I saw a youtuber doing it this way and I loved the idea. also in my opinion this way looks better than the typical column habit tracker"
8248,I,N,F,J,"yeah my native language is Spanish but I write lots of things in English so my BuJo ends up being bilingual lmao
I don’t really have a reason to do this I just do it unconsciously"
8249,I,N,F,J,omg u’re so handsome I think I’m in love
8250,I,N,F,J,maybe a looping INFJ
8251,I,N,F,J,it’s me atm
8252,I,N,F,J,"Aw that’s cute, thank you<3 

I’ve always felt like INTJs and INFJs have a special connection - maybe bc of the dominant  Ni? or maybe just bc my boyfriend is an INTJ and I love him a lot lmao. so I can say that I love you too:)"

8258,I,N,F,J,"in fact the creator of the show said that they ARE a couple. he couldn’t see them otherwise, and they were an analogy of his own experience with his boyfriend. 

bad news is that idk if the producers or someone else said that it wasn’t completely true and blahblahblah just to keep the straights from losing it lol"
8259,I,N,F,J,"totally agree. and don’t forget when you lose weight and then, once you’re getting better and gaining your weight back, people comment it as something negative"
8260,I,N,F,J,I can actually see what he means. yeah he sometimes feels like a robot but that’s due to his social anxiety. he does understand other people and their motivations and also he has this kind of “superiority complex” that is such an Ni dominant stereotype bc we’re sO UniQUe AnD SpEciAl
8261,I,N,F,J,"I sometimes feel this way or something similar like being skinny /is/ feminine. and it makes me feel kinda bad bc I’m a trans boy so I don’t wanna be feminine at all but I wanna be skinny and I end up feeling dysphoric and invalid about my ED lol

I know that this feeling is bc of the stereotype that only girls can have EDs and that stuff but idk it still makes me feel at least weird in a bad way

(I’m not blaming you for making me feel bad or anything - in fact you didn’t, this is something that I thought about before and we’re just sharing our opinions. I don’t wanna sound offended)"
8262,I,N,F,J,"it’s weird bc I have social anxiety and public speaking terrifies me - like my legs literally start to shake and I may even start to hyperventilate. but the “idea” of speaking in public, if I didn’t feel this way, seems more comfortable bc I know what I’m gonna say and I know my purpose there. idk if this makes any sense lol"

8264,I,N,F,J,"I’ve always felt like Evan does everything he does “for Connor” more for himself. after all he never really met Connor, so it’s almost impossible for him to care that much about Connor. he thinks he’s talking to Connor and that’s what motivates him to start “the Connor Project”, but actually he’s just talking to himself bc he feels bad about lying to Larry, Cynthia and Zoe so it’s a way to “compensate” it. after that he continues with it bc of all that he gained, he doesn’t want to lose that family, his girlfriend... so he just keeps lying to the point that he almost loses his actual family and his actual friends (“Good for you”)"
8265,I,N,F,J,"yeah I kinda know what you mean. I feel like they just don’t get me at all, they don’t completely understand how I think or how I connect things etc. 

It’s funny bc few days ago I was with my family at the beach and I just thought about this. I felt like they just went with me bc they had to and not bc they really wanted to. We love each others tho, I guess that’s what families do lmao"
8266,I,N,F,J,"ohh this is so nice!!

but honestly i find it kinda weird bc i thought that poland was super lgtbiphobic? maybe i’m wrong tho, if someone could clarify this to me. i’m kinda confused bc as far as i know the gov (and even the people) was against the lgtbi rights. anyway, even if that’s true, then this is even more reason to celebrate! it’s even a more significant victory!!!"
8267,I,N,F,J,entj? not sure tho i’m not really good at typing lol
8268,I,N,F,J,"it’s hard to tell just with this... that test isn’t quite accurate tho, try with this one if you have some time! https://sakinorva.net/functions"
8269,I,N,F,J,"yeah I know the i/e meaning doesn’t change. it’s just that i don’t know how to apply it to the N.
 
as far as I know, an e function is focused on the “outside world”, the others, etc, while an i function is more about yourself and your “inner world”. and i know how to use that with the T, F and S. but it’s hard for me how to see at first how to apply it to the N, since it’s about seeing patterns and making connections and idk. 

although some people answered me and gave me examples so i think i got it now:)"

8273,I,N,F,J,hot mulligan has become one of my fav bands tbh I discovered them some months ago and I just feel like all of their songs rock! I really see a great future ahead for them
8274,I,N,F,J,"actually I think that reducing sex to male/female is also incorrect. sex is something that humans learn (that’s why our first times lots of times sucks and we get better at it, for example, while most animals don’t (I actually don’t know if any other animal does that lol)), and there are also intersex people, so I don’t think that humans experiment biological sex as other animals do. also, as a society, we interact with other people with our gender (identity, expression, etc.), so nowadays our “biological sex” is not that important - why do people have the need to know what do I have between my legs, you know? that’s why I feel disappointed when people say male/female humans, and I feel it just leads to more transphobia.    (obviously we have sex features, I’m not trying to say that we don’t, don’t get me wrong. I just feel like it’s something more individualized than as we tend to see it, it’s deeper than just being male/female)

besides, if I’m trans and I’m talking about my gender, why do I have to refer to my sex when saying ftm? and if I’m a trans man but I don’t wanna get the bottom op, then I’m not ftm? I hope you get my point"
8275,I,N,F,J,"I actually don’t use them at all. if I wanted to clarify, I’d just say I’m a trans man"
8276,I,N,F,J,"I was gonna say ENFP bc even tho Fi is higher than Ne, I can see the Si inferior there? idk but agree on xNFP"
8277,I,N,F,J,people are saying xstj but tbh i see the “being-an-asshole”-thing something that is directly related to Fi. i’m gonna say esfp - i still can see that tertiary Te working tho
8278,I,N,F,J,that’s part of the problem. i don’t even know how to explain it or how to start. would you mind if i sent you a dm?
8279,I,N,F,J,"visionary + explorer made me think of Ne, while i always associated intelectual with the T (also, with explorer I can see the Ti somehow?? I’m more doubtful of this last part tho)"

8285,I,N,T,J,"I did this all the time, ever since I was a smol bean. I still do stuff like this. It's called skillz. Lol jkjk"
8286,I,N,T,J,"We normally find comfort in things similar to us. This includes looks (which is why some couples look like siblings), personality, behaviour, style, religion, etc. This can be on purpose or not, like with looks, it can be subconscious. We look similar to our parents and have similar personality and behaviour traits to them because they raised us and we share genes with them. 

We also find comfort with things familiar to us, and since most people are with their parents for a long time, especially childhood where they are impressionable, our parents become very familiar to us.

When growing up, many people go through a thing where they like their opposite sex parent and start getting jealous of their same sex parent (not sure how it is for non straights). This is totally normal and healthy for a child.

I think it also depends on how we view our parents, our relationship with them, and the personality of our parents. What I said about parents having similar personality traits to their children isn't 100%, it's just more common to share traits with parents cuz yknow, biology. But not everyone is similar to their parents, I'm very different from my father but similar to my mother.

In general, I think you look for someone who seems familiar and similar to you, and your parent fits perfectly, which is why we subconsciously look for someone like our parents. Someone familiar and similar to you would be comfortable because you know what to expect (albeit this might be subconsciously). This kinda explains a bit of racism in a way ig? Lol :D.

It's too bad I can't talk to ppl irl about MBTI in person since none of my friends rlly do it. The person who introduced it to me just thought of it as a normal personality test. I do show her and my other gal pal memes tho. 

Also, I've never heard of CS Joseph, but I've heard of objective personality (never read it tho). Anyway, thanks. :D"

8332,E,N,T,P,I'll up it to $70 and agree with you. Makers private selects are *usually* too good for me to pass up.
8333,E,N,T,P,Shhhhhh.... let them obsess. Im happy to keep paying $30 for my knob creek and having easy access to the specialty bottles they put out.
8334,E,N,T,P,"Disagree for sure. There are $25 mass produced bottles  better than almost every craft $60-80 bottle ive had. Love supporting local, but not in regards to whiskey anymore."
8335,E,N,T,P,"Well if you're talking ethanol yeah... 12 year whiskey vs 4 year whiskey is way different chemically speaking. Plus the chemistry from distillation is also different based on the cuts, there's different concentration of flavor and aroma compounds in the higher end stuff.. Higher amounts of sugar and tannin and flavor compound for are different too based on aging and quality of the oak you use. 

If youre talking about ethanol being the same in each... well yeah, with that idea then technically bourbon is no different than rum or vodka or gin or tequila or anything else for that matter. But chemically speaking, there is a quality difference pricier bourbon vs cheap bourbon... otherwise they'd all be the same price"
8336,E,N,T,P,"I agree... except for me and makers mark private select bottles... which I guess technically may not count cuz theyre ""finished"""
8337,E,N,T,P,Thats the only reason a JD product is on my shelf. Their single barrel products finally gave me something to relate to with my JD loving friends
8338,E,N,T,P,"^ I'm with this guy. When I say if it was $10 cheaper I'd buy it, it means that there is something at the same price point i would much rather buy. Has nothing to do with the fact that i can't afford it. Theres just stuff at the same price id drink instead."
8339,E,N,T,P,... you absolutely can. Capitalism in its purest form is just trade. I give you something because you have something I want. And each person places gives the product they want its value. There doesn't need to be a government in place for that.
8340,E,N,T,P,They're tied for my favorite burgers in the city for sure. But the lagers are unmatched. The Belgian-styles and stouts are fantastic as well. Minimal gimmicks too.
8341,E,N,T,P,"Burgh'ers Nubbel. Burgh'ers easily makes the best lagers in the city. The head brewer is super passionate about perfecting traditional styles and malty beers. He does a damn fine job with all of them too. My personal favorites are the Helles, kolsch, and his Czech dark lager. Also has a killer oatmeal stout."
8342,E,N,T,P,"The issue with ultra hopped ipas are theyre usually better the fresher they are, so definitely a supply vs demand thing, as well as the fact that the hops for super dry hopped beers are expensive as fuck to make. Brewing hazy ipas can be almost twice as much to produce as an amber ale or brown ale or other low hopped beer. Same reason sours are super expensive. All the fresh fruit/puree necessary for the beer essentially doubles the production cost. Grain and yeast and centuries old hops are cheap. Fruit and new hop strains are not."

8346,E,N,T,P,"Diving down the rabbit hole of reputable sources makes me question my type every day. At least the memes reaffirm my thoughts about it to some degree. Then I just give up and think about more important shit cuz its not like mbti is technically real anyway. Then i realize none of it matters anyways, ima just go out and do some BJJ and then drink. Then I remember covid is a bitch, and can't go out for much. And then i realize I just wasted 3 hours sitting on my couch without accomplishing anything thinking about all of this."
8347,E,N,T,P,"You'd probably save money just splitting the total sand in half, bleaching it, and then dying each half the different color again. Or however many colors you want. Idk. Not sure why you mixed it in the first place if you just wanted to separate it."
8348,E,N,T,P,"Don't skip the cardio. Bike/run/kickbox till it hurts. The sweet, sweet endorphins after heavy cardio helped me tremendously. Runners high is a real thing and actually grants some peace"
8349,E,N,T,P,"I communicate way better in person, its far easier for me to use inflection and body language to get a point across. Miscommunication is far less likely from either party, and i don't feel like im scraping together a conversation because things can just naturally flow in person. Nobody really cares if things are grammatically correct or if your entire point is made in one message. Nothing feels natural in text. Thats why i mostly use it as a means to meet with someone in person instead of holding convos"

8366,E,N,T,P,"At this point, a) how are we defining introverted is the question, and b) using 16 personality types to accurately characterize 7 billion people isn't very accurate.

8374,E,N,T,P,"I've been bouncing around multiple times between cleaning my car, cleaning my room, rebudgeting my paycheck, applying for jobs, watching martial art technique videos and making beer recipes. I only woke up two hours ago. Why am I like this when im depressed."
8375,E,N,T,P,"So when shit is normal, I do muay thai, BJJ, and MMA. I did tae Kwon do for several years until I realized that by itself, its not very applicable. And then on campus I was in the MMA club, I was the vice president of my fraternity, heavily involved in the craft brewing curriculum and going out to different breweries every weekend to try new stuff. I actually had a part time job as an assistant brewer at one of them for 2 years (I'm from Pittsburgh, so we have like 50 something breweries around the county at this point). I also was a member of a church on campus. I bounced around a couple throughout the years. And then i was a commuter student, so I balanced all my shit around those aspects of my life. Plus I was involved in engineering school extracurriculars in general too.

In regards to hiking, id look into smaller ones in general and possibly integrate one maybe once every other week on a Saturday or maybe once a month. Idk, you'd have to finagle around your schedule. I mean i lived in a city, but there was definitely hiking trails maybe a 1 or 2 our drive away from campus for me. So it could work!

Rn I work a lab position as a technologist and and an experimental/pilot plant operator. Basically entry level chemE shit with opportunity to progress. I train daily, but with my gym closed rn I do private BJJ training with my instructor a couple times a week and striking with one of my teammates a couple times a week. I still tour restaurants and breweries, at least the ones that are open. I dont see anybody at risk at all so I'm not too worried about catching corona with my current health. Im involved with the brewery I work at by helping brew or can and giving out ideas and feedback on the next recipes and projects. Ill be working events again once they start back up. Once I settle down more and go out less I'm definitely investing in homebrew equipment to make a ton of the stuff i want to try. Im still just so high energy and outgoing with MMA, being a foodie, having game nights, mountain biking that I dont have time yet to settle in and homebrew. All my martial arts and analyzing beer and bourbon I try and making potential future recipes is enough creative stimulation for me. Thankfully 😂"
8376,E,N,T,P,"Honestly. Idk if my strategy could apply with COVID policies rn. I drank and went out every weekend, plus the occasional Thursday if my fridays were looking slow. It was my reward for getting my shit done during the week. And I procrastinated by doing my easier or more interesting studying first. That way I still had the procrastination sensation but did the work I like better. Idk, I've always been one to wanna do the stuff I hate doing last, cuz once I'm done with the stuff I dont like I don't wanna work at all on school at that point.

Also, I like to live by the big 3 time focuses. 1. Your major classes (money maker), 2. A hobby that keeps you in shape, and 3 a hobby youre passionate about.
My in shape hobby was martial arts. When I got bored with striking id move on to wrestling. When I got bored with wrestling then I'd do jiu jitsu and it just became a cycle. Mountain biking and bmx are pretty cool too. But definitely exercise. It does wonders for your mental health. And my passionate hobby was craft beer. Between an engineering class on craft brewing and having the largest craft beer distributor in my city on campus, I was able to blend day drinking with the boys and a passion for beer making. To this day, i still train martial arts daily, and still have an obsession with craft beer and brewing. 

The key is staying sane and balancing fun and work. And engineering definitely forces self discipline a bit, so push yourself to develop it. You can only go with the flow so much before it starts to flow too fast. Thats how I decided to procrastinate work with other work. Don't overdo it on clubs. I had too many interests at first and that became my downfall for senior year cuz a bunch of groups wanted me in leadership... and i said yes to one too many"

8412,I,N,F,J,How's it going? 20M over here
8413,I,N,F,J,Hey. How are you?
8414,I,N,F,J,How old are you?
8415,I,N,F,J,Censoring a stick figure...
8416,I,N,F,J,Should have gotten out the robot arm
8417,I,N,F,J,"Hey. I'm 20M, if you want to chat"
8418,I,N,F,J,Hey. I like to read and I write a bit too. Wanna chat?
8419,I,N,F,J,"Tbh, sex doesn't *look* that great"
8420,I,N,F,J,Same boat
8421,I,N,F,J,I forget what reality I'm occupying sometimes
8422,I,N,F,J,How did I forget?
8423,I,N,F,J,"It never came up. He even went on that magic carpet ride with them, though he inspired that one"
8424,I,N,F,J,He always took theirs out
8425,I,N,F,J,Second season for more Doof. Perry shows up a few times too. But the thing is really good on its own. Shame I've not heard of more of it coming
8426,I,N,F,J,"Yeah, right"
8427,I,N,F,J,"Man-hungry koalas. Don't go to Australia.

But just an urban legend, really.

Then again, I've never been to Australia..."
8428,I,N,F,J,"Ha, no way. I was just quoting the overlord"
8429,I,N,F,J,I really need to finish this jingle
8430,I,N,F,J,Came for this
8431,I,N,F,P,Irl maze
8432,I,N,F,P,Yeaah
8433,I,N,F,P,"Yeah, i was looking for this comment. I bet it take more than two minutes to solve this"
8434,I,N,F,P,By shooting and slow bleeding on the sidewalk in winter. Thank you
8435,I,N,F,P,Možná jsem Late to the party... Ale za co má ban?
8436,I,N,F,P,Za co?
8437,I,N,F,P,Prove it
8438,I,N,F,P,"Yeah, I'm thinking a lot about a title for my gravestone lately"
8439,I,N,F,P,...but at what cost
8440,I,N,F,P,For me it's certainly Serbian movie... It really left a scar on my mind
8441,I,N,F,P,Corona ASAP
8442,I,N,F,P,Exactly
8443,I,N,F,P,"Ten týpek co to tam dal: ""No need to thank me.."""
8444,I,N,F,P,Nice
8445,I,N,F,P,"I also hate post that start like this.."" You! Yeah.. you! Listen to me..."" And blah blah"
8446,I,N,F,P,F
8447,I,N,F,P,Ve výsledku Vlček potřeboval jen psychologa 😄
8448,I,N,F,P,"Louder, son!!"
8449,I,N,F,P,I'm a girl and this is true
8450,I,N,F,P,*and then feel guilty about it*
8451,I,N,F,P,Fp?
8452,I,N,F,P,Yes
8453,I,N,F,P,Yes
8454,I,N,F,P,"""Unless..."""
8455,I,N,F,P,How do you use it?
8456,I,N,F,P,Was everything a joke?
8457,I,N,F,P,And that's the fact
8458,I,N,F,P,Kromě těch hrubek je to good meme
8459,I,N,F,P,We will watch your career with great interest
8460,I,N,F,P,Když to přeložíš 🤷🏼‍♀️
8461,I,N,F,P,r/hmm
8462,I,N,F,P,"-What about your suicidal thoughts?
-Yeah, it's not that bad. But if i had a chance to get killed I wouldn't think twice"
8463,I,N,F,P,"Yeah, it do be like that"
8464,I,N,F,P,Stejně tak Dáme jídlo!!!! Fuurt dokola
8465,I,N,F,P,I don't see the point in seeing each other anymore. We don't even talk each other through the phones. She barely ask how am I
8466,I,N,F,P,Would it be same for a body? for example.   Asking for a friend
8467,I,N,F,P,Smarter every day :D
8468,I,N,F,P,"I'm tryin, okey"
8469,I,N,F,P,"I am a girl and have similar feeling.
I was used to on continuous texting but with a guy I'm dating rn it's not that often. I'm afraid that I say something wrong or won't catch his attention with my texts. So I'd rather not write anything. And think twice to write something."
8470,I,N,F,P,At least this one scene
8471,I,N,F,P,I know this reference and I like it
8472,I,N,F,P,My year's schendule
8473,I,N,F,P,Thank you I hate it anyway
8474,I,N,F,P,apes together strong
8475,I,N,F,P,What... Where do I get family like this
8476,I,N,F,P,Lmao
8477,I,N,F,P,Thank you
8478,I,N,F,P,"You're a good man, thank you."
8479,I,N,F,P,I work as pizza delivery. It's only part-time job but it's really fun.
8480,I,N,F,P,Thank you
8481,E,N,T,P,"Huh, I did the same and was not aware of them being inferior to Quad cores. My 9 year old build is about ready to be retired. Would I have been better off with a Quad Core?"
8482,E,N,T,P,All 3 of them can all go to hell
8483,E,N,T,P,That's odd. I had a Walmart Card and a Kay's credit card that I just used to buy a TV and an engagement ring and they closed the accounts about 12 months after I paid them off
8484,E,N,T,P,"Um yeah. It is. I think we're in agreement on that.

And I'm not sure where your getting the idea that I'm upset. I was just trying to input my 2 cents"
8485,E,N,T,P,I don't know. There's a lot of time in 15 years. I feel like if you play just about every day for 15 years you could do it.
8486,E,N,T,P,You still gotta either be a loser in your mom's basement or a pro gamer or streamer. Who else would have the time to get that many achievements?
8487,E,N,T,P,Pretty sure you just hit the nail on the head
8488,E,N,T,P,Just pretend that's a shadow
8489,E,N,T,P,Gotcha. I've always bought RAM in pairs so I guess I was doing it right
8490,E,N,T,P,What's the advantage in that?
8491,E,N,T,P,There is. You get banned from matchmaking
8492,E,N,T,P,I would completely disagree. In those types of countries they may realize there is nothing they can do about it due to things likes rigged elections or no elections at all. It doesn't mean they accept it.
8493,E,N,T,P,Like 70-75% story wise. Prob only about 40% in terms of entire game content
8494,E,N,T,P,I don't feel like your question makes any sense. So because it already happens people should just be okay with it?
8495,E,N,T,P,Are these actually worth something? I have a ton of these
8496,E,N,T,P,"5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 3, 2, 1, 8

Yeah, not a big fan of Jedi apparently as every one else is. 7 I felt was underrated and 8 was just a complete disaster."
8497,E,N,T,P,"I only find it rude when it is still not clear who the winner is but someone says ""good game"" just because they think they are so far ahead. Nothing makes me happier than winning after someone says good game in those situations."
8498,E,N,T,P,"You call a plumber whenever your toilet clogs? Yeah, you probably should stick to renting."
8499,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, and what was annoying about Homeplate is that you can't even make a supply line to it. So you had to individually bring items there to craft stuff for your home."
8500,E,N,T,P,"I like settlements but I would've prefer less settlements, but make them bigger and have more options. On my first game, I made the mistake of opening up all the settlements as early as I could without really building up their defense, food, shops, etc. Then I'd get notifications every 15 minutes or so, saying this settlement is under attack. I started a second game and am only opening up one settlement at a time and putting work into it before opening another one."
8501,E,N,T,P,"You can also activate it at the end of your opponents turn, then you have all of your mana and 8 fresh new cards available for that turn"
8502,E,N,T,P,"Affinity decks before clamp were actually pretty fun and fair. It was mono blue Broodstar affinity with some counters and thoughtcast for card draw. Then Ravager, Aether Vial and Skullclamp came along and screwed everything up so clamp was banned. Then they go and ruin every thing again by printing Cranial Plating in Fifth Dawn. That was when they banned the lands, Ravager, and Disciple."
8503,E,N,T,P,Or stop using sponges. They're gross. Just use dish towels and then wash them each time.
8504,E,N,T,P,I knew I forgot about something. I wanted to add that you shouldn't read any books that give you extra skill points until you get the perk that doubles their effectiveness. I think you can get it at lvl 4
8505,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, I'm talking about leveling to 30. You can still get them pretty high at 20 though. You also have to max out intelligence pretty early as well."
8506,E,N,T,P,"Unlike fo4, you get a limited number of perks and the max level is 30 if you have the broken steel dlc. So this makes some of the perks kinda worthless especially any perk that increases experience. You will get plenty of XP throughout the game and will easily max out before finishing all the missions.

Difficulty level effects xp earned so if you play on very hard, you will max out you level much faster.

You will easily get enough skill points to max them out by endgame so perks that increase these are generally worthless.

The perk that increases your special ratings can be used multiple times. Just don't increase a stat past 9 unless you have the bobblehead for it. I don't believe any of the special stats will go past 10.

Intelligence is very useful for increasing skills faster. The bobblehead is in Rivet City so try to get there early in the game before gaining too many levels."
8507,E,N,T,P,You're absolutely right. Look at George W's approval rating after 9/11. All he had to do was say we're going after the terrorists and his re-election was in the bag.
8508,E,N,T,P,"You're looking for r/Libertarian. Outside the US, Portugal has legalized drugs and it has been very successful to curb drug addiction."
8509,E,N,T,P,Because people like the legislate morality for some weird reason
8510,E,N,T,P,Exactly. That would be a much safer business if it was legal as well
8511,E,N,T,P,"Heroin has been a problem exactly because it's illegal. If people had a safe, legal way to obtain opiates, people wouldn't be buying sketchy products from sketchy drug dealers. Keeping it illegal causes the black market to flourish, leading to unsafe ingredients and dosages."
8512,E,N,T,P,I've still got a PC I built in 2011. It's got an RX 580 in it. You're PC is fine
8513,E,N,T,P,White supremacists trying to stir up racial tensions
8514,E,N,T,P,I like presidents who don't get Covid
8515,E,N,T,P,"Wow, dude. Homophobia went out of fashion like 20 years ago. Try not being a piece of shit in the future."
8516,E,N,T,P,I remember when a lot of our fans were bitching because we didn't promote Gase to Head coach after his 2014 season and we got Kubiak instead. As if Gase had any input into Peyton's playcalling. It makes me feel better knowing I was right about Gase. He's an awful coach who lucked into having Peyton Manning for a QB to cover for him.
8517,E,N,T,P,I wouldn't want to wish harm on any one but.....Karma gets you eventually
8518,E,N,T,P,"At first I didn't get it and I was thinking ""Dark Souls II isn't THAT old you guys."""
8519,E,N,T,P,Obviously they are. Advanced AI is the future of humanity. It's inevitable.
8520,E,N,T,P,Is that an Azusa playmat? That's a good idea to use a playmat for m & k. Never thought of that.
8521,E,N,T,P,I tried to post this article in r/Conservative and it got auto-moderated. Those people clearly like to have their heads in the sand.
8522,E,N,T,P,"I can't stand posts like this. ""I'm making half a million dollars a year. How are my finances doing?"" Screw you, dude."
8523,E,N,T,P,"NTA. Your inlaws sound like asshats. Coming from an American, don't come here right now. There is a good reason we are the laughing stock of the world right now."
8524,E,N,T,P,"8k, higher framerates, better VR performance, faster response time, faster load times; there are always ways to make a console more powerful"
8525,E,N,T,P,I can't believe they thought Lotus Cobra would be a good idea to add to standard. Especially with Fabled Passage in the format. As if ramp wasn't good enough already.
8526,E,N,T,P,Telltale games as well

8536,E,N,T,P,You’re an incel
8537,E,N,T,P,You’re an incel
8538,E,N,T,P,Okie dokie
8539,E,N,T,P,They always seem to want to satiate a desire to connect with others but in a different way than most people. They want a profound understanding of someone and for that person to have a profound understanding of them. But they want it private and quiet and almost like it doesn’t exist. Like in a small world. Like a dream
8540,E,N,T,P,Wow. That’s a really cool boat
8541,E,N,T,P,I read that as monkey at first. I was confused
8542,E,N,T,P,Are you gonna do male or female first for ENTP? I’ve never seen a female ENTP art yet on mbti
8543,E,N,T,P,It’s appropriate the NTs are last. We get damn near everything on r/mbti (I am ENTP. Not a hater)
8544,E,N,T,P,I don’t know. INTJs are always going on about some poetic stuff
8545,E,N,T,P,Grey rock
8546,E,N,T,P,I spent hours on it. Smoke up. Sit there for hours

8549,E,N,T,P,And I was agreeing with you lol
8550,E,N,T,P,It’s the incel. Fascist11. ISTJ super human. Sexist and racist and misogynistic incel.
8551,E,N,T,P,It’s the incel again
8552,E,N,T,P,My wife is cheering you on and feeling your rage.
8553,E,N,T,P,My wife is ISFJ and we’ve been together for like 4 and half years
8554,E,N,T,P,I love that I don’t need to wear my glasses and I’m not stuck in the same position hurting my neck looking at the tv. I have my Switch Lite on a mount attached to my Pro Controller. I’ve been playing Overwatch a lot more than I have in a long time
8555,E,N,T,P,What is the dawn and anal beads for?... ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
8556,E,N,T,P,"I see that if you go over 4, you might as well have 7 or more."
8557,E,N,T,P,"I have two friends. I text one. Never seen them before. I call the other only when we’re both working. See him on the road occasionally when we grab orders from the same place. Never planned a hang out before. Besides that, I have my wife and son. I’m 28. But even when I was younger and single, I kept no more than 4 friends. Usually about 3."
8558,E,N,T,P,Right?? I’m trying to get the lootboxes for vengeful ghost and the fast omnic one still. I have everything else for this week. I have 950 currency on Switch. I want the tengu skin for Genji and possibly cultist for Zen if I can. I have 1500 on PS4 and want the same skins this month. So I have my work cut out for me
8559,E,N,T,P,I’ve always been 1-3. But was never much for hanging out in person. Except a few years where I had a clubbing phase
8560,E,N,T,P,Not quite yet lol I just started on Switch a few days ago. I’ll leveling up to start playing comp.
8561,E,N,T,P,It’s not as bad as I thought it was gonna be. I play on PS4. Just got a pro controller and have been wanting to buy OW on Switch for a while. I’ll be buying it when the trial ends
8562,E,N,T,P,Best dad ever
8563,E,N,T,P,"Someone you talk to when you’re not forced to be around them. If you only talk to them in the class you share or at your job, but not outside of those areas, personally, I don’t define that as a friend. But I guess it’s up to the definition of each person that votes."
8564,E,N,T,P,Well 100% of everything you say is incel things. Like I said. Why not take this to r/mgtow2 where you’ll get upvotes
8565,E,N,T,P,The incel has returned
8566,E,N,T,P,"Thank you so much for looking in to me so in depth. I really appreciate it and it gives me more food for thought. Actually, some months ago, I had thought INTJ. The tests normally type me INTP. And in regard to how I speak verbally, I’m quite obnoxious and scattered. I think I just have a good respect for written communication. I have a post on my account somewhat explain the day when I eureka’d the likelihood of being ENTP"
8567,E,N,T,P,Everyone is commenting about neck and back pain. I sleep bent backwards. No one else enjoys bending this way?
8568,E,N,T,P,You’re a good pooch
8569,E,N,T,P,"I think it would take a lot more effort to maintain imaginary friends than real ones, so sure."
8570,E,N,T,P,"Definitely dependent on each person’s definition. I never considered classmates or coworkers my friends. A friend would be someone I go out of my way to talk to. I have spoken to plenty of people out of convenience, but once that convenience stops (like being in the same class or job) the talking stops, so I wouldn’t consider that a friend. I guess I should have had each vote encompass more numbers"
8571,E,N,T,P,Love for you 💕
8572,E,N,T,P,And hate ENTPs lol
8573,E,N,T,P,"When I was a supervisor, I made checklists for everyone so they wouldn’t forget anything and trained everyone well. My goal was to lay everything down so that if I wasn’t there, everything would still run smoothly."
8574,E,N,T,P,Of course :) We all love our pets!
8575,E,N,T,P,"Always happens lol Someone fed their chihuahua pizza and I said that was awful and people got butthurt. But this towel method is nothing like that. Very helpful with nail trimming, too. But when you roll it, it has a habit of getting tighter with every 360. So start loose and stick you fingers in their to make sure there’s space :)"
8576,E,N,T,P,It’s a tengu. Just like Hanzo’s. Japanese mythology. Protective spirits or bad demons depending on what time in history it was.
8577,E,N,T,P,Brilliant
8578,E,N,T,P,"You could try air duster on joystick. Push in the joystick. Blow. Move around. Put very small amount like a q-tip of rubbing alcohol on it all over while off. Blow. Move it around.

8581,I,N,F,J,"Honestly, at this point it's a symptom of a bigger problem. One that's been prevalent for several decades now, but social media continues to fan the flames, making the issue increasingly insidious.

Generations of women (and men to a certain extent) have been covertly indoctrinated by marketing with the intention to create insecurity. Your grandmother and great-grandmother were told they were too thin, too tan, hair is too dark, too curly, and so on. Every generation, the message changes but the intent of the message is the same; ""You're flawed. Not good enough. Lesser than.""

Your mother was told she's too fat, too curvy, not tall enough, breasts aren't big enough, not tan enough, not enough make-up, and so on. Market trends show that people respond to having their assumed attractiveness belittled and criticized by buying plastic surgery.

This generation is taught they're too plain, not enough make-up, breasts too small, ass too small, body is too square, hips too narrow, waist too big, not pretty enough, teeth not straight enough and not white enough, too fat, too thin, and so on. Different message, same intent. 

She is the manifestation of predatory marketing, taking advantage of people's drive to achieve a perceived social standing through assumed attractiveness."
8582,I,N,F,J,Did it spread dog poop all over your floors?
8583,I,N,F,J,"Welp, just found the new weight loss fad of 2021; pine needle diet & resin tea."
8584,I,N,F,J,"It's fascinating to see this dynamic play out with the original commenter. She's happy with the arrangement where the spouse doesn't offer much physical work, but puts in more effort in psychological, emotional and intellectual needs. You don't often see this kind of support from men, but if OP has a man that's actually in-tune with her mentally and emotionally on top of intellect, I kind of want to see how that works out. I wish OP didn't shut down after being questioned because her situation is very interesting.

Coincidentally, I also once had a connection with a guy that had a hard time keeping employment and was unmotivated overall, but his psychological support was the best I've ever experienced. Tbh, I still adore him until this day, and it's been over a decade since we last spoke."
8585,I,N,F,J,"Bingo, the risk is waaaaaay too great. I feel for all women who are going through this, but good god I could never put my financial safety in the hands of a spouse."
8586,I,N,F,J,"But why did that first red car pull out and just stop in the middle of the road? Nothing was in front of it from this angle, certainly not any traffic in front of him"
8587,I,N,F,J,"Ah, gotcha. Yeah I can see that."
8588,I,N,F,J,"What part of my comment implied that they weren't? Or are you intending to add in the fact that spices are vegan, rather than a correction?"

8592,I,N,F,J,That sounds like a yummy snack. I should do the same.
8593,I,N,F,J,"I don't like peanuts, OP. I mean I can deal when they're buried in **thiccc** chocolate and/or coated in caramel, but the thin layer of chocolate in m&ms just isn't enough to mask the gross flavor of those peanuts. When I was a kid, I'd suck the chocolate off of the peanut then spit it out"

8596,I,N,F,J,"I'm looking forward to some falafel myself. First time I tried falafel was in their omelet years ago. Guy at the counter asked me ""have you ever tried falafel before?"", and I said yes so he wouldn't try to talk me out of it. It was delicious"
8597,I,N,F,J,"Google carrot lox my friend. Basically you buy a metric fuckton of flakey salt, put some fat carrots in it to cure it, bake it, and then brine the carrots in a fish-flavored sauce. I used fish sauce, a little soy, nori sheet cut into pieces and some brown flaxseed meal to make mine taste like the ocean. Brine for 2-3 days and the end result is yummy silky carrot lox"
8598,I,N,F,J,"Veggies aren't bland though. Maybe if you don't know how to cook and season your food, but there's so much more to flavor than just animal fat and salt. Veggies are abundantly flavorful."
8599,I,N,F,J,"Hilarious. Vegan foods are great, but it's really hard to mimic certain types of meat. Chicken can be done easily, salmon is doable with some effort, breakfast sausage patties are pretty easy, but something like burger patties or chops or steak isn't gonna happen. Veggie patties are yummy in their own way, and so are veggie steaks. 

You can't really faux your way into recreating animal fat, but you can get plenty of flavor from veg protein and spices."

8601,I,N,F,J,"I find that so incredibly hard to believe. I have no idea what qanon is nor where to find ""it"", and I just cannot wrap my mind around a whole collection of people believing utter nonsense. 100% fictional garbage, and consuming it as proven fact. I can't accept it."

Ovvero, credo che ciascuno di noi abbia un destino, ossia un futuro determinato dalla nostra genetica e dalle nostre esperienze ambientali, un percorso che lo porta su una strada specifica, che è quella e quella soltanto.
Conoscere le proprie tendenze, anche quelle meno consce rendendole consapevoli, non significa avere in mano le chiavi del nostro destino; se per destino s'intende ciò che succederà nella nostra vita. Infatti, indipendentemente da ciò che noi _vogliamo_ o _progettiamo_ , il corso delle cose sarà uno e unico, quasi totalmente imprevedibile, ed inoltre pur facendo delle scelte (e delle scelte consapevoli), sono convinto che tali scelte non siano libere, bensì condizionate dall'ambiente circostante (cultura di riferimento) e dalla nostra storia ontologica (genetica e temperamento).

8668,I,N,T,J,"Esatto. Credo che appunto tentando di conoscere se stessi (al massimo grado consentito dalla vita frenetica a cui siamo costretti), le persone possano ""puntare il dito"" un po' meno sugli altri e più su se stessi, smettendo di proiettare le proprie insicurezze, fragilità e oscurità personali sugli altri."

8740,E,N,F,P,"Yes!! I was so pissed when I found out that other countries just prescribe that after childbirth, but we’re in the US where no one cares about women (still salty about it). My doctor’s office had never even heard of it so I schooled them. My NP (not the OB that stitched me too high and wouldn’t listen to me) kept telling me during my annual that my lady parts didn’t even feel like I had given birth! That they were totally back to pre-baby (which they apparently never see). I was just like “yeah, the more you know...” 

Oh, and screw all the Kegel people. I did Kegels all the time. My problem was that my body didn’t know how to release so I was too tight and couldn’t pee. No one tells you that you have to release and relax for the same amount of time that you tighten! It took a month of therapy, but they totally fixed me!"
8741,E,N,F,P,"This was me. First pregnancy was a breeze with hardly any morning sickness. This time around I was sick for almost 6 straight months. My 4 year old didn’t appreciate it either which is why we told her what was happening super early so she knew I wasn’t just ignoring her while passed out on the couch. Gin Gins (ginger chews) worked with my first, but not with this one. I even tried bonjesta (the prescription version of unisons and B6) - didn’t work.

8745,E,N,F,P,"My biggest advice for anyone having a baby or anyone who has had a baby is go to a pelvic floor physiotherapist!!! Don’t be scared. Be empowered that if you need it, there are people that can make everything right again. 

Second degree tear, doctor stitched me too high and had to “fix” me during my 6 week visit. More recovery time after that. Had lots of scar tissue and some postpartum trauma from pushing for 4 hours.  Long story short, I went to a pelvic floor physiotherapist and everything was back to normal in a month. Not everyone has postpartum recovery problems, but some do and need therapy. Also, don’t let your doctor tell you that what you’re experiencing is normal and just “takes time or another baby” (seriously that’s what he fucking said to me). I waited 10 months before I sought help, and it was unnecessary."

8753,E,N,F,P,"I was listening to Pod Save America yesterday with Barack Obama talking about Joe. He starts talking about he and Joe doing rope lines and says “You guys know me, I was always good at working a rope line. I love kissing babies and grandmas. I’d get through the rope line and look back and Joe would still only be ⅓ of the way through! He was talking to people and telling stories. That’s who Joe is. That’s who he’s always been.”

That really came through during the Town Hall. It was exactly as Obama described. He was genuine and truly wanted to get to heart of the issues with the people asking the questions. He wanted them to feel satisfied. That shows integrity."

8755,E,N,F,P,"This is my second pregnancy, and I have felt this way from the beginning. My first pregnancy was so easy: hardly any sickness or nausea, I felt comfortable in my body, every time I felt her move was something I treasured, and I was excited the entire time! 

This time around.... I was sick for 6 straight months, the exhaustion is so awful (especially now that I have a 4 year old), this baby is so low and loves to kick me straight in the cervix, I have gestational diabetes, I got kidney stones, my lower body in particular has gotten huge, and I can just look at food and get heartburn. I’m 33 weeks and beyond ready for this to be over. 

I feel kinda guilty because I’ve been saying to my husband from the very beginning of this that we are NEVER having another baby because I am so miserable, and I know he feels guilty/must be getting really tired of it. He’s started looking at me randomly and just saying “thank you for doing this for us.” 

My point is, not everything is a moment to be treasured, and that’s okay. Pregnancy is so short compared to the lifetime of raising your baby."

Grannies - for obvious reasons 😂

Camping- I cry every time at the end when the tree grows and Bluey is reunited with Jean Luc. 

Sleepytime- This one is so so special to me. It’s like watching a night in our house on screen. I cry every single time Chili snuggles Bingo and says “I’ll always be here for you even if you can’t see me because I love you.” I cannot count the times I’ve said that to my own daughter since she was a small baby.

8763,E,N,F,P,Thank you so much for this!
8764,E,N,F,P,Yes. No idea what’s going on...
8765,E,N,F,P,FLY IN PENCE’s HAIR!!!
8766,E,N,F,P,"Same! I was unmedicated with my first from the moment I found out I was pregnant until she was fully weaned from breastfeeding. I absolutely cannot imagine doing that with 2. No. Fucking. Way. The way I put it to my midwife was “I’d really like to breastfeed for as long as possible, but that is only going to be possible if I’m able to be medicated in some way.” My neurologist hasn’t been much help in this department either. He knows what works for narcolepsy, but not how it effects the baby and was hesitant to prescribe anything."
8767,E,N,F,P,"I’m currently working with my neurologist and midwives. They are comfortable with me taking either Adderall or Ritalin while breastfeeding as both have been found to be safe with trace amounts in breast milk. I’ve never taken either medication as I have only ever been on Modafinil and Armodafinil previously, so I have no idea which one is going to be most effective. 
Going to talk with my midwife next week about it, and I have an appointment in November to finalize the decision with my neurologist."
8768,E,N,F,P,"As someone currently on my second pregnancy with Narcolepsy I can tell you that Narcolepsy isn’t going to ruin being a mother, especially since you have a doctor that is willing medicate you during your pregnancy! I’m currently un-medicated, 8 months pregnant and with a 4 year old and trying to come up with a plan for medicated breastfeeding. You can do this! 

I’m sorry you’re feeling sad about your diagnosis, but hopefully that will turn into relief once you find a medication that works best for you. For me, getting my diagnosis and medication allowed me to finally see what I had been missing all these years. It was like I was finally awake for the first time in my adult life. The relief I felt was palpable. I hope you get that same relief"
8769,E,N,F,P,"This was my immediate first thought as well. Trump is getting even more desperate than I ever could have imagined. This is despicable, even for him."
8770,E,N,F,P,That’s not how science works and also not how vaccines work. And also not how drugs that are currently under clinical trials work.
8771,E,N,F,P,"My husband is currently in the Moderna vaccine trial. He just got his first shot 2 weeks ago. It’s in Phase 3, and he will be observed for 2 full years. The drug companies are doing everything right. This clown just wants to pull a Putin and push anything he can through because he thinks it’ll help his re-election chances. Fuck Trump."
8772,E,N,F,P, Very well stated. I think this is exactly who the undecided voter is.
8773,E,N,F,P,"I love the name Harrison, but my last name is Ball. Can’t have a kid named Harry Ball 😂
Same with Milo. It ended up on our list and my best friend pointed out that we cannot name our kid Milo Ball."
8774,E,N,F,P,"This is also textbook behavior of abusers, dictators, narcissists, and cult leaders. Trump has been doing this for so long that it’s his nature, and it was probably done to him as a child. The goal is the gain more power by making the victim question reality.

8775,E,N,F,P,"Not in the US, but in other countries that is the norm."
8776,E,N,F,P,You mean like all the Americans that aren’t Native Americans?
8777,E,N,F,P,"Just an FYI, your baby can’t form negative sleep associations until AFTER their growth spurt around 3.5-4.5 months of age where their brain transitions from newborn sleep cycles to adult sleep cycles. Some kids breeze through this, some do not. Don’t judge your friends until you’ve been there."
8778,E,N,F,P,"Admittedly I’m not on FB a lot these days, but I’m friends with my child’s nurse on FB and the labor and delivery nurse from the hospital where I gave birth and my gynecologist who I’ve been seeing for 15 years. I live in a small town."
8779,E,N,F,P,"Mom of a 4 year old chiming in. My husband and I both agreed about a month or so ago that we didn’t really have terrible 2’s but we were totally making up for it now. 

She goes through a brain growth spurt about every other month or so, and it is unbearable.... tantrums, screaming, hitting, and sooooo much back talk... It helps a little that we know what’s happening so we can help her through it, but man some days are just so hard. 

One thing that really helped us through the baby and toddler years was the app The Wonder Weeks. It tells you when your LO is going through a mental growth spurt, what they are learning, and how to help them through it. We all know about physical growth spurts, but the mental ones are tricky. This app was a total lifesaver for us even though it only goes to about 24 months. We still use the same principles to this day, and it really helps us understand our kiddo."
8780,E,N,F,P,A friend just attended a funeral for his 21 year old friend who died of COVID last week. No preexisting conditions. Her brain swelling was just too much for her body to handle. Stop thinking this isn’t a big fucking deal.
8781,I,N,F,P,This is so beautiful!
8782,I,N,F,P,Not my proudest fap.
8783,I,N,F,P,This is really beautiful and inspiring! Thank you! I guess it's just a matter of communicating openly.
8784,I,N,F,P,"So the fallacy in this argument is that ""age is just a number"" . Age is NOT just a number. For example, age can determine whether or not you can CONCENT."
8785,I,N,F,P,This is trully amazing!
8786,I,N,F,P,I just wanna check whether I have anger issues or not. Would it have been ethical to roundhouse-kick her?
8787,I,N,F,P,"Would you be interested in talking about spirituality with an atheist (M17)? Perhaps curious to see the other side of the sperctrum? I, at least, am curious to see your thoughts."
8788,I,N,F,P,"So, just a list with my favorite bands and/or genres? I'm not familiar with sharing taste.
I'd be interested tho."
8789,I,N,F,P,"(M17) Idk why, but I feel like this has potential to be decent. If you're not already overwhelmed with dm's, would you give us a try?"

8794,I,N,F,P,"I mean, bayblade."
8795,I,N,F,P,*I* like it.
8796,I,N,F,P,You can't take any more steps.
8797,I,N,F,P,"You know that they are different people, right? The onlyfans women don't care to be seen as independent and strong and the independent and strong women don't like being seen as sexual. I doubt there's any significant amount of women that are in both camps."
8798,I,N,F,P,Nice! Thanks!

8801,I,N,F,P,Masturbation addiction.
8802,I,N,F,P,"If the bullying is physical (at school, for example), speak to an authority (or become a martial arts God). If it takes place online, report the comment, message and/or the user. Regardless, know that there is nothing wrong with you. but with the bully."
8803,I,N,F,P,"Liking an artist's music and liking the artist's personality or behavior are not the same thing.

If someone makes good music (which is, of course, subjective), the product deserves to be bought. If someone has sex with a 13 year old, they deserve punishment by the law and additional hate from society. I don't see the link between the two."
8804,I,N,F,P,I guess that's just how people are. Insecure but assertive people bully the (at least seemingly) weak ones.

I'm somewhat geeky but it is because I'm interested in technology as a whole.
I'm intrigued by what were as a species capable of doing in the future.
I once watched a 30 minute video on how the universe is going to end and how it will be basically pitch black for eternity when the last Star dies. And I actually cried by the end of the video. Here's the link https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQA

9003,E,S,T,P,"Can't say exactly why as I'm new to MBTI but I'm not getting ESTP vibes from you. We usually don't worry much about the future, we can be bossy at times but not always, and we generally don't take life too seriously. Some of us were shy when young but I bet most weren't.

As I said, don't take my comment too seriously because I know nothing about anything."
9004,E,S,T,P,This has meme potential

9011,E,S,T,P,"Got married at 25, been married for 10 years."
9012,E,S,T,P,"Your role in life while young is to explore it, you don't have to know how it all works.

Go out, have fun, build relationships, throw parties, explore places.

Being young is priceless, don't care too much about the future ( I know you don't anyways).


But most importantly, you matter, you fit in this world, the world needs you, yes you will fall in love and have a spouse later in life. Don't look for validation in the wrong places or with the wrong people.

Don't feel down if people can't figure you out, most people don't get ESTPs, not even us sometimes. They secretly envy your ability to not give a fuck and at the same time win in life.


Also, take your time while deciding which career you will pursue, I know we are adaptable and can perform well in almost everything (except for boring, soulless jobs). Try to choose something dynamic, not sitting in a desk all the time.

I work at IT, and have lots of free time and an open internet connection at the office, so I don't get too bored surfing the web or playing games at the office (I know), but it eats your soul away slowly, I recently got into building things with my hands, welding and carpentry, and it's awesome, I wish I had done it sooner.

I'm 36, married, have a son (5). Life is awesome, and I know it will always be, even if my circumstances changes."

9019,E,S,T,P,'nuff said.
9020,E,S,T,P,between 1 and 2
9021,E,S,T,P,"Kind of unrelated, but when I was at University, I tried to be friends with every friend group in my class, from the nerds to the party boys, I was successful. But as I knew more of these groups of friend I discovered that some operated in this realm of 'feelings' I didn't have access to. They were there for each other and understood what the other was comming tru

This sometimes made me feel a bit off, like there was no one else like me, I think I was the only ESTP in my classes.

But I didn´t think of it very often I was busy being happy and being myself, doing stuff and hanging out with my closest friends.

You are right, delving in the past and thinking about our emotions is not in our nature.

We can not express ourselves in terms of emotions, we are aware of them, but we can't verbally process them.

9080,I,N,T,P,"OK as someone who's ""sex organs"" don't work. Wtf like. So I shouldn't date anyone since I'm PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO HAVE SEX? Like SEX DOESN'T MEAN SHIT IN A RELATIONSHIP"
9081,I,N,T,P,"r/childfree was the very first sub I ever visted I made a comment like ""pro-lifers aren't breeders- wtf am I then"" and BRROO THE DOWNVOTES AND COMMENTS.

9088,I,N,T,P,Well there's the trans ban thing (I know that's just for people with severe dysphoria but still people get on about that) and I've read a few articles about him didn't want sexual orientation covered under no discrimination acts and something about repealing gay marriage I could try to find the articles.
9089,I,N,T,P,Aayyyeee dissociation due to high stress yyyayy 😂
9090,I,N,T,P,True. Which is who I'm assuming this post came from originally
9091,I,N,T,P,They're so woke they're homophobic and transphobic. Trans is a medical condition NOT A PREFERENCE. Butch lesbians/bi women and femme gay/bi men are not the opposite sex! It just makes us happy like wtf.
9092,I,N,T,P,Yea sorry 😂
9093,I,N,T,P,Well the heteromantic side. Even if the attraction to boys vs girls isn't.
9094,I,N,T,P,Oh interesting so it's like even. 🤔
9095,I,N,T,P,And this is why Google will never surpass a medical degree lmao
9096,I,N,T,P,If I have 2 uteri imma be pissed. 😂 Glad you figured it out tho! Hope surgery goes well!
9097,I,N,T,P,Thanks! Definitely will
9098,I,N,T,P,Yea I'm like this is so socially unacceptable what is wrong with me 😂
9099,I,N,T,P,"Sometimes, 👀 when you kill off main characters multiple times lmao"
9100,I,N,T,P,I do that too with real or imagined situations idk if that's the best thing to do but I always right the wrong in my head 😂
9101,I,N,T,P,OK phew 😂 I was legit scared.
9102,I,N,T,P,Why do men ✨
9103,I,N,T,P,I love being asexual 😂
9104,I,N,T,P,Yea I'm actually pretty social. But the more people there are/if the person is really energetic the more time I'll have to take later to recharge kinda. But that doesn't mean I won't try to interact.
9105,I,N,T,P,That would be like my mom showing little me my dad ass naked sleeping. N O. NO NO NO NO NO. WHY DO THE STRAIGHTS BORDER ON PEDOPHILIC-
9106,I,N,T,P,I would probably cry and hide under the counter. I'm birtomantic but still like the thought of boobies scares me-
9107,I,N,T,P,Oh OK. I got it 👍
9108,I,N,T,P,"Yes I have, and I tell him when new hallucinations occur. So like. These ""paralysis demons"" are like semi normal psychosis but anything outside of falling asleep/waking is ""bad"" psychosis? Sorry I'm being stupid 😂"
9109,I,N,T,P,"Nonbinary aside, if they were trans masc like ftm or something they would not be lesbian- like it's OK to be straight and trans- you don't have to be an LGBT sandwich-"
9110,I,N,T,P,"Ugh no. You're right to ""happiness"" and worry free sex doesn't trump the right to LITERAL LIFE"
9111,I,N,T,P,I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SHOW UNTIL I READ THE COMMENTS 😂
9112,I,N,T,P,I would do them one better. What if the mother wanted to kill that child solely based on disability? Is that not ableist? If the baby were able bodied she wouldn't but since it's not she will. What about that.
9113,I,N,T,P,I would not have left oh my god I'd be like send someone up here so help me god
9114,I,N,T,P,This kept playing when I shut my phone off- now I'm scared 😂
9115,I,N,T,P,"I know this post is kinda old at this point but just in case you're still reading comments. Trauma is extremely difficult to deal with. Especially sexual trauma, as I'm sure others have said. It wasn't your fault. You were already dealing with so much burden, especially having narcissistic parents. Family can be an extremely influential force. You were manipulated and purposely misinformed. I hope you get the help you deserve ❤"
9116,I,N,T,P,Exactly. The bible doesn't even mention anything about trans people
9117,I,N,T,P,I think it would depend on age/occupation/what state they live in. From what I've seen people on the east coast are more curious about Europe while West coast cares more about what Asia's doing. And of course Canada 😂
9118,I,N,T,P,Honestly you're probably not wrong but if you have any questions I could help you out 😂
9119,I,N,T,P,I mean I'm OK with being a cis woman and dislike my body parts as I've seen quite a few people actually claim. But that doesn't mean I think gender and sex are separate...
9120,I,N,T,P,I have spastic diplegia and an over amount of stress or excitement makes me spasm pretty bad.
9121,I,N,T,P,Oh shit! I totally forgot I had accessed these through my college library 😂. Hhmm. I mean I didn't understand shit after reading them anyways lmao. Maybe try searching them from the website I see them on? Gale academic one file: Personality traits of suicidality are associated with Premenstrual syndrome and Premenstrual dysphoric disorder in a Suicidal Women sample. And science direct: anger in women with premenstrual disorder: It's relationship with premenstrual dysphoric disorder and sociodemographic and clinical variables
9122,I,N,T,P,"I know that, it's rather that if I say I don't want to tell them then they're going to automatically assume or put words in my mouth"
9123,I,N,T,P,Well that makes sense if you're on campus. For me I've been at home for months and my campus plans to remain closed through the spring. I hate how the schools are so disjointed like wtf are we doing.
9124,I,N,T,P,So I'm assuming you're not a centrist than
9125,I,N,T,P,"Oh I definitely want to. But with the inability to drive, being a full time student and no control over my bank account I want to work on knowing I can independently take care of myself before I make such a huge leap of living on my own or with a friend."

9177,I,N,T,P,"That sounds amazing 👍I've thought about possibly pursuing psychology in graduate school too...or maybe I'll just study it on the side, who knows. Been doing things outdoors a lot lately and experimenting with photography myself. Regardless, best of luck on your adventures, whether they're the ones you mentioned or otherwise!"
9178,I,N,T,P,"Very true, you can call it a goal, thing to do, wish, activity, trip idea...eventually you're just talking semantics. You're very fortunate with regards to your work situation, my most recent (and first) major solo trip was something akin to the maniac-rushing-around thing at times, and I really realized first hand how that kind of travel is not all that conducive to INTP-ness.

9191,I,N,T,P,"There's no larch hikes off the Mtn Loop, so something off hwy 20 would probably be your best bet since you'll be heading to Bellingham. I think the major larch hikes off there are Maple Pass, Blue Lake, and Cutthroat Lk/pass, but I've read they're pretty popular for larch-seekers so get there early (or late) if the weather's good. The one I did today was Carne Mountain, sorta between Lk Wenatchee and Lk Chelan, and I'd say most of the larches still had a good amount of orange needles on them, but they probably won't last more than another week if the wind and snow keep up. Good luck!"

9212,I,N,T,P,Best thing I've read in a while
9213,I,N,T,P,"Adding this trip to my bucket list, such a great, timeless film!"
9214,I,N,T,P,"That was super informative, thanks for the info! I was skeptical of the idea of just plain bi-wiring since you'd just be sending the same signal from the amp to the ""high"" and ""low"" parts of the speaker, thus the amp doesn't ""know"" it's any different than normal wiring. Would you need some kind of external crossover between the amp and the speaker in order to bi-wire with any tangible benefits?"
9215,I,N,T,P,"Would it be possible to ""bi-amp"" speakers by connecting them to both of a stereo receiver's channels/speaker sets (A and B) using 2 speaker cables each? In other words, is it possible to bi-amp speakers with a stereo receiver that has 2 sets of speaker outputs? If so, would this be more advantageous than just bi-wiring them the normal way with a single set of receiver output terminals? 

Current setup is a Harman Kardon 730 receiver driving 2 Polk Studio Monitor 60 speakers, which have 2 sets of binding posts and the removable bridge thingy for bi-wiring/amping. The 730 is a stereo receiver with 2 speaker channels (speaker A and B) and the speakers are connected to Spkr A in the traditional way at the moment. The 730 has plenty of power to spare and I definitely want to take advantage!"
9216,I,N,T,P,Good old PNW winters ❤⛰🌲
9217,I,N,T,P,"Got offered: trade away Fournette and CeeDee Lamb in exchange for Tyler Boyd and D'Andre Swift? Half PPR. Feel free to explain any reasoning.

9225,I,N,T,P,"I like to think of INTP as being more imaginative (due to Ne) than INTJ perhaps, but INTJs actually get stuff done thus more ""creative"" since they have more drive to actually carry out their visions. Gotta remember too that INTJs actually lead with an intuiting function unlike highly logical Ti for INTPs."
9226,I,N,F,P,Best!!! I loveeee Ishida a lot as Kikuhiko!!!
9227,I,N,F,P,yes
9228,I,N,F,P,"I personally don't think I work well with NTJs as partners, and I never managed to attract ENFJs so we'll see lol"
9229,I,N,F,P,"Of course it's possible. I'm a skeptic and tend to be nihilistic myself.

Actually, I think it isn't that INFPs are stereotypically even optimistic, it's that we tend to daydream too much and not being aware enough of reality. The words used are 'seeing life through rose colored glasses', but personally it isn't actually rose-colored, it's just like living in fantasy of all shades."
9230,I,N,F,P,"people usually say they don't get me, yes xD"
9231,I,N,F,P,best callout of the year

9235,I,N,F,P,my best friend is entj. would you believe that she's been the one who readily shows her actual feelings to me than the other way around (and being more open with it)?
9236,I,N,F,P,I'm Asian and I nearly didn't graduate high school bc of math final
9237,I,N,F,P,For me it depends if there are people or not
9238,I,N,F,P,"I personally never really have conscious thought to change the world in large scale (only myself primarily and my close range surroundings), but being angsty about the state of the world is basically all the time. More like 'we're all doomed' thoughts tho"
9239,I,N,F,P,yes
9240,I,N,F,P,"I can understand the INFPs tho, bc we (as I’m also one) may v well do sth just bc we feel bad abt it 😂"
9241,I,N,F,P,HAHAHA
9242,I,N,F,P,"You can tell them that you don’t wish to talk abt certain things. Ofc, the NFJs also have to restrain themselves from asking and to ask for permission. If you feel uncomfortable, take a little time before approaching them again"
9243,I,N,F,P,From O U C H?
9244,I,N,F,P,"Ouch, this is hard. As an INFP my motivation is my feelings, so when my feelings are whack then I have none. That’s kind of a blessing and a curse.

I’ve never been ambitious in general. However I care abt not failing bc that’ll cause me lots of trouble, so I usually thrive for a safe ground. Weirdly tho, my outputs are often better if I just wing it, which is sort of like being an artist. But it makes finding motivation even harder. If it comes then it comes, if it doesn’t come I can’t always force it. I’ve not tapped into real discipline yet.

So what works for me is... yes, to actually go into school so I wouldn’t let myself fail too much. Deadlines and actual academic retribution and all that, it could help my mind in order. So I surmise job as well, so like, actual responsibilities I just have to get done no matter what. Being a type 6 I just tend to bow to authorities and all that LOL."
9245,I,N,F,P,"My Mom (ISFJ) still remembers things in detail that happened decades ago, even her childhood. She often tests me whether I remember my own stuffs or not and she says abt the lack of it; ""that's because nothing impresses you."" LOL"
9246,I,N,F,P,Depends more on whether the situation involves FP’s values or not
9247,I,N,F,P,"INFP. Graduated med school, gonna pursue public health"
9248,I,N,F,P,Monogamy bc I have 0 energy to cater to more than 1 person and bc anything outside it disgusts me personally
9249,I,N,F,P,I don’t know what’s the perks of being wallflower but ye I got frens but no romance. Unrequited feelings for best friends 2 times HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
9250,I,N,F,P,"Hell on earth (Fi-Si loop)

Every loop is hell on earth, but Fi in combination with Si paralyzes me with mental pain, could only see that everything outside me causes me pain and I usually go to grip real fast aka lashing out in anger at the perceived pain.

When I focus on either Ne and Si I look at a same thing differently. Ne takes it as a more detached thing and Si takes it as a direct offense. Makes me feel unstable at times. I want more Ne pills."
9251,I,N,F,P,"I think kinda half-half... in a way like, internally I understand ISFP better than INTP, but in practice I’m more similar to INTP than ISFP. But I’m oblivious so I wonder to what extent me and INTP are similar."
9252,I,N,F,P,I think it’s more opposite?
9253,I,N,F,P,Ti and Ni prob often overlap in practice
9254,I,N,F,P,"Just slow observation over time, and trying to link that to cognitive functions. Asking other ppl who are confident in their own typing to explain their functions, bc chances are our understanding is skewed. Our perception of ourselves is usually biased, so asking ppl for inputs could be helpful too."
9255,I,N,F,P,"If you pair up with your own type I guess, if we talk strictly types (no other factors involved). Way too comfortable in your own weakness, potential lack of reflection, and when conflict arises it potentially explodes."
9256,I,N,F,P,Being smart isn’t only abt Ti logic tho. Sure it could help a lot but it’s not everything
9257,I,N,F,P,"Yes, high Ne just naturally would want to consider everything. Perhaps down the road they’ll even get truly into it."
9258,I,N,F,P,"Perhaps that’s bc society is alrd mostly fake. If we want to be honest, we won’t fit in anw. Society doesn’t rly allow ppl to be honest, only ppl to be useful to society."
9259,I,N,F,P,"Just like intuition isn’t conscious for N types, I think sensing won’t be conscious for S types too. Ofc by S it basically just means “taking it as it is” and N means “taking it NOT as it is”."
9260,I,N,F,P,"Why don’t u like cursing, what’s life without cursing"
9261,I,N,F,P,Dude all INFPs aren’t actually cinnamon rolls. Sure we look cinnamon rolls but we hide murder
9262,I,N,F,P,"This is such me energy too

On a related note I’m actually one of the shortest ppl I know"
9263,I,N,F,P,Yeah tho you only realize it’s kinky when it’s sth supposedly abnormal. INFP wouldn’t know abnormal even if it hits them in the face
9264,I,N,F,P,"In theory I don’t rly understand it either, but I got a few anecdotes. Note that these ppl are all in their 20s:

- inferior Fe actually is receptive to external mood and does get affected which then makes it want to do sth to solve the situation, but doesn’t always know how. It’s aware that the solution is oftentimes outside Ti.

- inferior Fi does actually know their own feelings and values, tho perhaps not to the same level as a dom Fi. But they could have high intrapersonal intelligence tho. It’s also likely that it appears so because their Te dampens it so it doesn’t rule over them, but they could be pretty aware of the whys of their feelings.

If we are talking about grips then stuffs become chaotically focused. Then Fe grip would be a faux people-pleaser and self annihilator; Fi grip would be explosion."
9265,I,N,F,P,"Yes ofc, but dom Te and dom Ti are rly different creatures. Much easier looking at them than looking at inferior function in my opinion. Unless you only want to know inferior Fi and Fe for their own sake."
9266,I,N,F,P,"Ummm if you want to type ppl, one is very extroverted in general and one is very introverted in general"
9267,I,N,F,P,Please leave the ISFP alone.
9268,I,N,F,P,"I see 🤔thx for clarification

According to INFP standard not rly. I think I only have a few strong principles, and in actuality I’m skeptical and versatile. So I’m neutral good overall."
9269,I,N,F,P,INFP 6w7 649 sp/so (who's now considerably good at sx from like one year of intense practice with dom sx)
9270,I,N,F,P,"Those lean toward INFP alrd methinks. And yeah lol, the organizational improvement is kinda vague to begin with because I don't get Ti myself, but the fact that you also don't rly get it might also tell that you don't actually have Ti. I have feeling INTPs would feel in their bones what 'system improvement' is lol"
9271,I,N,F,P,"* Do not fear mistakes. This is as much as advice for me as it's for you and anyone out there, but -- don't fear mistakes and learn to not overanalyze mistakes. Analyze them to find out what you have to do to move forward and become better, but don't look back because we will never turn back time. In time, everyone will forget our mistakes and most likely it's not even that big a deal to begin with (if this influences your worries). Learn to act with courage and to bear the consequences bravely. Everyone blunders anw.
* Surround yourself with ppl who encourage you to want and do things for yourself -- to balance things out. Avoid toxic ppl who would take advantage of your love for them. 
* It's okay to not have figured things out so soon. From my experience, it does take a while for INFPs to be more 'shameless' despite having Fi. I also started out to be more shameless of my own futuristic wants at 25. I didn't even know what I wanted to do before that. Continue to reflect, but when you know your specific wants -- fight for it, discuss it, negotiate it. I'm glad you have supportive people in your life. This is extremely important for INFP. Ppl who truly love you would want you to be truly happy."
9272,I,N,F,P,"I'd say more INFP. 

My advice is that when there's doubt, look back to when you were a kid. Your first point reminded me of myself and my INFP Dad a lot; I don't actually remember all details myself, but I remember myself as a kid who was easily traumatized mentally by all the little things. My childhood up until 5-6 years old was actually p damn mundane. Still got deeply affected emotionally. Your other points give me some INFP vibes tho I could understand your confusion.

I'm gonna ask more question to flesh out INFP/INTP functions:

* Do you prefer that knowledge can be applied even if for your own self (Te) or do you prefer knowledge for knowledge's sake (Ti)?
* Do you have fascination over organizational skill even tho you may not have it (low Te) or do you think you can improve on them and create your own system (Ti)?
* You may feel affected by the emotions of your surroundings, but: do you know why/the roots of the specific feeling (Fi) or do you have no idea (low Fe)?

Fi isn't always intense. If you don't meet ppl you can fully vibe with, it's hard to get Fi intensity out and in turn INFP would feel 'floating' or 'detached'. I understand personally what you said abt not being your real self around some friends and that it could eat me inside too."
9273,I,N,F,P,I like ppl who acknowledge their ego.
9274,I,N,F,P,"Personally, I'm more true neutral-neutral good. But since I don't live alone and things affect myself and others, my external manifestation is lawful good-lawful neutral. Generally I put myself in lawful good but I don't believe in many laws and absolutes.

I wonder if most ppl don't actually compartmentalize it like I do, but the fact that I do compartmentalization speaks stuff abt myself (hello anxiety)"
9275,I,N,F,P,OH didn’t realize lol. You’re in a good place then

So Korra and Asami ending up in a romantic relationship made little sense to me in the aspect of how they never really formed enough of a relationship in general to both start seeing each other in a different light in such a short amount of time. With all the drama and action that happened in the last season, they barely had time to form that bond. It just felt kind of random and forced. Am I alone here? Feel free to dislike if you disagree.

Day by day, I see my friends and family losing trust in Amazon.

In the effort to squeeze out a few pennies wherever it can, the brand is being destroyed.

With co-mingled inventory, you never know if you will get what you ordered or a Chinese knockoff that has hopped on the listing.

The search results suck - even with exact keywords when you know the product is on there, it can be impossible to find.

Then they let Chinese sellers repurpose listings, so you might want to buy a garlic press and see it has 1,000 reviews, but if you scroll down half the reviews are for a scale and the other half are for a coffee cup.

Finally, for being such a rich man, Bezos treats his employees like garbage. He could have gotten a lot of positive PR when lockdown started, but instead he came out looking even more inhumane than he already did. 

Of course, as a seller, Amazon is absolutely atrocious... I won't even start because we all know the reasons. But if your sellers aren't valuable, and your buyers don't trust you, that doesn't bode well for the future of the brand."

Sorry, but what a loser. 

He purposely tried to hurt you and attack your self-esteem when he was angy - what a little baby!

Weak. It’s a pathetic thing for him to hit you with, and his lack of self-control is embarrassing.

Your purpose in this life is not to be his punching bag while he learns a modicum of basic decency. Do you really want to sit around the next five years being afraid of shit he will say in an argument while he grows up? Just move on. His way of arguing is harmful and pathetic. 

Maybe this time what he said didn’t hurt that badly, but some day he will really say something to devastate you. And you will be stuck with that thing in your head forever. For example, if your dad left as a child, he’s going to hit with, “well maybe if you’d been better at things like this your dad wouldn’t have left.” And yeah, maybe he only says it because he’s having a shit day and his dog died, but you’ll still be ruined. 

He’s toxic. Even if he grows up and gets a little better, this is a character flaw he’s probably decades from being able to control. 

Plus, everyone assumes he will grow up, but it might actually get worse. What happens when he’s REALLY upset some day? How far will he go? Is he cataloguing your soft spots in his head all the time looking for ways to really destroy your self-esteem? I think you’re seeing the beginning of this behavior, not the end. Get out now.

9461,I,N,T,J,">The very fact that bight made the decision to create run bts, so that bts did not need to go on any more variety shows and keep getting mistreated

I'm going to assume you have no source for this.

I'll offer a different sourceless assumption: Run BTS was created for the same reason a lot of BTS content was created - monetization of content, promotion, and marketing.

I doubt that Run BTS was made to keep them from getting mistreated. Bang PD made the CHOICE to send them on Weekly Idol, knowing exactly what kinds of things happen on that show. 

Does anyone truly believe that he would choose to have them do Run BTS if sending them to Weekly Idol paid substantially more than he could make with a Run episode?"
9462,I,N,T,J,"As an INTJ, I respectfully disagree with this.

We share dominant Ni and inferior Se, and I have never gone down the “my friend hates me!” rabbit hole that my INFJ friends constantly do, even when I was a child. 

Even with woefully undeveloped Se, I’ve always been capable of logically understanding that I am not the center of the universe, meaning my friends have other things going on, just as I have.

Sometimes I don’t respond to texts, and it’s because it slipped my mind, or I got busy, and I do this to the people I treasure the most. 

It’a not that I’m incapable of imagining them being a good date or whatever.

I don’t need to imagine that they’re in the middle of some kind of erotic rapture and that’s why they didn’t respond.

Logically, a life-changing experience or probably not the reason they didn’t respond. Can’t they just be not feeling social or need some alone time?

I often don’t respond because I lack energy. I’m not so important that I have to think that they must be on the best date of their LIFE to not reply to me. 

In conclusion, I don’t think lack of developed Se is why INFJs think everyone hates them. I’m not saying I know the answer, but I suspect it’s more related to Fe. 

Maybe it’s more like INFJs think they have a bigger impact on the lives of others than they really do. Just like everyone in the world matters to them, they must matter to everyone else."

“Bad” things happen to everyone. Our concept of bad is relative to our life experiences.

Just because we have bad things happen, we have absolutely no right to be cruel to others. 

I don’t think that people who are cruel deserve for anyone to stay in touch with them.

There is no honor in staying in touch with your abusers as they continue to abuse you. 

Just because they’ve done bad things to you, doesn’t mean you get to do bad things to others and expect them to “learn” to endure it, right?  

I really dislike the narrative that victims are better off if they “act bigger” or “turn the other cheek”.  There is so much societal pressure to endure abuse. 

Sometimes we need to just admit that some parents are mentally ill, cruel, and had kids on accident. Some parents are people who had unprotected sex decades ago, and that’s it. There’s no magic wand waved above their heads when someone gives birth that makes them a decent human being. 

You weren’t put here to be their punching bag or their healers. Spend your energy, time, and love on other kind people, and yourself. If your parents weren’t good to you, then be good to yourself. You deserve it."

9473,I,N,T,J,"As an INTJ, I was interested in this because he talks a lot about the Ni - Se dynamic, which INTJs and INFJs share. 

There were so many things wrong with his rant in terms of Ni - Se.

If he is going to “blame” Ni -Se for things, it would help to remember that INFJ is not the only type with that order of pairing, and that if he is going to make Ni - Se generalizations, they would apply to INTJ as well. INTJs should be able to read his angy rant and learn something as well, right?

When I got to the absolute BS part about sex for Ni doms, he completely lost me.  

Well, that and the fact that he couldn’t keep his anger out of his writing.

If anything, he came off like someone that was trying to “debate” his partner into things she wasn’t comfortable with, and then blaming her Ni for her (healthy) boundaries. Weak."
9474,I,N,T,J,"I agree with the idea that inferior Se might want their environment to be perfect. As an INTJ, I’m like this. 

What I didn’t agree with is the accusation that an imperfect environment will cause complaining. This is not my experience with other INFJs or INTJs at all.

9475,I,N,T,J,"INFJs, please don’t come away from this thinking something is wrong with you.

We're separated now (after almost 2 decades together).  We found that while we get along exceptionally well and are very in sync with the pragmatic things, I am struggling because he's just not very affectionate and doesn't really pay attention to the relationship.  I've heard this is a common problem with INTJs as partners.  For some reason, this is one problem we've never been able to handle well.

Now, I agree that she didn't have the right to ask you to shave the beard, but I think there is something going on where she may not feel heard on something she felt was important.  My personal opinion is that there may be other things where she doesn't feel heard, and you may want to see if there are...and you need to figure out a way for her to signal to you that you're missing something important that is actually making her upset.  That being said, she also has to learn that you have your own thoughts and opinions and may not be willing to back down, so you need to find a way to let her know that she's stepped over the line in asking you to do something.

9531,I,N,T,J,"If I may comment as a non-F type BUT an intuitive. My ISTP doesn’t make me feel dumb. However, sometimes the way my ISTP speaks makes it sound like THEY think I’m dumb. It’s basically just a difference in communication structure. You all are more linear and systematic in your communication. N-types are more conceptual and non-linear. Sometimes my ISTP explains something to me that I 100% understand, but because of the way I talk about it, my ISTP thinks I am missing a critical piece of understanding. The conversation circles we have gone on, only to discover neither of us are actual confused, are ridiculous. That being said, we’ve been married nine years, so nothing two adults can’t muddle through together with enough sarcasm and fun."

Also, being right next to the water allows for control and shutdown you don’t get in a mountainous area. Check your facts before you judge the situation, kiddo."
9543,I,N,T,J,"Well, it’s at a prestigious ESL school, so it creates a different dynamic as far as parents go. I don’t deal directly with parents most of the time. That’s admin’s job. 

One time I am face-to-face with parents is on our open house days. Parents come and watch the class, which can be interesting because meeting their cultural expectations while adhering to my own standards for education can be challenging. Also, kids are much more subdued when their parents are there, which of course makes an impact on the classroom dynamics for the day. Further, some parents are fluent in English, some know a little, some know nothing. Those who are fluent tend to have an idea of what English education should look like, so they can be overly-opinionated at times. 

Classroom management is different for every class year. Different combinations of personalities create different classroom dynamics, so you have to shift your strategies to get the right energy for the group. Working that out is pretty fun. 

For my current class, it’s been smooth sailing for the most part. They like to learn and engage, so it’s been a pretty amazing year already. 

Generally, my preferred method is to build a relationship of trust and respect with the students. If they like you and trust you, they’re more motivated to engage and work with you. When you do have to correct, they tend to actually care about it, and you have the relational currency to not lose them. Also, if kids know you’ll make things fun, they tend to buckle down when you expect it, instead of goofing off.

Kindof sounds like a bunch of Fe-type stuff, but for me it’s a strategy which has served well. Kids learn better when they feel safe and are having fun. I don’t have to yell at them. They know I care, so they care more. And with this particular cultural group, they tend to not get a lot of chances to just be kids. But that’s really what they need to succeed developmentally, so I push toward that."

9547,I,N,T,J,"Well, I first came across it when a friend in a psychology program at uni was instructed to take it by their professor. The professor cited it as the most accurate of the free assessments. I received similar instruction in my Masters of Clinical Counseling program. It gives me the same results as my paid MBTI assessment, along with a much more accurate breakdown and analysis of the components of your type.

Further, 16p is attempting to incorporate Big 5 into the MBTI, therefore it muddies the accuracy of MBTI’s results in the test. MBTI’s goal is to analyze how you cognitively process your world. Big 5 is about personality traits and preferences. Test accuracy is negatively impacted whenever you try to assess for multiple factors in this way.

Can you get the correct assessment from 16p? Of course. But you are less likely to and the analysis quality suffers due to the incorporation of Big 5. As a small example, many types receive the result of INFJ from 16p, including myself. Yet INFJ is supposedly a rare type and an INTJ certainly should not assess as one."

Also, realize your steroids will make you swell. Suuuuuper loose clothing is really critical. Conversely, if you are bringing boxers, you’re going to want briefs.

9574,I,N,T,J,"As a married INTJ, and you kind of touched on this, it’s hard to believe someone would willingly want to be stuck with us forever. It’s so validating and hits so deep that we’re afraid we’re inevitably going to screw it up. For what it’s worth, if you’re patient, his confidence will grow the longer you’re married. Every time he does INTJ crazy and you forgive him and keep loving him, he’ll become more secure that you really love him. 

That being said, someone mentioned attachment styles, and it’s worth looking into. In my counselor training, it’s a big reason why relationships struggle. You have to intentionally go through counseling and self-discipline to deal with attachment issues. Going in blind doesn’t do either of you any favors."

Organization is realistically more about control for me. Organizing my schedule allows me to know my goals or plans will be doable despite changing circumstances. Organizing my external world allows me to find what I need and minimizes distractions. I don’t like someone adding to my schedule without checking with me or messing with my organizational schema.

9640,I,N,T,J,omg this!! I only understood how traumatic my childhood was after I started reading up on my enneagram type
9641,I,N,T,J,"well shit, welcome to r/schizoid group therapy session i guess

My childhood fucking sucked, it's kinda similar to your but not quite. I was born into a pretty rich family, rich enough to hire a nanny and ignore their child for most of the time. Mom was there for the good times, and nanny handled the rest. Dad was absent most of the time, when he was at home he was mostly in his office yelling at someone on the phone. We moved to a foreign country when I was 6, it was the same except now I saw dad even less. When I was 10 daddy left the family, took everything except the kid and the dog. 

Mom had to fire the nanny and deal with having a child, learning a new language, finding a job and battling in a lawsuit. That sure does something to a person. She was still just as absent but now I had to take care of myself. Most of interactions with my mom were her snapping at me for whatever reason and yelling at me for an hour or two. But here's the real kicker, she was a walking contradiction of a helicopter parent and absent parent in one package! So on top of getting verbally abused and neglected, I got my privacy constantly invaded! 

She never really let me do stuff, I couldn't go to my friends houses or to hobbies unless I called her every half an hour. Now, aside from being schizoid I was very independent since young age, so that didn't sit well with me. Eventually I just got fed up with being yelled at so I just stopped socializing or whatever, I was just holed up in my room.

Yelling at me was her go-to for most situations. The concerned counselor called her because her kiddo was suicidal? Yell at the kid, they can't be depressed. Her kid dyed their hair? Yell at the kid. They cry when you yell at them? Yell at them more. They no longer cry when you yell at them? Yell at them some more. You could see how that leads to a person closing up.

I feel like my main caregiver figure leaving suddenly (the nanny) probably took a toll on me, and ofc my dad leaving. I remember my mom sitting me at the kitchen table and just telling me ""Your dad doesn't love you anymore"" wow way to drop the bomb mama, that totally won't leave lasting emotional trauma. I tried to be like okay I guess it's just mom and me now except not, she seems to fucking hate me. I guess it's just me then. I adapted by completely detaching myself from her and focused on becoming as independent and self-sufficient as possible.

For a long time I tried not to resent her, she was going through some shit. But at this point? I'm emotionally fucked over beyond fixing, thanks mom. I'm salty. I could have turned out just fine had you just not used your child as a walking diary."

Tapestry above the bed, an oriental rug between the bed and the cabinet, curtains with some more color/texture and a few houseplants/plant hangers will give the room a cool bohemian vibe! Maybe even some fairy-lights if you vibe with that. 

In whichever direction you take the room, a second bedside table would help balance out the symmetry! Or, you could turn the bed so that it's in the corner next to the curtains, that would make the room more spacious with no space wasted on the sides. I hope that gave you some ideas, good luck!"
9654,I,N,T,J,"yeah, definitely no posters/tapestry/flags :I You could try some funky hanging shelves like  [this](https://store.versodesign.fi/tuotekuvat/1200x1200/tuokko-hanging-shelf-2.jpg)?? I have no other ideas, you've got quite a tricky room to decorate"
9655,I,N,T,J,"Get your posters framed, it makes more difference than you'd imagine! And maybe a houseplant to brighten up the room :) A small indoor tree would fit nicely next to the guitar."
9656,I,N,T,J,5w6
9657,I,N,T,J,"A hanging planter would look dandy! And as others suggested, maybe a small tree or similar large plant, lights, cushions on the chairs..."
9658,I,N,T,J,"Good job dude, I'm proud of you!"
9659,I,N,T,J,She sure has legs for days... weeks..... months......
9660,I,N,T,J,I'm happy to hear it went well!! I hope you two hit it off <3
9661,I,N,T,J,"That's so sweet, I'm so happy for you! I hope it goes well <3"
9662,I,N,T,J,"I love animals, I feel like I can really connect with them. As some have mentioned already, I have a lot of empathy towards them and just want to make sure they're happy and well. I'm vegan, I pick snails and worms off sidewalks, I've worked with farm animals and horses... I think they're just way less complicated than humans, I like that about them :) It's like friendship but without the negative aspects."
9663,I,N,T,J,"It takes so much time and so much conscious effort to let yourself just love without any logical reasoning behind it, maybe he hasn't made sense of his feelings yet and he does love you but isn't aware of it. It's not that INTJs control their feelings, no-one can do that, but they might just not be aware of having the feeling at all, or not know what it is. 

(then again please remember that this is my personal experience being an intj with szpd. each intj is different and most probably don't have personality disorders so you absolutely should take what i say with an elephant-sized grain of salt) 

Universal advice: just give him time and space and don't give up on him, he'll figure it out!"
9664,I,N,T,J,"I think the problem is rationalizing everything too much, they just have calculated that they are not the best match for you so you have no logical reason to care for them

And, well, love is the most irrational feeling of all so you could see how it doesn't mix well with the INTJ-mind"
9665,I,N,T,J,"I have an ENFP friend, I absolutely hated and loathed him the first 3-ish years we knew. I thought he was the most annoying and infuriating human in existence. Then I just somehow got used to him and turns out he's actually the sweetest, I don't really know what happened, my emotions are a mystery to me and everyone surrounding."
9666,I,N,T,J,Oh my god I can't believe Sive is fucking dead
9667,I,N,T,J,"Same, I just feel like me being known on any level = my privacy is being violated. I try to share as little as possible without coming off as rude, or straight up lie. 

I feel like any information I give out can be used against me, any opinion, like, dislike or attachment. God I hate people trying to pry information out of me, wouldn't you like to fucking know."
9668,I,N,T,J,"Herranen aika, mitä sille kävi?"
9669,I,N,T,J,Correct.
9670,I,N,T,J,"Not a bit. My parents were always off somewhere up until I was 9, and I was mostly with a babysitter. I got used to their absence and stopped caring. Then parents got a divorce and the babysitter left, and from then on I was just trying to get away from my now present intrusive helicopter-mother. 

I moved out and now guard my privacy like the biggest treasure there is, not a way in hell that woman is inserting herself into my life. No wonder I'm schizoid with a childhood like that."
9671,I,N,T,J,"yeah, the feeling of belonging in a way... like, yknow, hey! at last im not the outcast! im a part of something! and then it starts feeling like a responsibility weighing you down, like a ball and chain on your ankle, so you get rid of it. you're happy! then you regret it. rinse and repeat"
9672,I,N,T,J,"My own misery can't make me feel a thing, but sometimes if i get really into a movie or a book I can shed a tear or two. Somehow I can comprehend others emotions better than mine. 

What's extra weird is that I usually cry at the happy moments, not the sad ones."
9673,I,N,T,J,Absolutely not.
9674,I,N,T,J,Not to be a 5 but wouldn't the wolves attack the face/legs? Especially since the sheep was probably pretty slow with all the extra weight
9675,I,N,T,J,"That's the sweetest, I'm very happy you found such good friends! It can be hard at times"
9676,E,N,F,P,"I came up with these from my observations. I never said Fe lacked morals or is less genuine. I said first Fi is more genuine with actions and Fe with goals and then I said Fi users are more predictable even if they have **BAD** morals. I said all people have the faculty of being caring, now I add all people can have good or bad morals too, regardless of type. Also I'm not talking in absolutes just what one type is more likely to do then another.

 What I mean by this genuinity thing is let's say you are hanging out with a group friends, you like them and want to make them happy and have a good time (goal) but you are at this moment pissed off or depressed by something, would you ignore your feelings and correct your actions for the group's sake? An Fi user will find it harder then a Fe user  to betray their own emotions so it will be *action* genuine and an Fe user is more ready to follow their goal and tuning their emotions in correspondance to group, in align with having a good time with friends, more social *goal* genuine. I think a better concept for this is the original jungian subjective vs objective but I think action vs goal is a nice alternative way to present it"
9677,E,N,F,P,"they are important and a good heuristic but qualifications or a fancy title alone shouldn't matter for scientific process. Also what type of poeple do you think pays scientist or academic institutions? benevolent and altruistic companies? morally virtuous politicians? do you think they would pay/ them if they say the products they sell damage consumer health/mind or the enviroment? or challange their position in power? maybe yes if it gives more disadvanges to their competition. Ignoring politics influence in academia and how they control the course of scientific progress is a delusional mistake. I don't say all sciencitific endeavour is biased but in the real world there are sure a heavy influence from interest conflicts. 

I know what you mean. I believe your average 'science deniers' are clowns too, but so do scientifism leaning people and positivists who blindly believe in science and the word of their authorities without giving in any thought. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that if you aren't following science authorities then that means you're a stupid like ignorant sciencie deniers, don't fall for that dichotomy"
9678,E,N,F,P,"I agree, english is not my native language so I made a mistake haha I meant 'care' as to care more of what other poeople think, like giving priority to being aware of the external emotional atmosphere, and not 'caring' as in having for default a caring or empathetic nature. I believe all people have the faculty to be caring imo.

Also I believe Fi users are more 'genuine' with actions and Fe more' genuine' with goals, that's why high Fe user can change their Ti beliefs to whatever their goals are, so they are more ready to do bad things if their goals are in line with what's necessary, fair and good TO them. Fi morals and actions are more predictable even if they are bad, they may sacrifice their goals if the actions needed to get there aren't aligned to what they feel is good or right for them."
9679,E,N,F,P,what's so scientific about not being skeptic and having faith on scientific authorities? Skepticism and trying to go out of the box are a base of scientific method

9683,E,N,F,P,Loooool
9684,E,N,F,P,"I agree but, what makes Fe function stronger at this is that they actually care, are interested and get stimulation from reading other people and the group. After years of habitual external observation they get very good at it. An Fi user let's say INTJ psychoanalist may be quite exceptional at reading people 1 to 1 but that's assuming by their profession they are interested in actually reading people.

In addition I think Ne-Si is better at reading familiar people you frequent and Ni-Se at reading unfamiliar people and strangers. For example an ISFP is better than INFP at knowing if an acquaintance likes them but INFP is better at reading their girlfriend/boyfriend I believe"
9685,E,N,F,P,"I have the same concern. I think as long as you don't copy everything you are okay. If you want to get inspired from natural religions I would look for patterns and recurring elements. One pattern I see is that creativity is related to the divine and life-death energies, if you are able to create an imaginary world and 'give life' to it then I think is save to say as the creator of it you have the right to be a god of that world :p"

9783,I,N,F,J,"It is highly improbable, but without proof, we really can't know, can we? 

Winning the lottery is highly improbable, and I don't play because I don't think I'm gonna win. But that doesn't mean I won't win.

Further, saying the pyramids were built by slaves is a much more believable claim than that. I wouldn't even consider it a statistical improbability. Hence, proof necessary."
9784,I,N,F,J,Thank you
9785,I,N,F,J,"No. The default should always be that we aren't sure, not that it didn't. To say for certain one way or the other, it requires proof."

She was very happy. The whole family grew up trilingual back in Iran, so me being adamant about learning our dying language (Lishan Didan) over Farsi (which they learned in school/from others) and Azeri Turkish (Which is what is mostly spoken on the streets) was a bit confusing to them, as they didn't really see the point. But it soon became really emotional to my grandmother, because everyone else can speak English now, and it started off as a means to converse with her. It was a very precious moment when she realized that. My uncle has also been very supportive, quelling everyones input on the matter and stepping up to help teach me.

9797,I,N,F,J,Lol in 2000 BC Jews were probably looser that ultra orthodox communities today. So many customs likely didn't exist back then.
9798,I,N,F,J,"Quasi-arranged.

Under traditional Jewish law, the pair are encouraged to go on ""dates"" first and then both are required to give consent."
9799,I,N,F,J,"Lol it has to be consensual. It is probably illegal under Israeli law and not valid under traditional Jewish law to be nonconsensual. It could be extreme social pressure. In some of these ultra-orthodox communities, not following through with a traditional custom will cause a loss of esteem in your community's eyes. And it is very likely that someone who grew up in one of these communities won't desire that - it is people they've known and expect to live with for the rest of their lives."
9800,I,N,F,J,"Yeah I don't really get this. In traditional Jewish weddings, one still needs to agree otherwise it's not valid."
9801,I,N,F,J,"However, in Judaism (which is being referred to here), it is traditionally the woman setting the terms of the marriage. In traditional Jewish culture, women were the recipients of money. Further, Jewish marriage contracts tend to favor the woman, such as the woman being able to request sex whenever she wants and obligating the man to financially provide for her wellbeing. The marriage contract itself serves as a list of obligations the man has to the woman. In very traditional Jewish society, woman were socially in charge (ie head of family) and men were financially responsible (ie in charge of finances and legal matters). Obviously Jewish cultural worldview has changed a bit over the past few thousand years (it actually remains remarkably similar however). However in very traditional Jewish communities this still persists, and many if not most Jews still get married with a traditionally worded Ketubah (marriage contract), whether or not they actually adhere to it."

9803,I,N,F,J,"Wanting to know about your grandmother has little to do with anyone being biologically related or conceived out of wedlock. Now it will almost certainly come up when researching, so it becomes sticky as you pointed out. 

However, it is your right to know who your family is. OPs parents are not obligated in telling OP family secrets, but they are in the wrong if they are trying to prevent them from contacting other family members who might know. 

It's one thing to attempt to figure out the secret. But trying to keep someone trapped in a bubble so they don't figure something out is terrible. 

OPs parents have every right to choose not to divulge any embarrassing personal secrets. But some aspects of those secrets, such as who one is blood related to, belong to OP just as much as their parents."
9804,I,N,F,J,"It was quite a hyperbole, I concede. It was also not nice, and I apologize.

Regardless, those trails aren't very safe at night for anyone period (especially after that murder a couple years back (/s he was batshit crazy, I hope there aren't too many people like that)). So during the day, you should be good?"

9820,I,N,F,J,"In order to save a life, it is not only allowed but actually religiously mandated to break the rules. Many religious doctors will break certain rules if they are on call in order that they can be called in the case of an emergency.

9821,I,N,F,J,"Right after your quote: 

> Most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group.

Also, no health officials are arguing that wearing masks are 100% effective. But even if they are 2% effective, that effect will compound for each of the of millions of currently infected worldwide. It could prevent millions from dying by slowing the spread enough until a vaccine is created.

Article: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1498_article

9822,I,N,F,J,"Masks not being effective for passing encounters with poeple outside is entirely different from advocating for wearing no masks indoors along with prolonged exposure.

Children *should* be wearing masks. We should be following the precautions.

It is not pseudoscience.

Here are the OU guidelines: https://www.ou.org/covid19/. 

For Piquah Nefesh, it is the right thing to do to slow the spread of Coronavirus until a vaccine is available and widespread.

And articles like these that condone such appalling behavior are a Hillul HaShem."

9827,I,N,T,J,"Same for me but APUSH, not WHAP. My teacher was honestly so nice, her goal was to give us as little homework as possible (which was still about an hour a night but that’s besides the point) and to make sure we’re actually retaining the info. The other WHAP teacher, however, gave out at least 2 hours of work a night."
9828,I,N,T,J,"Not to me. I want a job I can go to, get done, and leave at work, I don’t want any of it spilling into my personal life. I see a job as a necessary thing in life to pay for things I actually want to do in life, that job doesn’t have to be fulfilling in any way."

Even if you don’t believe in the virus and think that the 200,000 deaths are all faked, why would you purposefully want to make a stranger uncomfortable and scared by not having a mask and then start physically beating them for it?! If you don’t like the masks, contact your governors or something, I doubt it’ll do anything but neither is beating up a minimum wage employee so choose the passive route."

9854,I,N,T,J,"My biggest regret in APUSH was not taking deadlines seriously. I know every class is run differently but when my teacher said a project would be due in 4 weeks, that means the project is meant to take 4 weeks to complete, not 2 consecutive all nighters."

9864,I,N,T,J,"I think a scapegoat is whoever doesn’t speak up about being accused of whatever, and, at least from my experience, I don’t care much of what other people, especially my family, think of me as long as I feel I’m doing good, so I was the scapegoat for a while if my parents were mad or something. I started speaking up though whenever they did because it started getting to me and now I’m not the scapegoat anymore."
9865,I,N,T,J,"My church is fairly conservative so most people in there hate wearing masks, so my pastor last Sunday asked if anyone was uncomfortable taking them off for the service and one lady raised her hand so he threw out the idea and everyone kept their masks on.

9868,I,N,T,J,"Yea, that’s why I’ve been playing flute my whole life, it helps me express myself. But what you said about not understanding why people can’t ignore emotions, that’s extremely unhealthy. If you keep suppress your emotions, they’re all gonna blow up in your face and you’re not know what to do about it. I went through a real rough patch in my life and didn’t know how to process what I was feel and I thought that keeping to myself without burdening others was the best route but I ended up forming some nasty habits and was extremely depressed and anxious. Emotions are necessary."
9869,I,N,T,J,"I feel the same way about people, but even though it’s hard, you have to talk to them. It makes me physically cringe when I see texts on my phone or missed calls because I hate using my phone to talk to people, but if you don’t respond, it could give the other person anxiety that you’re not okay or it could look like you don’t care for them or their life. A friend of my texted me when he was suicidal and didn’t flat out say he was contemplating it but he was saying some questionable things and I didn’t reply that night, or even the next day because I didn’t know what to say and figured I could talk to him in person. He opened up to me about it and even though he’s still here today, he could so easily not be partially because of my selfishness in not responding. All that to say: don’t ghost people."
9870,I,N,T,J,I was biking at a nature reserve once and I saw a single deer gallop by real close and thought it was cute but then the whole herd followed after it right behind me and I had to duck out of the way. One of the most terrifying experiences for me

Simple as that, you don't have to ""re-identify yourself uwu"", just fucking break up with them."
9892,I,N,T,J,"I feel this, but then the entire thing about men not being able to show emotions or being called weak over having issues that every human ever had is just pure misandry towards men that have been a thing for long.

For me, I'd argue it's less ""masculine"" to force yourself to hide these things, pretending youre a hyperbolic ""strong"" man when in reality we all have some flaws that we need to work with that don't make us less of a man or a woman. To me, it's manly to show that yes you work through these things and get help for these things, work on yourself and actually become the better you, even if it gets extremely hard often and sometimes might have long periods of just complete depression, not being able to do anything - you're still fighting for yourself.

I do wish more people could recognize this and change their minds about it however, and not in a ""uwu mental illness is so cool"" way, but to just help our brothers out when they feel down."
9893,I,N,T,J,I have nothing more to add except for - Based.
9894,I,N,T,J,"I agree with your post, however a genital prefference in itself isn't bad - the way some people talk about it, automatically assume an FTM doesnt have phallo/meta/both or isn't planning on having one OR uses a 3-1 STP is infuriating.

However, the one thing you pointed out about Transmen being thrown down the ditch as Men Lite TM as if plenty of transmen couldn't be abusive just like cis men etc, is one thing that always makes me pretty much just not want to live, it always makes me feel other'ed because I know in their mind they don't see me as male or other guys as male - just as **F**tm, not ft**M** if that makes sense."
9895,I,N,T,J,"I like it, allthough i feel maybe the beak on the left one will look strange if you make it smaller

9900,I,N,T,J,"I relate heavilly but that missing piece would still be there and eat away at me, in some sense im much happier just being a man than forcing myself to be female and ""relate"" to femoids at all. Id still feel off and it would just prolong suffering either way"

9905,I,N,T,J,"It's not about it having a ""scientific"" name, in this case I highly doubt its an actual scientific name. If it was under the umbrella of a PARAphillia, recognized as an abnormality on similar plane (allthough lesser degenerate) as pedophilia, zoophilia all that trash, it wouldnt be an issue

The issue is this is trying to remove the stigma around chasers, rather than give it a name even if it's degenerate."

9915,I,N,T,J,"Faking a mental illness shouldn't be considered at the same place as actually having it, I'd more see it as some form of cry for help or attention - whatever deeper issue they have. Which in of itself is hard to determine by just 3 or less visits in a lot of cases.

The issue comes from people glorifying these conditions, seeing depressed people as some kind of wise/nihilistic ""angels that want to get back to heaven"", ocd being seen as just ""haha quirky i like to clean everything cause i like it neat haha, all of that shit"
9916,I,N,T,J,Its interestinf that making mental illness and any kind of disorders more accepted with help being more avaible than ever - we have probably rocket levels of people who fake it for whatever reason they might have. Makes you wonder why that is

9923,I,N,T,J,"I agree here with everything you said about communism, additionally virtually all communist regiemes all were against LGBT people as a whole - we'd have no rights either way besides the complete chaos under shit economy.

However I disagree with calling the US an oligarchy, it's still a democratic country, allthough like most democratic country theres still a huge 2 party split since despite all the choices we can make we still gravitate towards just 2 parties. But, what is your reasoning for it being an oligarchy?"
9924,I,N,T,J,"Maybe they would stop ""complaining"" if we actually talked to them? It's not that hard, allthough plenty are hard to reform - but so are people on the left.

Plus, it's not just gender issues."
9925,I,N,T,J,"While some of these people are appropriating trans identity and do it just to push some agender agenda with extreme marxism for whatever reason, I don't think it's the majority.

That being said it does bother me a little bit that there's a very tiny minority of trans people who are right wing and we're often shunned for being right wing, it also bothers me to see unironic communists in trans groups pushing their ideologies towards the face of the trans community as a whole.

I feel like the community itself should stay apolitical"

9956,I,N,F,P,Thank you so much for this comment because I was gonna spend some gems for Abbie and Tyler but if they get together no matter what there’s no point
9957,I,N,F,P,"PTR is actually kind of really good, it’s very wholesome and I fell in love with Ahmed within minutes so uh- plus the whole serial killer headcanon with Elliot makes the book 10x better imo"
9958,I,N,F,P,"Yeah last episode they finally had their moment to shine and now the entire community is complaining because it’s not the same couple they’ve had for like 4 seasons now, I only watch it when the comic aspects shine through but otherwise 🤢"
9959,I,N,F,P,And our fandom is healthy compared to their toxic mess of ship wars 😳
9960,I,N,F,P,Sorry he’s been taken :(

9964,I,N,F,P,I’ll let you know! It depends on if the other person collects him :) sorry if he’s not
9965,I,N,F,P,Basically i got a camper in but I already had a full island so the camper asked to see who would be willing to leave and then Octavian was ‘preparing’ to leave but moved his plans forward so he’s now moving out today :)

9979,I,N,F,J,How many donuts is it socially acceptable to eat in a day? Asking for a friend
9980,I,N,F,J,"I recently tried Tinder. After going on a bunch of first dates, I came to this exact same conclusion.

I also realised how difficult food dates are for me. I’m trying to get food in my mouth without looking like a dumb fuck, enjoy the food itself, make enough eye contact, listen to what he’s saying, respond in a way that feels authentic - with enough wit not just polite laughing. At the same time I have to ask the right questions to get to know him as a person and what makes him tick AND be vulnerable enough so he can reciprocate. TOO MUCH SENSORY DATA"
9981,I,N,F,J,"I did 201 in 2019. It’s a pretty big step up from the previous courses in terms of the amount of vocab you have to learn, but manageable if you attend classes as much as you can. Attendance is compulsory though. 

I think definitely give it a go for the first couple of weeks and that should be enough to get an idea - the workload doesn’t suddenly get more intense later on. It might be hard because you’ll be trying to find a routine for Chinese study as it’s your first course, like personally instead of prepping everyday for the next lesson I tried to get it all outta the way at the beginning of the week.

Feel free to msg and if you want I can send you a couple pics of my textbook."
9982,I,N,F,J,It is in New Zealand

9985,I,N,F,J,"I mean, it's the 31st anniversary today."

9988,I,N,F,J,People deal with their sadness differently though. He can be sad and still want to dedicate something to a friend.
9989,I,N,F,J,"yeah, there were no comments when i posted. this is so so tragic and it hurts to think about what she must've been going through."
9990,I,N,F,J,and might continue to do so if the new episodes are released...
9991,I,N,F,J,"No way! If this is real, that's... fucking horrible..."

9996,I,N,F,J,I love this comment. It makes sense why remembering significant phases of my life is always bittersweet for me - the constant reviewing of what I could have done better to make the most of that time.

10001,I,N,F,J,Go to the Ask Auckland building - there’s a sign post next to gen lib entrance that should point you there

10009,I,N,F,J,I'm using iOS and I'd be happy to edit this comment/send you my review
10010,I,N,F,J,And ambiverts.....
10011,I,N,F,J,"I did a BA/BGlobalSt degree in my first year of university (2018) and I second this! The language component was one of the only things I liked from the degree, switched out of BGlobalSt and am doing a CertLang for my language now. If anyone likes the sound of the Global Politics & Human Rights major, honestly just do Politics and International Relations as an Arts major instead. There's much more choice with courses. Also to add, almost everyone I've spoken to thought Global 100 was poorly planned. The course content could basically have been condensed to a couple weeks' worth of lectures but was so stretched out over the whole semester. I remember one week we had a wellbeing person from the university come in and talk for two hours about dealing with stress as a filler lecture...

Feel free to shoot me a PM if anyone wants to chat. I do know LLB/BGlobalSt students who enjoy the degree because it's a nice contrast to law papers, though I reckon they'd feel the same if they were doing an Arts degree too."
10012,I,N,F,J,"Don't worry about trying too hard on it. There's thousands of applications across the university and I doubt they'd do more than skim each one, I think a lot of the selection process is by chance anyway. (Was in UHT last year)"
10013,I,N,F,J,"The lectures are a snooze but the coursework itself is fairly straightforward. Just be prepared to do quite a bit of self-learning. Good thing that with the essays, oral presentation and exam you get to choose your own topic out of a long list provided, so you only have to do research on your chosen one (schools of thought is one topic as the other comment said). Feel free to PM me if you want the textbook pdf by the way, it's a lifesaver when it comes to the weekly quizzes because Ctrl+F. The essays can also be tricky in terms of analysis so make sure you talk to your tutor. I definitely didn't like Hoadley's teaching style, but the content itself was interesting and the course is a prerequisite to a few other Politics papers!"
10014,I,N,F,J,"Have you found it yet? Security building, Arts Student Centre, OGGB Help Desk, Library, are other places that have lost and founds."
10015,I,N,F,J,"It was okay! I had Vanya as my course lecturer and she was lovely, clear in her explanations, and going to her office hours helped a lot. Tutorials were so dead and devoid of discussion which was not what I expected from a Phil course. Grades that I got seemed inconsistent to me: B- for my first essay, A+ for my second, and then for my exam I think I went down in the B range again. Because feedback was hardly given with my essays I still don't really know how I improved or where I went wrong. Of course, the Philosophy essay structure of argument, rebuttal, counter-rebuttal, etc. may come easier to you than it did me. Just my personal experience."
10016,I,N,F,J,"I personally found 3 bearable, but 4 was when it started to drag and I'd lose concentration. I would say stick with the 3 back-to-back, it's better to get it done with rather than finding the motivation to attend a single class sometime later in the afternoon, especially when you're already back inside halls."
10017,I,N,F,J,"After look at the student course review site, even though this course seems pretty interesting, there were a lot of bad reviews on it. Does Reddit say the opposite?"
10018,I,N,F,J,"Thank you. For me, it comes down to whether I want to take Marine Science, Environmental Science or Ecology - two of these majors. Do you think it would be repetitive if I took both Marine Science and Ecology?"
10019,I,N,F,J,"Yep. Sad because I don't have 3G, so that complicates my life"
10020,I,N,T,J,Chad Reptile Enjoyer
10021,I,N,T,J,"Ok bucko. Didn’t realize I owed anyone anymore reason than I just said. If I can’t have a character I’ve been playing the most for well almost two decades, then I’m not with it."
10022,I,N,T,J,"I dropped MK11 when it was only 2 months old. Game is literally unplayable for me because Reptiles isn’t on the roster. That’s been my main forever.

EDIT: Down voted to oblivion because y’all hate Reptile? That’s cool I guess."
10023,I,N,T,J,"I've been playing guitar for roughly 8-9 years now. My twin brother (INTP) is a bassist. I also write lyrics, sometimes poetry. We play predominantly Metal."
10024,I,N,T,J,Not particularly a fan of it. I don’t hate it though. I do enjoy it at some odd times but I mainly listen to and love Metal.
10025,I,N,T,J,Get help.
10026,I,N,T,J,Cold coffee and Heavy Metal for me. I do it once every one or two weeks. Depends when I make enough time for it.
10027,I,N,T,J,23M. Right before I left for a big field exercise with another Company I was attached to in November.

10030,I,N,T,J,That I can go for 2 straight hours without nutting. Sex ofc.
10031,I,N,T,J,You’re fine. At first it just seemed off topic and rude. That joke kinda went over my head as well. Cheers
10032,I,N,T,J,Never tried it. The shirt I was wearing in this picture has PBR which stands for professional bull riders. Don’t know where you came to the conclusion where a 4 year old kid is a fan of beer.

10085,E,N,F,P,Yea but not everyone wants to see our dark side or can appreciate it

Of adhd. Like use the energy to get things done. Or my definition of done. Until I move to something else. Then go back to the previous thing. I have found how to be able to harness my particular energy and attention span, in a way that works for me and makes me more productive than when I was in my head or passive for most of the time. Hope this makes sense . Pm me I’ll give you some tips"
10098,E,N,F,P,Quite lovely people those intjs
10099,E,N,F,P,Well my definition of ‘finish’ which just means “to my satisfaction or until I get bored” 🤔

The dialogue is amazing. The attention to detail in their personalities is noteworthy. As well as a consistency that makes them feel like real people and not just characters. 
As an enfp. I see myself in both of them. Watching them interact is interesting because that’s exactly how us intuitive’s talk when we meet a fellow intuitive that we vibe with . My conversations with Infj/intjs have been exactly like this."
10108,E,N,F,P,"Uggh, dream team indeed"

10124,I,N,T,J,"It's okay, it's not a lot of poop, because as you get to the last few weeks, you can't eat a lot anyway, as your stomach and intestines are so compressed from the baby taking up space. 

Sometimes none comes out at all, the thing about contractions is that in the early stages of labour it feels very much like period pain, and of course those hormones give you the runs!! So you possibly have already voided your intestines by the time established labour happens.

10130,I,N,T,J,"Put the time into the work and get paid for it, totally, you take time off to do other your career gets held back. It's logical. But there's a knock-on effect. Western countries have some of the lowest birth rates in the world, and it's correlated to higher education of women. But that's not just because ""herp derp I can use contraceptive"". It's directly because of WHY women pursue higher education - to get better paying jobs in higher status careers. And to have a child would stall that career track. So naturally, they have children later, have fewer children or don't have them at all (accounting for other physiological  and social factors)  


So it's a weird attitude of Western Countries to have such a negative view of well... people making families. Having children is a choice... and Western countries say that statement implying that you should shoulder that like a terrible burden, effectively treating it like they should be punished. Which is weird, there doesn't seem to be any logical reason not to view it as valuable work and a worthy goal worth rewarding in some way - that is if you actually want a future population.  


If I suggest a living wage to mothers to reward them for populating the country that has below replacement level birth rates, those to the right of me will bristle - which is telling of how they view children and family as being low value. I'm not saying do that, but it reveals the biases."
10131,I,N,T,J,"Six months off work, even if that's only the maternity leave is a significant amount of time, that when you return to work is not just stepping back into stride for most workers- six months off puts you significantly behind in most high paid fields and can cost you a promotion. That's if you can get back to full time right away: logistically and financially most weigh the cost and realise that it's not practical - [forcing them to go part time at most](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/).   


Deciding to stay home to raise them is based on a lot of factors, some choice, some lack of choice - but the bottom line is that child rearing is the biggest contributing factor to wage disparity on a longitudinal scale.   


The quickest and most logical way of closing that gap is to pay them to raise their kids. But I'm sure everyone will hate that idea ;-)"

Ie: that a million people are dead this year because the world is harsh and cruel spontaneously of its own accord, and the people in it are clueless and stupid and have nothing under control. 

It's much nicer to think this is all a planned conspiracy you can blame on intelligent and wicked people and entities. THEM. The alternative is to realise that much of the blame lies on our own shoulders, for being stupid, selfish, cruel ourselves and willfully ignorant. It's always ""someone else"" who is at fault.

Taking responsibility for himself is exactly the thing he was trying to avoid with the conspiracy, getting it will unlikely change that. There's always someone else to blame even if you have to invent it."

Charge just on the low end of market rate for comparable size work on the internet. Check with other artists listings to see what the going rate is. It's better because you'll encourage buyers to pay fairly to other artists as well by aligning with them.  


Also if anyone tries to talk you down, don't bother explaining to them. You are allowed to charge whatever you like and they are free to sling their hook somewhere else. A worker is worth their pay. Meaning, time is money and you're spending too much time negotiating with them when you could be using it for something else. They're not real customers, they're time wasters.

I'm reading through and I have to put on my hat of questioning the assumptions of the writer. He seems impressed and emotionally indifferent about the system itself. I'm seeing a lot of ""I thought this"" approaches to his sentences. ""I cannot recommend the system"" to which goes on at length about his own reasons, his personal reasons.   


Is he asking if lots of other people what they thought of it? He said there ""is a reddit"" and he ""spent time in the facebook group"" but if I were to go back and ask the admins of that group who he is, what will they know about him? Is he polling the Tribe for their reasons? I can tell you that he had a tendency to drop in every two weeks, make a bold assertion about his own opinion and then replied to exactly zero comments. If lead Ti I'm expecting to see that, an attitude that you need to align with me, my opinion is this: sez me, you need to convince me otherwise... oh by the way, good luck with that!  


If lead Ti, I should see a similar void of Fe, not caring that people like it. Blaming others for his bad feelings about it. Over and over again is the refrain, ""This doesn't seem true to me, I'm not convinced."" If the deciders were in the middle you could say ""Eh, people like it, no harm done."" But for him, there is harm in liking something that he doesn't think is true, so now you gotta HEAR about how untrue it all is and how disappointed you're going to be with self help gurus and not SCIENCE. AM I going to be disappointed? Or just him?  


And what makes him qualified to tell me what I should and shouldn't like or read? Well... because he says so! He doesn't give his own qualifications, or experience in personality typing or psychology or anything! His opinion has merit because it's HIS opinion. For me that gives off pretty big ""staring at the back of your own eyeballs"" energy.  


And if anyone says to him, Hey dickhead, we all like this and have found it effective, no one gives a shit about about your opinion? Is that the big tidalwave, giving your opinion and then no one caring? But I'm right! says me. When someone thinks they're right and doesn't want to hear that they are wrong, or that maybe it doesn't matter that they're right about this...

Make sure you tell your colleagues the name of the parent so they can deny service to the father.

10163,I,N,T,J,"I feel like it's a bad argument if the judgement is still thought of in human scale. The first thing to understand is that God is a perfect being. Not by human standards if what we like and don't like, or what the morals of the present day are.

He's perfect as both an innate property and as an inscrutable standard. He's perfect in a way we can never grok because we are not Him, and that perfection is an unalterable innate trait and his laws to humanity stem from that. We aren't really condemned because we break laws (although we do) we're commended because even if we're as good as Job was, and are blameless, we're still not at the standard of a literal God, and since nothing imperfect can stand in the presence of God, we stand to be destroyed.

So that's the importance of the restored relationship with God, that Jesus imports himself in us, nulls the sin we committed and then when God the Father looks on us, he sees the perfection of Jesus, which is himself, and we are not destroyed.

So that's the fear I think - understanding the scope of the standard that we fall short of. It's not that we're naughty little kids disobeying the law, because even Cain did wrong before there were laws. It's because the standard is impossible - Jesus was pressing on that point a lot in the gospels."

Our approach to success wants quick results when in fact if you really wanted to be ""impressive"" in some domain, you just need to track the skills needed for that domain, tie it to your current skillset and move forward with that.

And for some reason, history seems to point out that once we find answers through science we're all into logic and once the science doesn't explain things the most logical ones break down and pray to the maniac deity. 

Also I'm not sure where you live but in everyday life I barely meet anyone slightly open minded or logical. And for the right wrong theory, if children have a sense of it than adults have enough resources to keep that sense and some religion won't take that away. God's more about belief and beliefs don't care about your biased truths... the day God can be proved or disproved I'd be all with the conclusion of making people see but right now it's your theory against mine and I'd rather not be stubborn on anything and live and let live."

Internet has everything from huge collection of pornography to snuff films and everyone has access to it...

Looking at today's society you realise that, that is a requirement... being too nice is being a pushover and evetually being dismissed and being too aggressive is being an oppressor. 

I can only imagine what person won't punch a guy back in the face if he could if that guy tried to punch him first.

Murder is avenged by murder usually in today's justice system and as for corruption it can be described as violating rights of the poor or the oppressed. At the same time it's also true that taking a life is condemned very very much and survivg or saving one is lauded.

The actually peaceful religion could be buddhism but if I believed in a God I'd be very irritated if he told me to sit on my ass amd pray for things to be okay."
10188,I,N,T,J,"In the past the whole game was that men worked outside and earner while women worked inside and made sure the guy had a comfortable home and all his emotional needs were being met. Moreover, it was frowned upon when woman went out and tried doing things on their own.

I agree today both of them should have ambition but as a rather stubbornly independant women who can't just bear depending on a guy for money, women sometimes aren't thought of as competent, may not have as high salaries and probably if they are married will be taken less seriously... now a few of us do make it, but there are sacrifices that are made. Some just give up and use the one thing they are again still judged on i.e. looks.

We're in a very in between stage as a society and the moment and having ambitions and making it through are different things but yes you shouldn't be looking at another person to depend on... also women's worth is often defined to this day by if she's married and has kids and her biological clock runs out etc there's peer pressurle...

There was a box for friends and that box had a personality which wasn't a lie just not everything. I was too often in my head and I acted such that it would make people not intrude in on my time. Also, apparently not caring about having friends somehow attracts people because you're a mystery.

Most of my life I'd have empathized with being misunderstood, now I just want to get out and make sure I make people understand what needs to be understood because I want to make a difference."
10197,I,N,T,J,Having read A LOT on it... humans are just too unpredictable and run by emotions and to control that takes too much discipline and planning... plus even the controlling groups can't be that smart to calculate right for so many people and they have to have their illogical moments. It sounds interesting and aligns with some religious scriptures as well and I can admit that someone's probably trying but really?
10198,I,N,T,J,"Yep, my bad should've mentioned."
10199,I,N,T,J,Maybe I was trying to fish for compliments.
10200,I,N,T,J,"Being called adorable is rather irritating. If you believe soul child theory, the 8 within kind of roars at this."
10201,I,N,T,J,"Just know 1 of each wing but the differences:

9w8 is messy, emotions are mire obvious if there are any, more adventurous. Is an ISFP

9w1 is extremely neat, appears more grounded, more closed off but more anti-control. Is an INFP"
10202,I,N,T,J,Switch adorable from 5 to 4? Or 5 to 7? Even 3's should be called adorable instead of 5s
10203,I,N,T,J,Ok fine! I'll try to share my gems of wisdom *shudders* from time to time.
10204,I,N,T,J,"As a woman, yes things can get dramatic but I wouldn't say all the girls are like that. You're one as well and so are all the other less ""dramatic"" women. Growing up with brothers, when I had my female circle of friends, not being straight forward did bug me a lot and there surely were things going on behind the scenes but it happens even with guys. And no I'm not trying to be politically correct."
10205,I,N,T,J,"When someone told me, would be politely dismissive...

low-key research it a few days later to get informed and decide how much I agree to it if my curiosity is piqued."
10206,I,N,T,J,"I like reading, doesn't mean I like posting or reading about myself... let. me stay in the background won't you?"
10207,I,N,T,J,Second it as another woman.
10208,I,N,T,J,"You can probably at best estimate the concentration of certain enneagram types in enneagram related communities by conducting a survey on a couple of forums and take weighted average although what u/enneman9 mentioned will definitely skew data. A certain type of ppl are attracted to reading stuff like this.

Maybe start making database with the help of few other people and type anyone and everyone on youtube which ofcourse is again a hard task and might be inaccurate. Can imploy objective personality method by having 3 or 4 ppl type the same person and use the type with highest freq.

If you want to put in the work there are other ways to get the data that might be close to accurate but if you just want to look at stats without any work and are ok with bias, best idea is to see the studies done so far and observe the validity of those to obtain an estimate.

I wouldn't put my faith in those stats though."
10209,I,N,T,J,"That people will come to this party and i'll be the only host having to cater to everyone

Also of being incompetent, stupid, uninformed, generally incapable at what I NEED to be good at."
10210,I,N,T,J,4 sounds pretty hard tbh and here I thought we had it hard. Hope you find your unique thing and be lauded for it while no one can really relate and they all applaud the utter originality of it and like it in awe but can never quite get it.
10211,I,N,T,J,Wish I had a 3 close by.
10212,I,N,T,J,"I clearly stated that I'd objectively asses the stats you present... if they make sense and are not just data skewed to get desired results, why wouldn't I agree?"
10213,I,N,T,J,"I guess you go by ""deflection is the best reflection""... but ok!"
10214,I,N,T,J,"I'll look at the stats, then I'll probably come up with an understanding of perspective those stats provide and if they make sense, why won't I agree? Data doesn't lie but data sure can be corrupted as well as represented in ways to present a certain point of view.

EDIT: As for not caring what anyone thinks or if anyone agrees, if that were the case you'd not argue the point... we want ppl to agree with our conclusion as a general behaviour because most of us want to be assumed as rational beings and take pride in convincing others ""less"" rational than us if we're say arrogant."
10215,I,N,T,J,"Writing this took considerable time I assume, adding one link might have not taken that much and yes i might not agree but i'll be forced to give you counter strike or atleast be quiet."
10216,I,N,T,J,"Make up a resource so every time you have to state the argument, you can cite or refer to that resource. More validity to your argument. 

It paints a really bad picture if people are not willing to do the dirty work for their arguments and that's how false information gets propagated. At least have some data backing you up, if you're claiming something about 50% of the population."
10217,I,N,T,J,Give a link to the data...
10218,I,N,T,J,"The problem is you can't prove a negative and unless you have all the stats on the causes of these divorces, it's not entirely a valid comclusion given you can always frame stats to serve your agendas."
10219,I,N,T,J,"As a woman, I find this opinion a bit unjust but to each their own maybe I'm misinterpreting. 

In this day and age, we have access to enough resources to make informed choices. Being a ""manwhore"" or ""slut"" : 1) is an ill defined term often used in self-serving context 2) is no one's business because ""everyone"" can make a choice 3) women aren't victims and men aren't predators by nature... we make our choices and are accountable for it.

As for damaged, well life is a piece of cake for no one and being a so called ""slut"" is absolutely fine as long as you're ok with it and so is not being a ""slut""."
10220,E,N,F,P,So beautiful!!  💕
10221,E,N,F,P,Wow! Great job!! You look beautiful!
10222,E,N,F,P,Holy hell whatcha been doing!?
10223,E,N,F,P,So beautiful!!!💕
10224,E,N,F,P,Oh wow is that cool!
10225,E,N,F,P,"Cool I may try it again. I just have like 15-20 lbs I wanted to lose by next month if possible. Trying to figure out the best way. 

Thanks for the info!"
10226,E,N,F,P,Why were you and the kids not there at family day? That sounds like the point of the day.
10227,E,N,F,P,How's that working for you so far? I'm thinking of trying adf I again.
10228,E,N,F,P,Congrats! It's beautiful!
10229,E,N,F,P,Type 7 and same. 😀
10230,E,N,F,P,Same! 😂
10231,E,N,F,P,So cute!!
10232,E,N,F,P,Its beautiful!!! 💕
10233,E,N,F,P,Love it! 💓
10234,E,N,F,P,Wow dude that's incredible! 😲
10235,E,N,F,P,Man it really is crazy. I want to what's up. Our metabolism can't be that out of whack can it!? I only have about 20 lbs to lose and I'm in a healthy weight range I guess. Atkins worked for me years ago but I think it messed up my metabolism so I don't want to do it again. I'm vegan too so it's really too restrictive.
10236,E,N,F,P,Yeah I did it one week a long while ago and it was great. I lost 6 lbs that first week and then I went off because I wanted to try something else but this time it just did not work at all. I do well if I stop eating at 6pm tho. That helps.
10237,E,N,F,P,"Man, I wonder what's wrong with us!? 

Not cool. 🤨"
10238,E,N,F,P,"Man, I wonder what I did wrong or if it's just my wretched metabolism??? 

I stopped doing it because I felt like I was just gaining and losing the same 3 pounds. 

Morning after fast day - down 3 pounds 
Morning after eat day - up 3 pounds. 

You guys results are awesome."
10239,E,N,F,P,So beautiful!!!
10240,E,N,F,P,Yeah I get that. You just get used to eating differently and is just what it is and its not even hard anymore. Such a trip.
10241,E,N,F,P,Yeah just tell him not all activities are great naked for both of you so for stretching out working out maybe put shorts on our go in another  room....unless of course you don't mind that I'm no longer attracted to you and we never have sex.
10242,E,N,F,P,Next time ditch the oil. It's not healthy and ads nothing beneficial.
10243,E,N,F,P,Congrats man! I kinda had a similar mental shift recently and just sort of realized not every meal needs to be a party so now I just eat healthy all the time and will have my party meals on occasion when I'm out with friends or whatever. Good luck and keep on keeping on!
10244,E,N,F,P,Where I it!? It's beautiful!
10245,E,N,F,P,Where is it? Its gorgeous!!
10246,E,N,F,P,"Tell her that she can throw you all a reception if she likes?? 

Tho the husband needs to tell her this is what you all wanted and it has nothing to do with her and its super selfish of her to be anything but happy and supportive about it."
10247,E,N,F,P,Yep. Enfp mom here. 🥰
10248,E,N,F,P,"You're right haha I just came back to possibly edit that post because it was so negative. 😀

Plus I quit smoking at the same time so I should just be happy I didn't gain weight I guess and I've been working out so maybe I'm gaining muscle too. 

I just know there have been  times that I was just busy and just ate smoothie all day or something and would lose like 4 lbs that day so I guess I was expecting more for 21 days."
10249,E,N,F,P,"I just started August 1st after watching a documentary. I just decided to do it for August to challenge myself and see how I felt. 

I feel great and I like eating this way but I suppose I'm disappointed also because I expected to lose weight. 

I have lost 5 lbs but I kinda thought I'd lose 3 times that much already. I was pescatarian before and didn't eat a whole lot but I would eat toaster strudels and scrambled eggs with cheese and veggies etc and now I'm full on eating rabbit food all day and 5 pounds?? 🥴

Which would be fine and all but I'm trying to lose weight for my wedding and I don't have much time."
10250,E,N,F,P,Yeah for sure I am. Many enfps are.
10251,E,N,F,P,"I am only on week two so I'm not sure how much this is worth yet but so far for me it was a mental shift in much the same way as I had when I stopped eating meat about 4 years ago. 

When the reason is ethical instead of just my personal health goals it became easier somehow. 

I recently watched a documentary called what the health and it just made sense. Now it's like when you know better you do better, you know. 

Like, I just really don't want to put junk in my body anymore. 

Hoping this feeling lasts because I'm feeling really great so far. 

Just keep your focus on your goals. Do it for the family you want to start. 😊"
10252,E,N,F,P,Should we just replace her with someone you do like? 😂
10253,E,N,F,P,"Interesting. I've literally said the same to my infp fiance about why he is a good match for me. 

Enfp people also like puzzles and need someone that surprises us. It's not good if we figure you out too easily."
10254,E,N,F,P,The kids aren't good in either of them but everyone else is good in pic #2. Id just use that one.
10255,E,N,F,P,"I think you're awesome for the things you've tried and for wanting to do more. 

Literally the smallest thing can be romantic. Just a pause and look of love while she's talking to you and a slow lean in for a kiss. 

Or a look and reaching for her hand. 

Surprising her with a candlelit dinner for just you two. 

Putting on some music while you're cooking and just  grabbing her for a little dance in the kitchen. 

Bringing home flowers. 

Also, initiate sex too. Just don't do it in the same way all the time. 

Just get close to her and take her face in your hands and kiss her.  Kiss her slowly..and maybe bite softly on her lip. Make it feel sexy and sweet. That's romantic."
10256,E,N,F,P,Congrats!! Whoohoo! So exciting!
10257,E,N,F,P,"I love listening to other enfps talk too actually or reading them talk in this case because I just love it to death that we all have a similar rhythm to our speech that's just so us haha. It makes me happy and understood like....aww my peeeople....💕

And to you  swwet infj person thanks for saying so. Aww 🥰"
10258,E,N,F,P,Thanks so much! We're planning on a Wednesday in November. Hopefully it'll still be open in November! It's such a gorgeous location! I love your outfits too BTW! 💕
10259,E,N,F,P,Thank you! So I could just hire any officiant probably and do it. I'll look into it! Congrats and thanks for the info!
10260,E,N,F,P,Im wanting to transition to this as well and my family doesn't want to either. I plan to start meal prepping on Sundays so I can just grab a container from the fridge for my meals.
10261,E,N,F,P,"Awesome! I was told by someone, I think simply eloped that they no longer allowed ceremonies here! This was my choice too. May I ask who married you? Took photos etc?"
10262,E,N,F,P,Almost burnt.
10263,E,N,F,P,YouTube has endless awesome tutorials. You can also check Creativelive.com
10264,E,N,F,P,Yeah and women really hate wearing bras but we do it anyway. Now you all know. 😀
10265,E,N,F,P,You get to do this day however you want! I'm eloping but still want epic photos which means my dress has to be amazing too. 😀
10266,E,N,F,P,All you need to know is he said none of your business. Holy hell! What a perv. You gots to go! There is legit no normal reason for that.
10267,E,N,F,P,"Man, how'd you manage both at the same time? That feels hard."
10268,E,N,F,P,You know...as it turns out when you like your job you might just work all the damn time.
10269,E,N,F,P,Damn it. I keep going back and forth between asheville and Charleston. You're making it harder! 😀
10270,E,N,T,J,honestly these are all districts of the city state that is Malta. My grandparents village is bigger than some of these so called cities

10283,E,N,T,J,"I still think there's a limit to how much crime you can allow. Seems like looting, pillaging & murdering has gone unpunished, and if that's like that then this commune too. Sends the wrong message to criminals"
10284,E,N,T,J,I identify with the last one
10285,E,N,T,J,They hace occupied 6 blocks. You think they care about taking from others? Taking from others is the point here
10286,E,N,T,J,"I think Trump will let it play out for everyone to see how these idiots ruin their own so called commune, and why anarchism doesnt work.
But what do I know, I'm just a white nationalist"
10287,E,N,T,J,"Ah, such is life. You generally can not have things you can't afford, unless someone gives them to you as charity or you steal them.

P.s. I thought this was just a protest and not an actual attempt at a coup to secede from the USA? Why does a protest need its own currency?"
10288,E,N,T,J,"Pay for what you use, at the very least.
Want to be autonomous? Don't rely on people coming from outside"
10289,E,N,T,J,"I agree with him.
You did say ""you are now leaving the USA"". Tell me it was a joke, you say that to cover for the failure of your so called ""commune"" 
Go back to your mommas"

10306,E,N,T,J,"Honestly, I started thinking thr same thing. Thanks for the advice."
10307,E,N,T,J,"Thank you for your insights, it was very understandable. I'd been planning to leave for some time now, it's not what I envision doing and I'm still young, so I have the capacity to pursue other things. I think will do what you say to see if it can make a change."

10323,I,N,T,J,"1. ALL stereotypes are bullshit. Your period is a very, very personalized experience and different than everyone else's. 
2. If you experience discomfort, you could pin point exactly when that happens so you can be prepared, and you could do that by using the app Clue. It's a period tracker, and does way more than a calendar. Very informative as well. Highly recommend it. 
3. Extreme changes in mood before your period are normal. When I say extreme I mean going from fine to deeply sad the next day, for no ""real"" reason. 
Mine happen like a week before bleeding and last for 1-3 days and then I'm fine. 
4. Your body needs more energy when you're on your period, being hungrier is normal.
5. You'll also be sleepier than usual (more naps yay) 
6. Heating pads and warm towels are your best friends!! And layers of blankets as well. If the pain gets too much, take a painkiller pill. It's totally fine. 
7. Last but not least, have a pair of period pants. What are they? They're baggy, comfortable and chunky sweatpants that go easy on your sore muscles and keep your belly warm. 
That's about it! You can always DM me if you've got any questions."
10324,I,N,T,J,literally every single detail in this is wrong
10325,I,N,T,J,I love your braids
10326,I,N,T,J,"also, the game silent hill 2- wait you only asked about the movies"
10327,I,N,T,J,"his eyes look a bit dead, his mouth looks a little weird. if you zoom in, the tip of the nose looks like it has different texture than the rest of the face. in all honesty, it's not awful but it could've been better"
10328,I,N,T,J,"I've only heard that if it's less than 50% ""liked"" then it appears in the recommend section less often, could even not get recommended anymore. Not sure about it, though."
10329,I,N,T,J,does it actually affect your sight? please don't do it remotely because of eurocentric beauty standards!
10330,I,N,T,J,"I think you look great and I love your eyes especially. What I think you would love is more attention around the eyes and eyebrows area. I myself have a wide nose and the way I take attention from it is by thickening the brows and/or making them bolder in general. Also your eyebrows are high enough to allow you to practice all kinds of makeup looks and all. Even something simple as a winged liner. And also, if you ever wanted to buy lashes, I'd recommend cat-eye style ones, I think they'd look gorgeous on you. 
I don't think you need a nose job. If you want more definition you could always contour"
10331,I,N,T,J,"I wouldn't recommend a buccal fat pad removal. The fat shrinks as you age, if you remove the fat, maybe you will age not so gracefully. I think you look great. You have a good jawline and chin. If you wanna look more ""awake"" maybe you can do something to reduce the bloating in your face. Carbs and salty food make anyone look bloated. Id recommend a clean diet and some exercise, like walking or running, for a more awake look."
10332,I,N,T,J,This makes me feel so much better about my wide ass face and jawline
10333,I,N,T,J,it should say on the bottle how long it can be opened for. Did you experience any harm before that date? Like did it say 12 months on the bottle but made your eyes itch after 8?
10334,I,N,T,J,I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS ALONE
10335,I,N,T,J,"The tip will drop by 10 to 15 degrees. Takes a while. Also, you could have swelling up to 18 months if you're thick skinned."
10336,I,N,T,J,"Yes they're gone. I wish all his streams could stay. The Until Dawn streams were hilarious and very spooky. I think I read somewhere that the streamer can decide how long the streams are up for, but I'm not sure. Maybe if we tell him to extend the 2 month period, he will"
10337,I,N,T,J,he'd make that hilarious

10340,I,N,T,J,I'd check everything tbh
10341,I,N,T,J,he's just so calm and it makes me feel calm as well
10342,I,N,T,J,??? I'll just make a new one and use it with my VPN
10343,I,N,T,J,yes they still look good on you but for me not so much :( probably because our skin types are different. i might get mine removed tbh
10344,I,N,T,J,you guys should keep in mind that the long-term results depend on your skin type. if you've got an oily skin or oily-combo id suggest you stay away from microblading as the inked hairs will fade and it won't look good.
10345,I,N,T,J,you look so stunning! i can't wait to lose mine!
10346,I,N,T,J,it's khahar for you
10347,I,N,T,J,I've noticed
10348,I,N,T,J,alright then :/
10349,I,N,T,J,you are gonna hate yourself for sure cause that game pack ain't even worth 7 bucks.
10350,I,N,T,J,"""full"" of star wars? you should watch a gameplay video of it on youtube... half the shit can't even be interacted with and there is little to no gameplay."
10351,I,N,T,J,Same here in Iran! We can't even buy them even if we wanted to
10352,I,N,T,J,wayne goss did a video on it. he explained how to contour many nose shapes and also pointed out some common mistakes
10353,I,N,T,J,this is so pretty!
10354,I,N,T,J,This is straight up just a sim with alpha cc
10355,I,N,T,J,oh my GOD
10356,I,N,T,J,"wait, the player gets to renovate houses and lots??? or did i misunderstand ???"
10357,I,N,T,J,Thank you! I love to build and renovate but since I didn't have any packs when I was playing it I never really got the full experience of the game. And with everyone loving the gameplay I'm honestly thinking of going back.
10358,I,N,T,J,that's actually a smart trick 🤨
10359,I,N,T,J,you guys are making me wanna go back to the sims 3!!! should i do it?? i have time :)
10360,I,N,T,J,You did great<3
10361,I,N,T,J,"google ""kylie staged paparazzi"". it's the photos where she's wearing a white crop top and jeans"
10362,I,N,T,J,Ok? This happened a few times years ago it's not like my life is in danger everyday. U stay safe too
10363,I,N,T,J,"Bold of you to assume atheists can't be savagely sexist. That without religion, violence against women would not exist."
10364,I,N,T,J,ngl i hate it here
10365,I,N,T,J,"Tbh I rarely meet someone who approves of the acid attacks. If at all. Straight up psychotic behavior
Edit: Now that I think about it I've never met someone who approves of the attacks."
10366,I,N,T,J,Huh. Looks kinda like Diego from The Umbrella Academy
10367,I,N,T,J,I love this!
10368,I,N,T,J,"thank you, could you please tell me why you think everyone should read it?"
10369,I,N,T,J,That's what happens to kids with strict parents
10370,I,N,T,J,"Thank you and that last part is really reassuring. That makes me feel better because the client made it seem like checking to make sure was a bad thing, but it wasn’t supposed to be. It just made me feel bad because we agreed as a team to ask the question and because I asked it the client seemed to think that I asked it and came up with it on my own."
10371,I,N,T,J,"Thanks. I’m trying to put that way of thinking in my head. I sure hope they’ll move on and forget about it, but it still sucks that it happened."
10372,I,N,T,J,"🥺 Whoa, thank you so much. You sound like a wise person and I really appreciate your advice~"
10373,I,N,T,J,"Exactly. So that’s why I held and am holding on to my pride. I wasn’t going to bother him knowing that he was giving mixed signals. That’s why I described him as a curse...his charm spell hasn’t worn off yet, but I refuse to let him know that—but I still miss him...damn it."
10374,I,N,T,J,"Well it’s not my fault. The ENTP said that he wanted time apart, so I gave him his time. I decided that I needed that time apart too because I was getting way too attached and I couldn’t tell if he was serious about me so I had to learn to be okay without speaking to him—but after two weeks of not talking to the person I enjoyed talking to the most I couldn’t take it. I even convinced myself to fall for an ENFP that I don’t actually like to suppress my feelings—I hate it. Look, I have a plan at the end of November so it’s ok...hopefully~ Anyway, it’s not stupid, my heart is damaged bro, I’m trying my best"
10375,I,N,T,J,Thanks~ :)
10376,I,N,T,J,"Well, I’m going to tough it out until the end of November because I think that will be best—we can catch up then if he wants

and I agree he probably doesn’t know how to act, but then again he plays with my emotions sometimes and I need this break that we’re having but two weeks into it, I missed him so much and now we’re a whole month + into it"
10377,I,N,T,J,"I’m pretty sure he’s aware—we uh talked about it, but aren’t talking right now and I don’t plan on speaking to him until the end of November—i just haven’t spoken to him in a while"
10378,I,N,T,J,"Happy cake day and yes, yes you do~"
10379,I,N,T,J,"Nah, why I would hurt the one who I obviously have feelings for? That would bum me out honestly~"
10380,I,N,T,J,"As I said, I’d rather drown. :/"
10381,I,N,T,J,"It’s possible, but I won’t admit that~"
10382,I,N,T,J,"Ah, nice to know you have taste in anime though—good for you~"
10383,I,N,T,J,Aren’t you the dude who told me to use the WTFC code at checkout? 😬
10384,I,N,T,J,"Chicken poutine? :o Now that sounds delicious, I’m going to look it up~ 😆"
10385,I,N,T,J,"Sure, it is basically where you make French fries and you top it with your style of seasoned chicken and cheese with maybe a few other things of your choosing~ It’s really tasty!"
10386,I,N,T,J,I’d pay to eat this~ So delicious looking!
10387,I,N,T,J,"Ah, so you obviously don’t understand what random thoughts are—good to know~"
10388,I,N,T,J,I remember someone roasted a watermelon and it looked like this so I was a bit suspicious~ Glad to know it’s actually ham~
10389,I,N,T,J,Is that a real code? For which food app?
10390,I,N,T,J,I believe so lol
10391,I,N,T,J,I’d have to say that I agree~
10392,I,N,T,J,"Sure, I thought the same but then after a while there was no reason to manipulate and even when I was trying to put defenses up by being cold they still wanted to be a huge sun. Idk for me, my ENFP proved to me that I could at least let them into the lobby."
10393,I,N,T,J,How very INTJ of you~
10394,I,N,T,J,I like the ENFP and I don’t think being hurt is something I need to fear at the moment~ :)
10395,I,N,T,J,Just reading your comments are refreshing and they make me smile. I thank all of you ENFPs for existing~ :)
10396,I,N,T,J,"For sure, they’re super chill and also giggly~ If you need someone to laugh at your jokes, once again, get you an ENFP lol"
10397,I,N,T,J,"I’ve had my time with INTPs, we don’t mesh apparently—I prefer the extroverted folk, they’re more fun~"
10398,I,N,T,J,"Yeah, so I wish you luck on finding your ENFP friend~ Have a good one~"
10399,I,N,T,J,"Depends on if you want them to, for me my ENFP will listen to me and my plans to save the world for as long as I want to talk about it and then he’ll smile and say “I understand” and then if I ask a question he’ll tell a detailed story that relates to the topic of conversation~"
10400,I,N,T,J,Then get you an ENFP m8~
10401,I,N,T,J,"Yeah, but they’re harmless magical people and they use their magic to make cotton candy clouds and yellow brick roads pretty much~"
10402,I,N,T,J,"Lol At this point I don’t think I need to, he’s found a way to get in with or without my help~ ENFPs are lowkey magical people~"
10403,I,N,T,J,"He’s not in all the way yet, but he’s halfway through the bars~"
10404,I,N,T,J,.
10405,I,N,T,J,I probably won’t~
10406,I,N,T,J,Posts like these are why I joined this sub~
10407,I,N,T,J,This feels nice~ 😌
10408,I,N,T,J,😌🙏🏽
10409,I,N,T,J,Cheesecake is my weakness~ 🤍
10410,I,N,T,J,Please continue to be an amazing person! 😌
10411,I,N,T,J,Gimme! 🥺🤍
10412,I,N,T,J,"Yes, and they’re even better from your favorite people."
10413,I,N,T,J,"Hey man, you had me at chill~ No need to be a poet~"
10414,I,N,T,J,That really was satisfying~
10415,I,N,T,J,Mannn the abrupt charge with the caption took me out~
10416,I,N,T,J,So wholesome kind sir~ 😌 Thank you for brightening my day with your smile!
10417,I,N,T,J,This is one of the best hacks I’ve seen. Now I want to make tacos just to use this hack~
10418,I,N,T,J,"I don’t know much about the ISTP, but everyone seems to accept him, so maybe I should learn a little more~"
10419,I,N,T,J,That one next to the first at the bottom left looks definitely like a fried chicken leg with glaze. :>
10420,I,N,T,J,I did (and still am) doing pretty well in school. Excelled in the arts and sciences. My brother who is also an INTJ does extremely well in school too.
10421,I,N,T,J,"Cancer sun, Pisces moon, Cancer rising, Venus and mercury. 

I can see this being true."
10422,I,N,T,J,take 2-10 bridge in Lake Charles or go around the I-10 bridge through Westlake.
10423,I,N,T,J,Let's goooo!!!!!
10424,I,N,T,J,"Be aware of social peer pressure even if it doesn't seem overt, it can be easy for some students to get caught up in idle behavior especially in the first years. Find your niche, find friends who allow you to be yourself, especially those who share the same drive as you and can help motivate you to do right. Save money even if it is small amounts, pay attention to due dates, read ahead, make use of the library, both public and college libraries. Stay cool with professors (you never know who you will need for letters or recommendations in the future). Take advantage of tutoring even if you think you're doing okay in a class, anything helps. Take care to eat well and exercise, it greatly affects mental health. Good physical and mental health can help you manage stress. Set a daily routine and stick with it best you can. And lastly, don't pull all-nighters, it never actually works in the end. (These are all based on my experiences and what I could think of at the moment!)"
10425,I,N,T,J,Acne allowed me to find my interest in dermatology. I am more aware of my skin in general and how to care for it. There is the good and bad in everything.
10426,I,N,T,J,"Focus on the GED. Don't feel the need to rush college, try your best to do everything diligently and complete that GED before moving on the college."
10427,I,N,T,J,im all for this
10428,I,N,T,J,I am triggerrreddd lmfao
10429,I,N,T,J,"No, because I like to learn from those who know more than me. I like to ask questions and inquire about a person's wisdom/life experiences. Like another comment said, if I'm the smartest in the room, I'm in the wrong room."
10430,I,N,T,J,"You're not stupid, don't tell yourself that. I went through the same thing. I didn't take scholarships seriously at first in high school so I completely understand the feeling but understand that you yourself are not your mistakes. You got this. Things will come around as long as you put the work in and believe that it can happen. I don't know you but I have faith in you!"
10431,I,N,T,J,LMAO
10432,I,N,T,J,"I personally don't believe in exfoliating the lips due to the very thin layer of skin our lips have, vaseline acts as an insoluble barrier that allows the skin to heal underneath and it helps seal in any moisture to combat dryness. My lips look healthy an soft when I treat it with vaseline and drink plenty water."
10433,I,N,T,J,"I was just about to type the same thing: Vaseline. 

I keep the little lip-care jar of it everywhere, applying when needed. Helps heal the chapped, dry lips."
10434,I,N,T,J,"I won't even look at my phone for hours on end sometimes, they think I'm lying when I say ""I wasn't on my phone"" but I will have it on my desk untouched."
10435,I,N,T,J,"I do it so much, but I will sometimes feel guilty because I do care about those people I just don't feel like texting everyday. Especially replying fast; unless its dire, its not necessary. Don't rush me to text back."
10436,I,N,T,J,my mom? (an ISFJ) STRESSED. Thats all I can say.
10437,I,N,T,J,"this is really pretty, beautiful even"
10438,I,N,T,J,this is the one! my mom says this all the time (she's an ISFJ)
10439,I,N,T,J,"I would bet he was having an off day especially if he turned back to normal later. It's good that he even texted you back, I typically won't text back if I'm having a rough time, so I will stay to myself. He must like you imo. He'll probably let you know what happened in his own time."
10440,I,N,T,J,"I can tell what sign the moon is in based off my behavior and mood (cheesy, I know), its one of the most important things I look at on the astrological forecast because it affects me so much emotionally and mentally. Most people should look into how the moon affects them, I agree it can be overlooked. 

I'm a Cancer sun/rising/mercury/venus with a pisces moon btw."
10441,I,N,T,J,"I'm an INFJ, according to this theory I would be an INFP. 

Really don't think my Mars in Libra would be in the perceiving category imo"
10442,I,N,T,J,this further proves my 5w4 mindset lmfao
10443,I,N,T,J,"sitckwitittttt, I know how you feel. It'll come out of nowhere, just push through"
10444,I,N,T,J,"no, you are considerate. I live with an immunocompromised person too and I'd rather take the L of not hanging out with people than compromise my brother's health. People are ridiculous."
10445,I,N,T,J,hell yes
10446,I,N,T,J,super compliments! I do this but never gave it a name lol
10447,I,N,T,J,"I was mistyped as an INFP once (I knew for sure it wasn't right) and INTJ majority of the time. I actually thought I could've been one until I was finally typed as an INFJ. I resonated with INTJ  (but didn't relate to the ""cold/analytical"" stereotype at all) until I saw that INFJ fit me to a T. My younger brother is an INTJ and I always say I'm similar to him but with actual feelings lol."
10448,I,N,T,J,looking amazing!
10449,I,N,T,J,"I would def try a benzoyl peroxide wash (5% wash helps keep my cystic acne at bay) it takes a while to see results but it can help, and you will see a bout of irritation and dryness so be sure to keep using the moisturizers but def look into that. Accutane should be a last resort imo."
10450,I,N,T,J,"Oh and ""Orange"" since you like fruits basket"
10451,I,N,T,J,"Gintama if you haven't seen it already, its god-tier and has plenty episodes without ""fillers"" that feel like ""fillers"""
10452,I,N,T,J,no problem I just remembered because I share the same birthday and I just recently saw the episode where he celebrated *on his own* lol
10453,I,N,T,J,It's on June 26th...
10454,I,N,T,J,"Very rough, I can only remember one teacher that really paid attention to what I was struggling with and sat down with me to work on it. I believe she was the reason why my parents started to look into Dyslexia/ADD. Most teachers throughout my years just wrote that my errors were ""silly mistakes"" on tests/assignments and that did nothing for my self-esteem and it did not help me get better in whatever it was that I was having errors in. More awareness in classrooms and teaching teachers how to address students with LD's"
10455,I,N,T,J,I got glasses in 3rd grade but it was due to dyslexia and not vision impairment. So sorta kinda lol
10456,I,N,T,J,"yeah you're right, thanks lol"
10457,I,N,T,J,"the test I took gives you a ""type"" in percentages because it explained the nuance of giving someone a definite label. So out of all enneagram types, I scored 5w4 the highest, the second highest was 5w8. Let me know if that makes any sense."
10458,I,N,T,J,"I'm typed as an INFJ and my primary score was 5w4 and the secondary score was 5w8. 

So yeah, most definitely"
10459,I,N,T,J,"Most definitely, it's pretty known amongst my friends and family that I do not reach out as often as the average person probably would. But they are okay with it because they know I'm not **truly** ghosting them. I feel like it's primarily the disconnect of tech/devices for me, I don't like talking on the phone or texting unless its important. The close friends that I do manage to text, I send them long texts about a certain in-depth topic every 3-4 hours during a span of one day, never really ""chatting"". I'd rather talk in person one-on-one than through distance contact, so I try to meet up but sometimes I'll make a conscious effort to reach out.  My friends understand that it's in my nature to be this way without being upset about it, that's why I make an effort to keep in touch because I truly appreciate that they stick around, not too many people will be cool with this aspect of INFJs or introverts in general. 

He most likely cares. My advice to him would be to send a text every now and then and to make somewhat of an effort to keep in the mix as much as comfortably possible."
10460,I,N,T,J,"(from me to you, a fellow **astro ho**)

I'm an INFJ-T (5w4 enneagram if that helps)

rising: Cancer 1st house

sun: Cancer 12th house

moon: Pisces 9th house

mercury: Cancer 12th house

venus: Cancer 1st house

mars: Libra 3rd house

jupiter: Aquarius 8th house

saturn: Aries 10th house

uranus: Aquarius 7th house

I personally feel like my astrology chart and MBTI type correlate pretty well."
10461,I,N,T,P,"There are some naturals but it’s a learned skill for most of us. It’s likely you just need more practice and someone to advise you on what to improve on, or maybe you don’t prepare effectively. I’m sure there’s a public speaking class at your school if you’re interested."
10462,I,N,T,P,this was surprisingly convincing
10463,I,N,T,P,Looks like shrek’s ear wax
10464,I,N,T,P,Huh. I didnt have a problem getting an appointment but I did sit in the crowded waiting room for two hours waiting to get tested so unless theyve changed their game I dont think your experience is the norm
10465,I,N,T,P,Tested monday near the end of the day. results thursday morning
10466,I,N,T,P,his shield is dory lol
10467,I,N,T,P,"No, that’s the number. I called at 9:30 ish this morning and they got me in same day. So I guess tomorrow just try calling in the morning. probably less busy."
10468,I,N,T,P,holy shit dude how many dashes are you gonna use
10469,I,N,T,P,"Start programming assignments EARLY! Seriously. Don’t be that guy complaining about how the assignment is too long the day before it’s due. Also, google is your friend. At least do a cursory search and try to figure something out for yourself before turning to help. Nothing is more annoying than someone asking me a question that they could have easily found the answer to themselves if they tried. I googled it, so you can too. 

Don’t be discouraged by people who seem all high and mighty trying to flaunt their cs knowledge. I’ve overheard many people shit talking other people’s solutions when theirs is also not so great so just take them with a grain of salt and focus on your learning. 

Also learn how to use git and keep a backup of your stuff in the cloud."
10470,I,N,T,P,2nd and 3rd are both fairy tail
10471,I,N,T,P,Fairy tail final series
10472,I,N,T,P,that episode was bomb
10473,I,N,T,P,Withdraw. I always fumble it
10474,I,N,T,P,Assassination Classroom is actually about middle schoolers
10475,I,N,T,P,Because you’re spelling it wrong
10476,I,N,T,P,If you’re watching on netflix season 1 is 24 episodes and 120 on MAL. Season 2 is 24 on both. Season 3 is 2 episodes on netflix but 1 on MAL: https://myanimelist.net/anime/38249/Saiki_Kusuo_no_Ψ-nan__Kanketsu-hen
10477,I,N,T,P,"https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1725388

Basically the 24 full episodes are a compiled version of 120 mini episodes"
10478,I,N,T,P,I’m okay with it sometimes. But if they can’t respect when I want some space then I’ll just grow completely detached from them in order to get it
10479,I,N,T,P,{Grand blue}
10480,I,N,T,P,The guy saiki admires for being completely average at everything he does. Plain asf so i wont describe his appearance. he didnt show up a whole lot
10481,I,N,T,P,"This was quite the confusing read. the only thing I really got from this is that it sounds like he’s a dick to you and possibly has some mental health issues going on. but Being intp is NOT an excuse for being an asshole, especially to ur SO. It sounds like he needs a wake up call that he’s a dick and probably therapy. I’m not good with this stuff but I honestly don’t see how anything you could possibly do would help him if he doesnt want to be helped himself. and it sounds like if you do stick around and try to help him you’ll most definitely get hurt

idk. that probably wasnt helpful but those are my thoughts on the matter"
10482,I,N,T,P,Haha this is kind of how I feel when Im healing. I have to make a conscious effort to not apologize when someone dies even if it wasnt my fault and they were just bein a dumdum bc I feel like i failed my job if that happens
10483,I,N,T,P,It sounds like you’re doing it right. You search google and learn as you go. The only other thing to do is knowing when to ask someone with more experience or knowledge on that topic than you. People are also a valid resource
10484,I,N,T,P,This is great! I love the soft colors
10485,I,N,T,P,The general consensus is golding weapons has an impact on dps but golding anything else isnt really necessary
10486,I,N,T,P,What round was the hardest for you? I got to rink of frozen blood but havent actually attempted it on vet yet bc it was the worst round for me on normal and im not looking forward to it
10487,I,N,T,P,I second the rubber duck method. I’d always start talking about a problem im struggling to solve to my non cs roommate and almost every time it’s like a light bulb went off. She didn’t even have to say a word
10488,I,N,T,P,F
10489,I,N,T,P,That’s called a scam. Not even a good one
10490,I,N,T,P,I didn’t think you could see other peoples damage with that? Only yours and the whole groups. Unless you mean have all the rest of the group post theirs
10491,I,N,T,P,The answer is downvote bc I’ve seen this post about 20 times in the past week
10492,I,N,T,P,Well if they said you could force add then I think you can probably (hopefully) trust them on that. But otherwise yeah use course pickle and dont forget to do conditional add drop so you dont lose the class altogether but if youre committed to being all remote ig that doesnt matter too much
10493,I,N,T,P,wait So Malestrom weapons drop in normal now? (and perfected in vet?) I tried to google it but im on my phone and the first pages to come up didnt look like they were updated and all said dropped from vet
10494,I,N,T,P,it was mentioned that she had a perfect track record in the gambling dens so celeste I suppose
10495,I,N,T,P,I was hoping it’d be enders game and I feel validated that it was lol. One of my fave books
10496,I,N,T,P,I had that exact setup except flipped and it fit. There was one room that even managed to fit both beds on one wall. Not rlly sure how though cuz it didnt work for us when we tried but they certainly figured it out
10497,I,N,T,P,Nah the bathroom isnt bad. The stairwell door closing can be pretty loud though but honestly I was never super bothered by it. The worst spot in any dorm is being next to people who are loud asf and you have no way of knowing that till you get there so dont sweat it
10498,I,N,T,P,You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies?
10499,I,N,T,P,Who’s winnin? Celeste or Yumeko?
10500,I,N,T,P,"Just checked. Apparently all of mine are online too.... I was kinda expecting it but idk how I feel
about it"
10501,I,N,T,P,Just look up minstrel shows. That’s where it originated. I hope the rest is self explanatory
10502,I,N,T,P,college kid majoring in comp sci. Also minoring in math and chem but thats only bc I ended up switching from chemical engineering and had all the credits for them already
10503,I,N,T,P,NTA. I like anime but this is wayyyyyyy too cringe for me. You probably should have just not given them any answers to begin with instead of the wrong ones but it doesn’t even seem like they cared that they failed so whatevs. They shouldn’t have even put you in that position to begin with so I won’t condemn you for it. They didnt deserve to pass if they werent doing any work
10504,I,N,T,P,Looks like the dreadhorn body tattoo
10505,I,N,T,P,"Yeahhh. I’ve been getting into battlegrounds recently so I’ve never experienced being able to queue into it as a group. That being said, the other day I queued up at the same time as my brother and we managed to get into the same team. (we tried this a few times before but never even managed to get into the same game, let alone the same group)

It was waaayyyy more fun. And now that I know what I’m missing out on I’m annoyed they took away the option to queue with a group. If they’re worried about certain teams dominating just make it so grouped teams only play against other groups"
10506,I,N,T,P,Same. even if its a vet dungeon that might actually be easier with 3dps 1healer/tank or whatever. Its more of a principle thing for me. if you want to do that find your own group instead of queueing
10507,I,N,T,P,Is cadwell a vestige? (and hence thats why he stays sane as a soul shriven)
10508,I,N,T,P,you may pet it..... once
10509,I,N,T,P,My first character was a magDK and I remember struggling super hard when I was questing trying to level up. (Probably had a lot to do with being a complete noob to eso tho) Ive mained them ever since and PvE is fine. If you PvP just be warned magDKs have terrible mobility tho. They also lack an execute but have stuns and ccs
10510,I,N,T,P,"“i think people should just exercise to the degree you’re not wasting your genetic potential”

I think you’re underestimating how much exercising it would take to reach your full physical potential. I’m no expert, but im pretty sure it’s a lot more than a half hour a day. Tho I don’t really understand the whole wasting potential point of view in the first place"
10511,E,N,F,P,"Thank you very much for your adivce! I am sorry for you that you have gone through the same but I really hope, you are better now! 

> These activities reconnect me with myself and help me remember that I do not need to constantly make everyone happy or perform for everyone. They remind me that it is ok for me to feel unhappy and it is ok for life not to be perfect. I can be a little messy and still have some order. That is just life as an ENFP. We get the best of both worlds. The logic and the feels. The introvert and the extrovert. The order and the chaos. We just have a hard time accepting that. So that is our mission... finding balance. That comes with time and personal growth 

I really like the way you discribed us and you made me really proud to be an ENFP. Because I have reason to be! Thank you so much again and I really apprechiate the time you took to write this! 😊💕

Now that I have an idea about what is wrong, I can start working on improving my condition"

10515,E,N,F,P,"Thank you a lot! I already thought about this but for me it felt like my Fi was okay and my Ne was the one lacking. But now that you sax it, you might be right.
Nowadays I ""don't have time"" to journal and to really focus on me. I am somehow procrastinating the self reflection part.
So thank you very much! 😊"
10516,E,N,F,P,Thank you for your nice words 😊😊 and it is good to know that not only I feel this way ♡

10518,E,N,F,P,Thank you very much for this piece of art!!! :)
10519,E,N,F,P,ahh the overeating with inferior sensing... truly horrible
10520,E,N,F,P,this summarizes my reaction
10521,E,N,F,P,"I know I am not intj and so but obviously it is not your fault how things turned. I may not know the reasons behind why she dumped you this abrupt but I think this is not how she should have done it! I am so sorry to hear how things turned out, especially after you seemed to like her so much. 

I really do hope this is not a trait many ENFPs or people in general have. There are immature ENFPs which tend to be very enthusiastic about meeting new people but loose their interest fast, but as far as I am concerned, ENFPs in general are considerate of the othere people´s feelings and needs and do not dumb people like that. But despite any type preference, I guess, there will always be exeptions within a type. 

This is so understandable that you feel like shit now and I with there would be anything to make you feel better about this but I am afraid there is not much I can say other than that you have not done anything wrong. She could have choosen to be mature and to discuss things with you and what you could improve (if there is something she wanted you to change) or just telling you, that she feels like she needs some free time to reflect or so. She cannot expect you to know whats on, when she is not telling you, and then just leave you like this."
10522,E,N,F,P,(but here is a hug for you \*hug\*)

10536,E,N,F,P,"I 100% agree with you! I think that a way to receive information and to make desicions doesnt makes us better or worse. As far as I am concerned, we cannot even choose which Type we will be, so I feel like feeling superior due a thing, which you could not change anything about is kinda pathetic. I surely wont define myself by being an ENFP, there is more to me that my way of working with information. And so it is with EVERy other person. The things you cannot change anything about are not defining you. YOU are choosing who you will be, not fate..

So yes. I think that acting like something better due to some traits one cannot influence is very pathetic. I can understand that Sensors may think they can communicate better with sensors and vice versa with Intuitives. But MBTI does **not** extist to seperate people. Everyone has special and individual and unique strenghts, weaknesses and traits. There is no reason for anybody to be worth less due to something other than their action"

10549,E,N,F,P,"Yes, exactly same here. I am also totally biased, thats part of why I wanted to know what others think ahah"
10550,E,N,F,P,"I see it exactly the same way as you! I think this roleplay/stereotype is somehow funny but some people are so obsessed with sterotypes, like where is the REAL you, beside from MBTI??

The thing I have been thinking about a lot is, that we cannot decide what Mbti we get (as far as I am conerned) but why should we act like a role given us by faith. Our Mbti type doesn´t define us. There is a lot more than this. I am not saying that MBTI is not somehow helpful your it is not good to know there are people thinking the same way as you, it is great to know that there are other people! But my Type as ENFP doesn´t define me, some personality, I just got and could not influence, wont decide who I am. I will decide this myself, I will decide how I will be, not a label will do so.

Like, ENFP is not equivalent with my personality. I would say a part of my personality includes being ENFP"

10555,E,N,F,P,"Oh yes me too! i thought I was introverted for a long time. But there were some thing seperating me from introverts for example, now that I am thinking about it. 

In class when there was a circle of kids and talking about something funny, I wanted to join and to see whats happening with all the people. I wanted to be included in the actvities of society, while my introverted were like 0% interested what they were doing and I always was so confused why they didn´t want to spend time with the others haha. But yes I was a very shy kid and I still would cosider me rather shy. But I am also very exited when meeting new people"
10556,E,N,F,P,OMG this looks wonderful!!!!
10557,E,N,F,P,i love him
10558,E,N,F,P,"I feel like that the situation with Valentine and the Circle greatly remembers me of Hitler and the Nazis. Hitler was so good in winning the trust of the germans and discriminate the jews, which also was a product of the Germans to feel closer as a group. He made he Germans feel important and special, because they were ""choosen"" germans. I also thought this was a lot like Valentine did this. He picked lonley shadowhunters and gave them a purpuse with joining the cirlce. (a side note ahahaha)

 So I would say jes, some shadowhunters treat the downworlders very bad due their ""races""."

Military. This is mixed one and obviously opinions and politics and such come into the decision BUT the Marines provided my father a job out of high school when he didn’t have much else. I had lots of friends go into the reserve or active duty in the Army and National Guard. There are benefits and many around family. I did have a college degree but when I graduated it was real tough to find a job. I almost joined the Air Force. I ended up getting a civilian job, but the military was what I looked to as “well, if there’s nothing else.

My step-dad is a truck driver. He started out doing beer deliveries (yes, he’s heard every joke). And eventually moved to semis. It’s rough on your body to be driving that much but it’s very solid work.

Silicon makes transistors, transistors make half-adders and adders and OR/AND/NAND/XOR gates. So you can add and do logic. From there you can subtract and multiply.

You could build all that with physical, hand-thrown switches and lights, but transistors turn physically flipping a switch into just needing to send it voltage. Then the output of that transistor can flip another transistor and so on.

The combination of these transistors can be combined into well-known circuits (like half-adder), which themselves can be combined into larger circuits and so on.

Going into analogy mode: Those are the boards and nails. Eventually you build houses out of them, from those houses you end up with neighborhoods, and eventually cities. But unlike cities, circuits and chips get physically smaller and smaller, not larger.

""CODE: the hidden language of computer hardware and software"" is probably the most-recommended book on this ""bottom-up"" type of understanding. Very approachable and assumes nothing.

You can have interests, be attractive, and healthy AND be smart. 

In fact, I’d say that the “A” level people in any field are the ones who find balance and meaning in all parts of their life. They excel because of that balance, not in spite of it.  It’s the “B” and “C” level people that think they HAVE to sacrifice being a human being to produce code or whatever.

10701,I,N,T,J,"Java is good where the JVM is good. As in programs that will run for a long time and need to be fast and where the programmers don’t want to deal directly with pointers. 

The main areas are backend services and Android. Backend services are a fit for Java because of its speed (and its where startup speed doesn’t really matter much) and because Java is an enterprise level language. This means it has a standard library, frameworks, and third-party libraries and SDKs galore to support building such services. The JVM allows for a developer to be able to use the exact same artifacts for a service on their laptop as is used on a server using whatever OS and whatever specs and expect equivalent behavior. 

Main contenders in this space are Rails and PHP (for web pages); Go and Python and Node.js (for services). Most can’t give the “natural” speed without tuning that Java can, other than Go and it’s kind of late to the party."

10704,I,N,T,J,"First, I empathize. I really do. It was **nowhere** near as bad, but I graduated at the end of the 2008 recession (though at the time we didn't know it was the end of it).

When I first went into college, graduates were deciding between half a dozen great offers. By the time I got out, half of my peers weren't getting any offers. The best of us managed to squeeze out one each.

I couldn't pay for grad school (or wouldn't, the ROI is terrible), and was applying everywhere I could with no answers. My parents are old-school; there's no moving back. So I had to look at every option.

I decided to join the Air Force as a commissioned officer. It was not my original plan at all, but I was not going to be homeless or get trapped in the min-wage cycle (where you can only get min-wage jobs because that's all you've worked in). I was gonna go the whole way. Even went to have the full physical taken. Then at the last moment, I got an interview for a govt contractor. I ended up taking the interview, got a job, and it's been up from there.

This stuff is not 99% action and 1% luck. Whatever the proportion is, we don't fucking know or we'd be betting on it.

10710,I,N,T,J,"I mean this in as nice of a way as I can: Your writing reads like half-baked drugged up ravings. Maybe take a nap and come back after reading more about how a browser works. Hell, you can browse the source of several browsers out there.

Browsers provide caching, a JS VM, interaction with the underlying OS (for file uploads and such), HTML and CSS displaying, security, accessibility and much much more. 

Take a look at the OSI layers. ""The browser"" (btw there isn't just one) sits at the application layer. HTTP is the application protocol. By having a common protocol, you can have a consistent experience for a webpage regardless of OS, device type, etc.

You can't replace HTTP with FTP. They're on different axis, or ports to be exact. 

>  In my view, internet resources that you would use most frequently could be more like native apps, involving more downloading and as such using a different protocol perhaps, whereas internet resources that you might view/use only once would have a more immediate, temporary existence using less memory (ie. in a similar way to a web page transmitted by HTTP).

That's exactly where apps and web pages come in."

I'll patiently let them say what they want to say, waiting for the right moment to come in and direct the conversation to where it should have been going in the first place, and then another guy will step in, say the exact same stuff I said at the beginning, but get the results I was looking for. it's beyond infuriating."

10865,I,N,T,J,"I was a Guild fan back when new episodes were still coming out, immediately watched G&S on YouTube, and then made the switch to Twitch early on as well. Critical Role really locked me into Twitch, but I have watched and continue to watch lots of other G&S shows. Community was always the most important thing, and I felt it all throughout those years. 

But over time, especially recently, I've noticed things change: production quality, community, openness, etc. So seeing the continued exodus of G&S people merely confirms what I've feared all along: that LDN and Alpha are fucking everything up for G&S. And now that Nerdist announced today that they're leaving Twitch to be only on FB, YT, and Alpha (which I think is such a bad idea), I'm really scared to see where LDN takes G&S from here. 

I'll remain a Twitch sub to support Critical Role since I know they have a different contract in place, but otherwise, my money's going to HyperRPG. #TeamHooman"

10873,I,N,T,J,"I usually feel like this subreddit isn't that negative, and I completely agree that discussion is not inherently bad. in fact, I'm normally one of the people saying that we should all chill out and not vilify anyone for expressing unpopular opinions. but in this case, I saw people in this thread and the live thread who went beyond discussion and made it personal. there were many posts accusing Laura of purposely forgetting about her exhaustion penalty, and a lot of other people were saying that Laura was being a bad player by stealing from another player.

you're right that there were also plenty of posts discussing D&D etiquette, and those posters successfully stated their opinion without making it personal. but in this instance, the number of people making it personal and even mean were too high. additionally, that ratio has shifted since last night. the reaction started off as negative but has since calmed down."
10874,I,N,T,J,"+1 to all of this. Laura absolutely doesn't deserve the backlash she's getting for her valid RP choices, especially the accusations of purposely forgetting about exhaustion. and I'm sorry, Matt, that you felt the need to clarify all of this. but I admittedly find your thoughts really interesting.

when watching the stream, I happened to feel the same way about the broom. Vex has wanted to make flight a thing for quite some time now, and it was clear that she wanted the broom the moment she saw it. that makes a lot of RP sense to me.

also, some people have complained that Vex hasn't learned her lesson about greed yet. assuming that her near death experiences have stemmed from greed, why would we assume that a character would immediately stop acting that way? people don't always learn their lesson when they should, so that's well within the bounds of good RP to me. is it frustrating? sure. but it's realistic.

I think the alignment shift is interesting. I don't think it had to happen based on her actions because I see alignment shifts as a big deal that really only the DM can manage, but it certainly seems consistent. I'm very excited to see how that plays out in the future and am all for some more Vex character development. "

10876,I,N,T,J,"I agree with you. I have no problem with Draconian Knights content being posted here, but there should also be a separate sub to discuss it. someone mentioned below listing that sub as a sister sub or something, that way both subs can be linked, and I like that idea as a lot of the Draconian Knights are also Critters."
10877,I,N,T,J,"I was raised in a similar environment, so I also feel uncomfortable for the exact same reason"
10878,I,N,T,J,"agreed. Episode 43 is now my favorite episode, hands down."
10879,I,N,T,J,"and now that Scanlan is a more balanced, not-quite-as-snarky person thanks to his daughter, I found it really refreshing to have a character in the mix with a darker, sarcastic personality. he's like a sassier, less broody version of Vax haha"
10880,I,N,T,J,+1 to Will being a regular member. I also nominate Mary for that.
10881,I,N,T,J,I didn't know that happened either or that it got that bad for Marisha... =(
10882,I,N,T,J,"> I see a divide, I just don't think it matters so much that the community is divided into different camps. I think it matters how those camps try to get their points across.

*really* good point"
10883,I,N,T,J,"hmm, good point... then maybe that means the community is already divided, in a sense, between here, Twitch, and Twitter"
10884,I,N,T,J,"There are a couple reasons to talk about rules. First, some people just like them. From reading through this subreddit, for instance, there have been a lot of great mechanics discussions that get pretty granular sometimes. And those discussions happen because it interests people/makes them happy. Even Matt jumps in on those sometimes. Second, Matt specifically resonates with a lot of new DMs who are newly inspired to emulate him and learn from him. So there are lots of people who do look up the rules or don't know the rules/don't have access to them and then want to discuss them. For instance, I'm not a DM, but I'm new to D&D. After I looked up the rules, I was discussing it with some friends on gchat and then reading chat to get more info on the details. And it was really helpful to me.

You're definitely right about not accounting for people PMing Matt though. I didn't even think of that."
10885,I,N,T,J,"Twitch chat wasn't bad either. There were some people who wrongly assumed that Matt misread the rules and were upset about it, and there were also some people who wrongly assumed that Matt misread the rules and then called people stupid for discussing it. But most people just wanted to discuss the rules, what they were, and how they worked. 

So I think your point about assigning value judgments is spot on. A lot of people posted the rules for those who were asking legitimate questions, and there was a strong response of ""HOW DARE YOU DISCUSS THIS, RULE-LAWYERS ARE THE WORST."" That level of self-righteousness in chat, most of which was coming from the people assuming that all discussion/questions had a value judgement attached to it, was far more toxic imo than the small amount of inappropriate comments.

That being said, I can't speak for Twitter because obviously it was bad enough to where Matt and Liam felt the need to comment, which really sucks."
10886,I,N,T,J,"But some people really do care about the numbers and about mechanics. Not everyone is into just the story.

I understand that there were some negative comments in Twitch chat, but most people were reacting out of surprise that the rules didn't work the way it's written in the PHB which then inspired people to ask about the rules and discuss them. There is nothing wrong with that so long as the comments are appropriate, and from what I saw, most of them were. 

Also note that the cast doesn't see Twitch chat. So I suspect that Matt and Liam felt the need to respond based on Twitter.

tl;dr Everyone enjoys CR differently, and so long as people are nice about it, then that's ok."
10887,I,N,T,J,so cool to read more about our mods #IsItThursdayYet #WhyYesItIs #OMGITSTHURSDAYYOUGUYS
10888,I,N,T,J,"IMO, it seems like the two of you don't know how to communicate with each other, and neither of you are aware of what kind of support the other person needs. 

I'm an INTJ female with lots of close INFJ friends and an INFJ ex, and I recognize a lot of what you're talking about. I'll address each anecdote you brought up in turn: 

* just from the title, I think you need to stop thinking that your friend is immature and needs an ah ha moment. you both need to understand each other better and to work on the relationship together.

* think over how she walks you through your emotions. it's possible that she really may think they're invalid (which wouldn't be cool), but it sounds like she's trying to help you work through the emotion and how to deal with it in a way that would help you. I'm guilty of doing this: walking an INFJ through their emotions and treating their emotions how I would treat my own emotions. and that doesn't work unless both parties want that and understand what it means. you guys don't seem to be at that level. so I'd talk to her about it and let her know how you feel when she does that and what would be more helpful for you.

* when you asked if she would offer to pick you up, I would've been really offended by that too. as an INTJ, my initial and emotional reaction would be that you were questioning my integrity and our friendship. it would feel aggressive to me. now, it also sounds like she could have managed her emotions better and checked in with you to see what you really meant by that question. but I get why she was offended. 

* I personally never had an ah ha moment because everyone's different. I find it easier to be thoughtful and compassionate with some people moreso than others because we understand each other better and know how to avoid misunderstandings. that's not a good thing to rely on or an excuse, I'm working on improving how I relate to all people, but it's true. ah ha moments crop up with each relationship at different times, but all of those moments take work, communication, and awareness. and I think the two of you are lacking in the communication department.

"
10889,I,N,T,J,they've talked about doing a shenanigans episode where they all fight each other. awakening Trinket and adding Trinket to the fight would perfect that scenario.
10890,I,N,T,J,"ah I see. sorry for misconstruing that, and I totally get your point. :)"
10891,I,N,T,J,"imo, knowing that Tiberius isn't with the party anymore because Orion has left the group for now would also count as a spoiler for me. but I appreciate the clarification. "
10892,I,N,T,J,"I'm sorry, but the idea that only people who are caught up with the show should read this subreddit is ridiculous. this subreddit has episode-specific spoiler warnings for a reason, which allows new viewers to be selective about what they read, and is a great way for new viewers to interact with other fans. that shouldn't be an exclusive right for those of us who are fully caught up (which I am, btw). "
10893,I,N,T,J,spoiler tag should be updated to the episode where Orion leaves because this is a pretty huge spoiler for people who haven't gotten that far yet
10894,I,N,T,J,"yeah, the spoiler tag needs to be adjusted for people who haven't gotten to the episode where Orion leaves because this is a pretty huge spoiler"
10895,I,N,T,J,omg Trinket v. Grog bear fight would be everything I've ever wanted
10896,I,N,T,J,"fav arc: Underdark. it felt like a really, really well designed dungeon crawler that still allowed for a lot of creativity on Vox Machina's part. and I also found the K'varn fight more satsifying imho than the Briarwood fight.

fav episode: Aramente to Pyrah. it was really cool to see a completely different story line for an episode and to see Keyleth leading things for a bit. the whole party dynamic was different, going to the elemental plane was awesome, and all in all it just felt like a breath of fresh air. very memorable for me."
10897,I,N,T,J,"maybe this is an overly simple, sentimental tattoo, but I think it'd be cool to literally have <3 as a tattoo written out in a cool, old-fashioned typewriter script. very G&S and lots of fondness attached to that.

and aside from the tat idea, millions of congratulations Zac. you'll be missed, but this new opportunity for you sounds really great, so I wish you nothing but the best. you've been instrumental in making G&S what we all know and love today, and I can't thank you enough for that. don't be a total stranger. #LessThanThree"
10898,I,N,T,J,"thanks for providing this guidance. as a lawyer who's also a fan, I've wanted to buy stuff from Redbubble but didn't want to buy anything that violated any copyrights/trademarks or undercut any official merch. so this is really helpful to know.

I also second the notion that there should be a more formalized policy at some point."
10899,I,N,T,J,I think Full Sync is equally as good as Caught Up or Binge Watched or Rage Watched or any other phrase one cares to use. it kinda reminds me of completing Assassin's Creed. haha so let's add it to the list!
10900,I,N,T,J,"dream choices: Stephen Colbert, Nathan Fillion, Amy Schumer, Tricia Helfer, Chris Hardwick, and Brandon Sanderson

possibly more realistic choices who are still dream choices: Sean Day9 Plott, Steve Blum, Troy Baker, Jennifer Hale, Mary McGlynn, and Will Friedle"
10901,I,N,T,J,I can't upvote this enough
10902,I,N,T,J,"whoa, I never thought about this before, but you're totally right that Delilah and Percy's lives heavily mirror each other. 

another detail to support your comment is that Percy likely would have taken a much darker path if he made his choices on his own, like Delilah did, without the help of the rest of Vox Machina. he could have been just as twisted and corrupted as Delilah ever was. *shudders*"
10903,I,N,T,J,"I think your examples above perfectly encapsulate the gap between the part of this subreddit that wants to analyze and critique the show vs. the people who don't:

> ""OMG. You should have hit him with this spell instead of that spell. It would have been so much more effective, you're stupid and don't know how to play D&D""

> ""This character would have never done this, you don't know how to roleplay your character.""

both of those quotes have two parts and share the same structure. the first part is a logical argument that doesn't necessarily equal the second, more negative and emotional statement. 

* positing that one kind of spell would've been a more effective approach is NOT the same as saying that you're stupid and don't know how to play D&D. 

* arguing that a character wouldn't have done something is NOT the same as saying that the player doesn't know how to play their character. 

one can point out that other strategies would've been more effective or that a player's action seemed inconsistent for their character without being a butthole. and while I think you're cognizant of that distinction, comments like your quote above don't make that distinction. that makes people who like to critique and analyze feel attacked even when they're being reasonable and expressing their thoughts without being a butthole and even when Matt Mercer expressly said that the cast likes it when the fans do that. that distinction is really important, and I think that, in addition to being sensitive about how we discuss this show, we also need to be sensitive how we discuss the direction of this subreddit.

TL;DR giving thoughtful analysis and/or critique of CR can be done without being a butthole, and we need to all stop conflating the buttholes with the nice people who like to analyze/critique unless you really do believe that no analysis or critique should happen at all."
10904,I,N,T,J,I really appreciate you explaining that because I think I much better understand your point now about wanting to be aware of and respect the fine line between what's constructive and what isn't. it actually reminds me of articles I've read on how to effectively negotiate and communicate in relationships.
10905,I,N,T,J,"I think that desire showed up when he got the second corruption point, and then Pike later removed that corruption point."
10906,I,N,T,J,"> Also, is Keyleth's name going to appear on the Pepperbox now, since she (potentially) denied the smoke demon(?) Silas' soul?

oh man, I didn't even think of the potential consequences for that!"
10907,I,N,T,J,"as Matt said in his response to this thread, there's definitely a difference between critique and negativity. the cast welcomes and even likes critique, but they don't like negativity. 

I'm not seeing you make a distinction between the two, and I would like to better understand your position because I admittedly love critiquing and analyzing things that interest me. you say: 

> I would ask in return that you do not strawman me as a ""let's never say anything that is a criticism"" type.

but then you say:

> The fact that they share their game with us is not an invitation to critique their decisions on how they play their characters.

so, what's the distinction that you'd like to make? because so far you're proving that you think critique and negativity are indeed the same thing."
10908,I,N,T,J,"First, I think the decision was a good one. The party knew that sacrifices were made for some dark purpose, they saw Lady Briarwood use her own blood to fuel the incantations, and there were tons of dead bodies everywhere that went limp once the small black orb appeared which signaled to the entire party that necromancy was likely at work. So it's logical to conclude that her blood or her death or both could somehow make things worse.

Second, I somewhat agree with you that it's hard to believe that Percy would show mercy, but I think this fight was an exception because of Cassandra (and Pike to a minor extent as Percy has shown greater control when she's around). He would show mercy if it meant possibly keeping his sister safe, and given all of the dangers I mentioned above re: the orb, I think that's why he was able to hold back.

Third, I'm not sure if you have to call for non-lethal damage before making the attack. But I think Matt would have corrected that error if he wanted to given the possible consequences of that decision, so I cede to the DM there.

Lastly, I think Scanlan and Grog appropriately held back for the same reasons I mentioned at the top. They also were a ways away from Lady Briarwood when Percy made that shot, so I think that even if Grog hadn't noticed any of that stuff, he would've sensed that the rest of his team wasn't attacking her for some reason by the time he saw her. "
10909,I,N,T,J,"I was really into Tiberius' backstory, but since that won't be pursued, I'd like to delve into Vex. as someone else mentioned, we don't know anything about her that isn't in the intro video. 

additionally, I don't think it's required for us to explore the twins together. remember that they separated for a while, Vax going into the city and Vex going into the woods. we know that Vex somehow acquired Trinket while in the woods, but I'm sure plenty of other things happened to her that we could explore without involving Vax. plus, Vax is doing lots and lots of cool things with his character right now to the point where I almost consider the Briarwood story line to be primarily about Percy but secondarily about Vax. so we don't need to focus on Vax and should instead focus on Vex."

10957,I,N,F,J,"So like basically he knows his fans are very loyal and won't subscribe depending on what friends he has so he doesn't care and just stays friends with anyone? But it still doesn't answer the question of why he would be friends with someone like that in the first place, I don't think Shane is a bad person at all so I can't rap my head around it, maybe he stays friends with bad people cos he's so obsessed with seeing only the good side of people and would feel guilty for not being friends with them cos they like Shane. I can understand that tbh, I'm like that, i only like seeing the good side of people and find it hard to be rude to people who like me even though I don't like them, I can't be stern with someone who is being nice with me and tell them I don't want to be associated with them, it's hard to let go of a bad person that has always shown you love and appreciation."
10958,I,N,F,J,Ayyy thanks dude

10970,I,N,F,J,I'm unsure. He apparently had brain cancer though
10971,I,N,F,J,"Perhaps my grandpa or my other grandma, but I can't talk to the grandpa without him telling my mom, and my other grandma may not be able to do as much as I'd like. She has a good doctor, she's going to go through treatment, I just think my mind is going crazy and thinking worst case."
10972,I,N,F,J,"That's what happens to me every damn time, makes me sick. I did speech and debate in high school and I find so many things wrong with the logic that is frustrating lol. I want it to be over soon. This mess can't last forever though. I have hope ^.^"
10973,I,N,F,J,"I just want to prevent those consequences from happening. My mom doesn't understand the possible harm. She has really good intentions and wants to help, but I know her method of helping may not help and may cause future issues. Yeah there are consequences. But I don't want someone innocent to be punished with possibly dying of cancer because there's someone that believes everything she reads on the internet."
10974,I,N,F,J,"That's what's so sketchy about it all. My grandma has a good doctor and has survived cancer before. It's highly unlikely I could attend an appointment, unfortunately. I may not be able to with college going on, and there's a whole bunch of things complicating it."
10975,I,N,F,J,"18. I don't want anyone to get hurt or get in trouble. My grandma isn't that old, only around like the mid-late 60's and is doing great for her age, considering she survived cancer 5 years ago. She'll most likely be able to make decisions for herself, but if she weren't able to supposedly, there's no doubt my mom would be second place."
10976,I,N,F,J,Worm dog medicine or hydroxy?
10977,I,N,F,J,"She's going to an actual doctor. My mom's not going to try and prevent treatment and is making it her choice, but she's definitely pressuring my grandma into doing it. Knowing my grandma, she'd believe my mom because mom started dragging her into Q too, plus she's trust anything my mom says regarding to that stuff."
10978,I,N,F,J,"Thank you so much for your input! My grandma survived cancer about 5 years ago, and looks like the damn thing is back for more. That makes me feel a lot more reassured that it won't seriously hurt her."

10991,I,N,F,J,"Many believers in God also believe that ghosts and spirits go hand n hand, so they kind of go together and can be the same thing. But the thing is, we're werewolves and vampires created as an actual belief system, or rather a fable? The things like the Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, ect. Religiond were created for people to wholeheartedly believe in and have a faith in a God. For werewolves and vampires, they're mainly stories of fiction used to entertain. Like how many people compare the Bible to Harry Potter. The analogy doesn't work there because while both may be fiction, the Bible was created to be truth, while Harry Potter was specifically created as a fictional story for entertainment.

10999,I,N,F,J,Marco is missing his freckles. Who the hell is this imposter.
11000,I,N,F,J,With air. Get your mind out of the gutter boi
11001,I,N,F,J,"Higurashi. You'll be confused as hell at first, but it will make sense."
11002,I,N,F,J,"But like, will the 11 year old actors be wearing skimpy clothes and twerking in the original movie? Because in the trailer and I'm the poster, the girls were still forced to dress and act like that when they're too young to be in that position. My issue is that they're allowing girls to play in a movie that they're too young to actually be in. The intentions of the movie are great, sure, I agree. But can't they go about it in a different way?"
11003,I,N,F,J,"Still technically attempted murder, and cities is still sexually exploiting 11 year old girls who are to young to be thrown in a role like that..."
11004,I,N,F,J,"Holy fuck that's way too far >.<. I don't get what parent would allow their child to be out in that spot! Sure, I get that it's good to spread awareness and stuff, but like, don't get actual girls involved in the shut you're trying to fight. Wrong media to use imo"
11005,I,N,F,J,"I think my main issue though is that the girls being casted are going to be doing, er, *that* and being involved in an environment, even though it's just acting, and I think they're too young to be put in that spot."
11006,I,N,F,J,Still sponsoring it
11007,I,N,F,J,Thank you for the assumption.
11008,I,N,F,J,"But it's different because it concerns minors. A child shouldn't be allowed to twerk in a skimpy outfit, I feel for the children in the casting more than anything. Plus having it for millions of viewers to see? Not justifiable.

I understand and agree on your censorship aspect. But I find that a film is the wrong kind of media because it would force a child to reinact everything. It's hardly possible execute it without putting a child in a spot they don't need to be in."
11009,I,N,F,J,Thanks!

11021,I,N,T,J,"I don’t know where I could even begin getting help. I don’t have any teachers that are particularly close to me, since none of them like me a lot because of my mediocre grades and lack of responsibility. especially during the whole pandemic thing this year, the only adults I have talked to are my parents and half siblings (my siblings don’t talk to me either and I’m not comfortable talking to them about my problems, as they’ve also gaslighted me in the past.)

I’m too scared to report my parents to the police. after all, they have never physically abused me and they also provide for me, so I feel really guilty talking badly about them so publicly, and for them to actually hear all my thoughts about them makes me so scared.

about the party, I thought it was only going to be me, my friend, her female cousin and her cousin’s friend (we were all the same age), but when I got there, some of her older male cousins had brought their friends, one of which was my abuser. I still feel guilty for what happened to me since I should have just not gone.

and I’m not aware of any institutions in my country that could help me. (I’m from brazil)"
11022,I,N,T,J,"my main problem is that my house is not a very welcoming and safe environment for mental health discussion. 

I’ve had many problems before, including eating disorders (bulimia and a non diagnosed restrictive ed), having panic attacks in school, isolating myself from family and friends, feeling extremely anxious when interacting with people, and self harm (cutting, pinching, abusing medicine) and I also believe I have adhd. and every single time I tried to talk to my parents to get help and take me to a professional, they would gaslight me and scream at me, saying I was being dramatic or just wanting attention. 

my father constantly gets mad at me for stupid reasons, he screams at me for basically a whole hour, and stops talking to me for days. he’s done that to me my whole life.

they’re also transphobic. when I was on sixth grade I was having trouble with my gender identity, and when I talked to them about it, they screamed at me and forced me to wear girly clothes and I’ve basically had no freedom to express myself through my appearance.

it’s been years since I ever dared to talk to them about any type of issues I had. at 14, I was drugged and raped by a 26yo man while on a “party” at my friend’s house and they have no idea. I don’t plan on telling it either.

at 15 (16 in less than 2 months), I’ve already attempted suicide 3 times (all by overdose) and have felt suicidal more times than I can count. they’re not even aware of it, as none of my attempts have worked.

my parents might not be evil monsters, but they’re definitely not good parents.

I’m not sure if that sort of trauma is able to cause DID, and I really wanted to get a doctor, unfortunately the internet is the only resource I have."
11023,I,N,T,J,"the only thing I feel physically is some dizziness, as it's basically a feeling of disorientation, besides that, it's mostly a psychological thing."
11024,I,N,T,J,"it's more like a feeling that even though you understand your enviroment, you feel like you don't belong there. like you're an alien or a ""player"" inside like, a VR game (the latter is more of a metaphor)."
11025,I,N,T,J,"I wish that I could go to a professional, just to see what it might be. but every time I've tried to talk about some mental health problems that I had with my parents they would get extremely angry at me for having it. they never got me help for my bulimia. and refuse to admit that I might have ADHD. so I really doubt they would ever get me help for something so much ""weirder"" than those.

&#x200B;

sorry for the rant, I know that your comment didn't have any of that"
11026,I,N,T,J,"it doesn't happen so often with me as it did when I was younger (I'm 16) but it's just so... weird, you know? I read some stuff about it and it says that abuse can be a cause. I have a very toxic family and am also a victim of rape, so it makes sense I guess.

&#x200B;

do you also have a feeling like you're either going crazy, or like you're an alien in a simulation/playing a video game in someone else's life when you have this?"
11027,I,N,T,J,"it's more of the first one. like, yesterday, when I posted this, I was looking through my phone gallery, found an old video of mine, and then my mind kind of went ""who is this person? that's not me. where am I? who am I? I don't know this person (me)"" and I was just so unconfortable and just wanted that feeling to stop. even though it only really lasts a few seconds, it feels so much longer than that"
11028,I,N,T,J,"hello! I would love to do this for you. I'm an anime artist and character designer and have quite a bit of interests similar to yours. 

you can see some of my work through my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/miwabii/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/miwabiart).

11029,I,N,T,J,they hate kids too
11030,I,N,T,J,"I’m brazilian, I speak portuguese, not spanish, so I don’t really know what saffa is."
11031,I,N,T,J,"idk if it’s the same in the U.S but in my country you need permission of your parents and a lot of paperwork, and my father (the toxic one in my house) won’t let me work. plus the pandemic. also, the jobs for people under 18 here are extremely underpaid, like R$480 per month, which is 85 USD."
11032,I,N,T,J,does that ever make you uncomfortable or anxious? or have you gotten used to it?
11033,I,N,T,J,"thank you! I’m an artist so I have the commission thing in my list, and my grandma is teaching me how to knit so I could probably do that as well. I still have the rest of this year and the next 2 until I’m legally an adult so it could probably give me a good amount to begin."
11034,I,N,T,J,art is easy and artists are born with talent for it
11035,I,N,T,J,Papai noel
11036,I,N,T,J,it CAN get worst.
11037,I,N,T,J,there is s light that never goes out by the smiths
11038,I,N,T,J,all the things she said. original by t.a.t.u and cover by poppy
11039,I,N,T,J,"I don’t, really, the worst part about my situation is that there’s nowhere else I can go. My sister, my brother and my mother live with me too, but they are enabling of his abuse and don’t say/do anything about it. I guess I’m safe physically, but I’m highly suicidal because of him."
11040,I,N,T,J,"it’s like, getting extremely and unpredictably mad for stupid reasons, like today when I didn’t want to give him my food, and he screamed at me, took away my computer and my internet (I’m using my phone secretly) and told me I’m ungrateful and that everything I have is his. or when I showed him a piece of art I made I was very proud of and he once again got unreasonably mad and asked why I wasn’t studying or doing something useful"
11041,I,N,T,J,"I really want to, but I don’t have any money and my other relatives live really far away from my city. I can’t get a job either."
11042,I,N,T,J,her face looks like a mask people would use in dystopian movies
11043,I,N,T,J,true brazilians build sand snowmen in the beach
11044,I,N,T,J,"ooh, that one hurt"
11045,I,N,T,J,honestly I really like your stuff. but maybe some of the enviroments could use more depth and the portraits proportions look a little off?
11046,I,N,T,J,"honestly, I’ve been trying to sell commissions for like, 3 months and haven’t gotten a single one yet, so I’m starting to think I might be delusional. this is my [instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/miwabii/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/miwabiart), as for my prices, full colors I do 20 headshot, 35 halfbody and 65 full body.

what do you guys think?"
11047,I,N,T,J,but… design is a form of art…?
11048,I,N,T,J,"hey! I’m a digital anime artist and I’m quite good at mimicking other anime styles. you can check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/miwabii/) and my top of all time post here on reddit (where I mimicked boku no hero’s style) for examples.

would love to hear back from you! my discord is miwabi#8729"
11049,I,N,T,J,but how would I get people to become patrons or support a gofundme if I can’t show them what the game looks like?
11050,I,N,T,J,"yea, I know, it’s going to be a long term project, but I wanted to start it already. hopefully if I can get a working demo I could start a gofundme/patreon to get some money to hire programmers."
11051,I,N,T,J,"oh, yeah. that’s cause I came up with a concept that I thought was really cool, and want to develop it. but I don’t want to sell my idea nor do I have money to hire someone, as I’m only 15 and don’t really have a job. so it’s not like I can do a lot about that “not being able to do 95% of the game” besides just trying to learn how to do things by myself."
11052,I,N,T,J,"sorry, I don’t understand what that means?"
11053,I,N,T,J,"hello! I’m a 2d anime artist and I really want to participate on your project. here’s my instagram: https://www.instagram.com/miwabii/

I’ve also sent you a discord friend request. (miwabi#8729)"
11054,I,N,T,J,"thank you!! your response has been the most useful yet, I don’t think that the others really understood that  I just wanted something to help me with the starting point, so I can get the base game working and maybe get some funding later on and actually hire programmers."
11055,I,N,T,J,"not really,, but I wanted to become a sk8r gurl myself"
11056,I,N,T,J,"I like both, but probably ps for the exclusives"
11057,I,N,T,J,"I have a memory of playing some of it but as I never had a nintendo console, not a lot.

there’s a game I played on steam called the good time garden, it’s a very short and weird game but it’s cool."
11058,I,N,T,J,"I don’t really like battle royales so I’ve only played PUBG a few times. I don’t know aveyond nor klonoa.

I used to play age of empires with my siblings when I was a kid, it was really fun!!"
11059,I,N,T,J,"1. not really, I have a hard time concentrating in those games and prefer fast paced, action, multiplayer games.

2. I think the oldest game I’ve played was from 09’ 

3. I prefer multiplayer team games! but I also like some single player"

11116,E,N,F,P,"Yes, but I absolutely hate messaging more. It's hard for me to communicate with text. I sound stiff in chat compared to irl conversations. I like calls more though, the tone and pitch can really help convey more."
11117,E,N,F,P,That's adorable I love him already
11118,E,N,F,P,"I've seen a book called ""ikigai"" before and had been mesmerized by it. I've always wanna buy it but can't afford it yet. I've always want to know more about the art of ikigai. I'm gonna start my 20s soon and I know that life will get harder and well knowledge is power."
11119,E,N,F,P,They need it
11120,E,N,F,P,In a with an INTJ for about  2 years and we're still romantically awkward irl and its cute
11121,E,N,F,P,"With an INTJ boyfriend here and have an INTJ as one of my best friends, I love being around these people. Their humor is rare and smart which ends up with me laughing uncontrollably. I don't notice but I tend to be reckless and they usually tell me if I'm too much. I understand because I wanna improve as a person and being reckless and spontaneous won't help me. When there is an idea oriented topic I enjoy conversing with them and fixing and improving our ideas. I love telling them my ideas, they critique it ell me what possible outcomes. They really bring the best out of me."
11122,E,N,F,P,My INTJ boyfriend has a hard time expressing how he feels and tends to be awkward in romantic or cheesy things... which i s kinda cute HAHAHAHA. He's rational and he has a habit calculating stuff (from our food orders to building heights).
11123,E,N,F,P,"I'm tearing up so bad man. I lost my cat before and this post just brings back so many memories. having a pet is such a wonderful type of love to experience. Even though there are so much struggles in life, there will always be a smol buddy waiting for your warm pets and affection. I know you will cherish memories of them like how I cherish mine and I know for sure Mac cherished every moment. Best of luck to you and may your little furry bud be in a better place. 💕"
11124,E,N,F,P,"I feel absolutely the same. I usually head out all the time and staying at home, for long periods of time, just gives me a depressing feeling. I try to cope with activities but it's not really the same."
11125,E,N,F,P,Im loving the all pink look <3
11126,E,N,F,P,Car and Dolphin?
11127,I,N,T,J,No its an entrance exam from 1st-year Msc to the second year. (applying for a research degree) everything will be included even things you'd least expect so I want to cover everything in detail.
11128,I,N,T,J,"An ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other, usually on the basis of similarities such as a common language, ancestry, history, society, culture, nation, religion, race or social treatment within their residing area.[1][2] Ethnicity is often used synonymously with the term nation, particularly in cases of ethnic nationalism, and is separate from, but related to the concept of races."
11129,I,N,T,J,Iraqis are arab you dumb kid :')
11130,I,N,T,J,"you thinking that ethnicity = religion prove that you're too retarded.

Since you got it all figured out don't ask.

Arab christians are a thing last time I checked and same goes for shia."
11131,I,N,T,J,"Not true more like half half at this point at best. 

Think about people from bekaa and akkar and some families in beirut. (also consider current and historic fertility rates)

The demography of Lebanon changed after france gave us the Bekaa area which was syrian.

If what you said was true this ""fake"" majority you have in mind wouldn't have allowed the rest to label lebanon as an arabian state.

Your social circles don't reflect reality keep that in mind"

11134,I,N,T,J,"sorry to break it to you but no one gives a fuck, nuclear weapons were tested in the open and if I am not mistaken tons of nuclear waste was thrown into the ocean.

Besides look around which goverments actually care about the enviroment even with the modern trend of enviromentalism.

Not saying what you're saying is bad but doubt anyone even considered the idea let alone act upon it back then.

Gaining some sort of a leverage through reverse engineering is probably the main if not only reason."
11135,I,N,T,J,"1- They are stupid
2- They think you're stupid

have your pick and go left"
11136,I,N,T,J,Because it takes others a ton of effort to do what we mindlessly do you can't expect them to understand.
11137,I,N,T,J,"In my country we have a saying

""A reputation for wealth is better than a reputation for poverty"" 

mind you I am not an expert translator and this saying is originally in lebanese arabic.


So why do you care ""reap the benefits"" of everyone wanting to be with an INTJ, annoying ? stupid? maybe but why bother yourself let it go its not like you're going to lose anything."
11138,I,N,T,J,"don't sell keep this for as long as you can and even if you want to sell keep at least 3 sets that's what I would do. 
you can also keep updating the collection would be pretty awesome in 20 years."
11139,I,N,T,J,"Stop thinking about bad shit to begin with.

Its a phase grow some balls it will go away and try meeting new people the planet isn't short on humans last time I checked."
11140,I,N,T,J,"Dating =/= Meeting people

If I am willing to date you it means I think highly of you enough to give up certain things like my personal freedom, and if I do that I certainly wouldn't consider anyone else.

That being said I would still talk to and flirt with anyone I click with 1 or 10 doesn't matter since I never restricted myself to one person or asked them to do the same.

Being official is a big step for me and it includes a whole other set of standards, but this is me idk about your guy.

Also for me her past doesn't matter as much as her current actions or what it says about her mentality, cheating doesn't mean much to me compared to other factors because

1- when someone it cheats it does happem for a reason though it does reflect a weak personality 

2- I wouldn't care much about anyone cheating on me since I'd simply walk out not a big deal

But I would be less trusting of her if there's a pattern.

Also stop worrying about who likes you and who doesn't be satisfied with yourself and whoever doesn't like it can fuck off you have nothing to lose. Change the mentality of him giving you a chance to you giving him a chance. (that applies both ways)"
11141,I,N,T,J,"1- Quit the defensive mentality, someone fucks with you fuck with them find out what they are insecure about and use it against them.

2-Narcissistic people will overlook their own shortcomings so that's a huge advantage for you to manipulate them so do just that.

3-Ignoring them should be a part of what you're going to do since it denies them the attention they seek.


but I mean you gotta be more specific and determine what what you want to achieve, best option unless you have something to gain move on and let them waste someone's else time and for fucks sake quit your emotional attachement to that person he/she won't do you any good."
11142,I,N,T,J,"Can confirm an INTJ I know does exactly that, but frankly I didn't fully believed it until now as I assumed she's a bit too smart to be that forgetfull.

Personally I never really forget stuff and I always had this unrealistic expectation that everyone else is like that as well."
11143,I,N,T,J,"Fun fact : Lebanon is not allowed to use the water from Al-Assi river because the syrians made an agreement with lebanon regarding the matter when Lebanon was a puppet state.

Let that sink in the  consider theft, corruption, killing, bombing, torture, extending and intensifying the civil war among other things."

11146,I,N,T,J,"its an INTJ thing, you gotta ""force"" them to admit stuff. Trust me its the same problem with INTJ girls they are pretty stubborn, admiting things is seen as a weakness in that sense."
11147,I,N,T,J,"If he thought you were a waste of time  he wouldn't do that trust me, I forget that people exist sometimes unless I enjoy their company

In my opinion you should try one of two things

1- Go all in and take things a step up

2- Distant yourself for a week or 2 and see how he reacts 

I expect that he'll check on you if you don't text, and even if he didn't ask you out he'll certainly be wondering about it.

You want him to like you make them think of you its that simple, he'll realize he misses you and wonder why you haven't asked him out but due to stubborns he might not initiate. But I expect that he'll check and see if you're fine.

I don't want to give you false hope, but you've been in this for years I guess so ....

Also not dating doesn't mean he would only be your friend, he might just be bothered with the nametag. You can normalize that by taking things a step up every now and then but I would test the waters and see how is he going to react."
11148,I,N,T,J,"Well I agree that's exactly why I never dated I see it as a pointless waste of time. 

That being said I can tell you that there were at least 2 times where I did consider dating, but thing is I had perfect chemistry with them. Well up until they ruined  with irrationalities, and I certainly wouldn't put much effort into that so I just walked away.

No one is just friends unless they don't really like you, even ""friends"" have ""friendly flirts"" did that ever happen? Do you talk often? Does he give you the impression that you're important to him? (little things count)

If your answer is No then I would suggest you start liking someone else.

Also please don't be clingy coz at least for me if someone is clingy I stop liking them."
11149,I,N,T,J,"well

1-Why did he give up on dating to begin with?

2-How would you describe your relationship with him?"
11150,I,N,T,J,"Why do you care? 

Though the answer is most probably not, nothing is impossible though if you know what you're doing that is."
11151,I,N,T,J,No they will just open your phone that said telegram > Whatsapp for many reasons

11156,I,N,T,J,"Fuck off and read history maybe after you grow a brain cell.

I have no empathy for syrians in hopes they get wiped out, the Syrian army killed lots of Lebanese including children. They raped women and stole lots of our resources and still control a portion of our water resources because of their allies.

So I really couldn't care less what happens in Syria as they deserve it same applies to palestinian both should be kicked out or taxed heavily for their stay."
11157,I,N,T,J,"expand your social circle then as I knew a handful of people who support peace.

Most people (average folks) go with the flow anyway regardless of what it is.

Plus you must adjust for the effect of social bullying which is why Trump got more votes than statistics showed. People don't publicly express their true opinions if it will damage their reputation, put them at risk or whatever."
11158,I,N,T,J,"What about the Syrian and Palestinian agressions? or different rules apply to them?

Also why should I care about what's happening to Palestinians, their problem and not mine, especially that they killed more Lebanese than Israel did."
11159,I,N,T,J,"Don't overthink talk often but doesn'r have to be all day nor does it have to be 24/7. Be casual about it and take care of your daily routine, talk to other people etc...

You can talk to her everyday for a few days then not text for a day or two or more.

Don't plan it."
11160,I,N,T,J,Did you rip your dick off or still pending?
11161,I,N,T,J,They'll probably cut his dick off and feed it to him.
11162,I,N,T,J,Sure dude I'll keep that in mind.
11163,I,N,T,J,"wonder why this was downvoted, the same still happens today more or less."
11164,I,N,T,J,"Being able to keep up with me, convo, debates teases etc...

That's why I find INTJ girls to be the best despite the fact that they are more likely than not to distant themselves and/or drive me crazy.

That being said being unpredictable is pretty good as well but out of all the girls only 2 girls were unpredictable both of which are ENFP. But they are prertt hard to deal with compared with other types they are just all over the place and that's what's I find attractive about them."

11167,I,N,T,J,"No I meant he was elected by the Law already in place.

I honestly believe he's going to win a second term we gotta wait and see 

I hope so too but it won't there will probably be a second explosion or major event before the end of this month unless the cave in for American/Israeli demands on thursday regarding the sourthern border and the French/American demands regarding the new goverment.

Anyway gotta wait and see the world is on fire until the US election is over until then everything is possible."
11168,I,N,T,J,"NOT TRUE the House Speaker is elected not chosen.

Fact Check before you share stuff.

The parliament Elects the president, the house speaker, and approves the Prime Minister. So effectively the president suggests a primse minister and the parliament must approve before the goverment can be established.

The greatest motivation is reminding yourself why you're doing this and what you're giving up if you don't.

Best of luck for everyone."
11171,I,N,T,J,"you missed why I mentioned Trump, he didn't change the law when he was elected now did he? which is why I partially disagree with you. 

Take my word for it I live in an overly democratic country what you said about decolving is absolutely true we're slowly brcoming a police state the ""new"" president is locking people up for breaking his pic including a minor or for simply tweeting against him or his son in law/party.

The lebanese democracy died because it was over democratic. (Over democratic as in EVERY major sect can veto and every sect major or not have demands which ruins things)

Anyway man have a nice day and I truly hope that the US doesn't fall apart though the chinese are hoping for it."

Don't get me wrong democracy can be retarded and I don't believe its the best way to go sometimes the majority is retarded (example: Lebanon)"
11174,I,N,T,J,"I am not american but having a police force is kinda vital to maintain order in any society but that wasn't the point.

If democracy means we gotta live in chaos then I don't want it.

Also I don't think those who agree with me are looking for a coup but rather those who are destroying private and public property, which I don't think the US constitution supports or encourage.

The Left is a joke 

""we want democracy""
 *elections*
 ""What trump won that is BS we won't have it*

Democracy is a system where the majority of people decide how the society should be run, just so you would know. Voting is the only wayz if you're going to be a sour loser then don't tell me or anyone else you respect the system or liberty.

Either way you guys enjoy fucking the US up, mine is already fucked up, but now I gotta start learning chinese I guess.

11175,I,N,T,J,"Dismantle property WTF?

How can people so stupid have equal rights to normal folks..."
11176,I,N,T,J,"wanna hear something crazy?

Our (Lebanese) foreign affairs minister resigned literally 1 day before the explosion and they rushed to place someone else (Never ever in the history of this country did it happen so quickly)

The day before the explosion there were multiple airstrikes against hezebollah in syria and iranian militias in iraq.

The official story of what happened has changed multiple times already.

They banned Norwegian rescures and the press from entering the location.

France didn't allow an NGO to come to beirut and aid the teams on the ground.

The Managers of the port were absent from the location.

You can see some object falling from the sky like 3 seconds before the huge explosion (some say its a bird but I saw 3 different videos all show the same thing from 3 different angles and last time I checked birds don't fly into fires do they?)

This is the first time that no one accuses Israel of attacking like usually for whatever reason they accuse Israel but that day according to reports 22 Israeli airplanes brached the lebanese airspace yet they ignored that.

Long list my bad there's other crazy things for us to notice I don't think we're crazy we're just attentive."

Other advice: treat him like a human being and remember that just because he's an INTP and you're into him, don't tailor yourself to fit him. If you vibe, you vibe. If you don't, you don't.

If you have to change the way you would normally talk with people just to get a conversation going with him, maybe it isn't necessarily a match. Just saying."

11203,I,N,T,P,"You just pointed out how you're becoming a better person by comparing you now to you from two years ago. It may not seem like much, but you're making great progress. You know you have an issue and you want to fix it, and that is the most important thing.

The truth is I don't like having friends over but I still have a craving for social interaction just like any other person. That's why online interactions are very convenient for me.

11210,I,N,T,P,"That's awesome! I think that your story is very inspirational for many people out there, and I hope others learn from it."
11211,I,N,T,P,"In your own opinion, do you think that interactions like this are truly social interaction?"
11212,I,N,T,P,"Well there are a lot of things that come in to play with this. One: whether or not you are attracted to people who tend to act like an INTJ, two: if you see their confidence as arrogance or impressive, and three: INTJ's are not liked by everyone therefore everyone will have different answers.

Of course there are more points to be made but I think these are the most important. So, the answer is subjective.

But if you held a gun to my head and forced me to answer I would probably say yes because I find people with extraordinary confidence attractive."

11218,I,N,T,P,"Alright, I think you have a great point there. Its just odd that these noises never came up again, (except for obviously the mouse that lived above me) but, I suppose it could have just strolled by.
I've never believed in the whole ghost thing anyway. its glad to know that there is probably a reasonable explanation for this."
11219,I,N,T,P,"That's an interesting idea and one that I hope is not true, because it brings up a lot of disturbing questions."
11220,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, that's also a possibility that I overlooked until you brought it up. All I can say against that is that it sounded heavier than that. I've actually heard rodents moving around up there before--there was a mouse living in my ceiling not long ago--but it sounded completely different. When the mouse moved, it sounded more like scratching. But, the footstep noises were distinctively human sounding, separate from the mouse."

It's the death of the babysitter character, I forget her name, but the way it plays out, her screaming, the fact that it's such a long death for a character that not only doesn't deserve the fate she receives, but also the fact that no one ever mentions it, and the fact that said character was going to get married after the events of the movie, had she not died. It's not only the longest death scene in the entire Jurassic series, but it also doesn't capture what we love about long, drawn out cinematic death scenes, that being when the character in question actually deserves it. This death sucks ass, because it's over the top and way undeserved. Now, had she not actually died in that scene, I think it's possible that this scene could have possibly been good. But they had to kill her off in the way they did, creating a scene that is so narratively unsatisfying that it's downright enraging."

If you're a religious person, and you aren't using it as an excuse to be an asshole, all the power to you.

11289,I,N,T,J,"I would say I liked a few select songs from Aurora, but not the album as whole. For instance, I absolutely adore the Aurora version of “Dance with the Devil” (I’m a sucker for Adam Gontier) but the entire album is basically just acoustic versions of their old songs. It’s no surprise that it wouldn’t be a favourite among fans tbh. It just doesn’t have as much of a “wow” factor because there’s technically not much that is new.

That doesn’t mean it isn’t good. It’s helped me introduce Breaking Benjamin to my less-tolerant-of-rock-and-metal friends. It’s also quite easy on the ears, making it a good ear palette cleanser for when you want a break from all the aggressive guitar- and drum-playing but still wanna listen to songs you like."
11290,I,N,T,J,Lmao you’re welcome.
11291,I,N,T,J,"Okay since you seem to like to see the worst in people, *now* I am going to antagonize you.

I regret *attempting* to leave a kind message for someone who is not worth it.

Thank you for your analysis. In retrospect, I did make a poor choice of words. It did come off very wrong, and I am not surprised, given that English is not my mother tongue, but I do not regret that at all now.

I did not look down on you before this. After all, what do I know? I am a 17 year old student that knows nothing about life or the real world, so how the hell would I look down on someone talking about life experience? But the way you interpret everything as an attack on you made me realize that even people with more experience than me can be really awful. I do not normally look down on people, and even religiously I am not allowed to do so, but there are things that people do that make me feel very sorry for them.

You say I do not speak from the heart. Of course I am not. You seemed like some random angry old creep on reddit that I do not know. What did you expect? I cannot exactly empathize with someone I do not know anything about. I did the most that I could do and left what I intended to be a kind message. You say it is emotional constipation, but for me, it is valuing my emotions and saving them for the people who actually matter in my life. Just because I am not showing you love or empathy does not mean I am incapable of either or struggle with them at all. It just means I am choosing the people I deem as trustworthy to share these emotions with.

If you think I am an egotistical person, then good for you. You are no one close or dear to me, so it does not really matter what you think of me and you do not actually know anything about me to make a judgement like that. But the fact that you are using my MBTI to make a generalization is very irrational. You know it is pseudoscience, right? That you cannot use it as actual evidence for anything, right?

Also, I said your art was pretty decent as a compliment. I do not know anything about art, but I was speaking my honest opinion. It was not as visually pleasing as other things I have seen, but I liked it. If you want to see that as me looking down on you, then go ahead. I was only saying my opinion. It is not my fault you get insulted by everything, even a compliment.

I would wish you a good day, but I really would not mean it."
11292,I,N,T,J,"I’m definitely an upper. Depends on how independent/confident the introvert may be. After all, “introvert” does not equal “timid.”"

11295,I,N,T,J,"I did not accuse you of anything, though. I did not intend to, anyway, and I do not know how you inferred that from what I said, but it was definitely not what I was implying. I only replied with what you said in your previous comment, and I did not mean any offence with it. I apologize if that is how it seemed. Again, that was not my intention.

I do not know how antagonizing the people around you helps you, but apparently it does, so I will not take what you said toward me too seriously and I should not and will not judge you for it.

In any case, good luck with your art. It looks pretty decent."
11296,I,N,T,J,"That’s a pretty shitty ex. You also seem like you need some help yourself, though. Take care of yourself, or have fun with what is left of your life, I guess, since you do not really seem to want to take care of yourself."
11297,I,N,T,J,"I call bullshit on people who say xNTx’s cannot be emotionally supportive.

Sure, it comes more naturally for these types to suggest solutions to a problem than to provide a shoulder to cry on, but that doesn’t mean that every INTP or INTJ, for instance, is such a social idiot that they are not able to recognize when and how to provide emotional support.

It is a basic human social skill that everyone should know how to do. Being “NT” should not be an excuse for being an asshole and too arrogant to learn how to comfort others.

11304,I,N,T,J,"I would disagree. 

I am an INTJ, but I enjoy debates and discussing my ideas and theories, but I am most definitely introverted. 

I don’t mean I’m timid, because I’m not, I just get so drained around other people, even if they are my closest friends. 

I’m always alone and I prefer it that way, but when I get a mind-blowing idea, I feel a strong desire to share it with someone to confirm how good of a thought it is. 

Granted, I talk to myself about these ideas most of the time, and I immediately go back to isolation once I’ve shared my thoughts, but that doesn’t change the fact that I do enjoy discussing them."

I had the colonoscopy yesterday and it seems like I probably have IBS.
However, now I feel ENORMOUSLY n* after eating ANYTHING, my throat is burning after every meal and I keep having cramps worse than before.

11332,E,N,T,P,"The ""Rejection of Core Self"" was scarily accurate.

Growing up as a gifted child, everybody kept expecting a lot from me and every time I failed, others were disappointed; so that lead me to trying to be loved by creating a new persona that would be considered ""loveable"" every time I came into a new group of people.

I crashed later by stopping to try and achieve anything because I was extremely afraid of failure judgement; and to this date, I'm still baffled every time a friend tells me they love me for my true self which I always hid away.

The ironic part is that my achievements that I wanted to use to prove that I was worth something were the very same reason I got bullied by others."

11342,E,N,T,P,"I know it's fucking tough, and trust me, I'm still struggling to accept myself too.

I'm currently 16, but already at the age of nearly 12 I thought that I may be a lesbian because I actively fell for a girl for the first time. I didn't know her and only saw her once, but I was still swept off my feet.
I brushed it all off tho as I had past guy crushes that- looking back on them- were either my best friends or kinda forced but, yet I was still holding on to that, assuming it was real love although the thought of getting together with a dude never appealed to me and I never felt nervous or had a heart race around them.

I craved romance from the age of 13 on, but just could not picture myself with a guy; this made me assume I was ace.
But when I was 14 and had a talk with my mom about it,  it all crashed down on me and I felt as if I knew what was up with me. Once I imagined being with a girl, it felt so right. I just knew.

Nonetheless, it took me nearly 1,5 years to finally draw the conclusion that I am a homosexual.

I often wonder if I would have maybe seen it sooner if I didn't spend my entire childhood only around boys, despising girls because they weren't ready to do some criminal wack shit.
After all, I only had one slightly dirty fantasy before puberty and it occurred after I had seen a bunch of homoerotic MVs when I was 10. I imagine I was older and making out with a girl. And I liked it.

And since I started to actively deal with girls from 5th grade on, I would sometimes feel nervous around them meanwhile you could throw me into a huge group of guys and I would be able to keep my cool.
I'm now convinced that I had a thing for one of my classmates because giving a girl an A4 page letter that says that you wanna be her friend because she's so ""kind and pretty"" and asking her to read it alone is not a very straight thing to do; especially since I usually befriend people by hanging out with them and never feel SO ANXIOUS that I can't even talk.

It takes time to accept yourself and it's scary. You may be hit with anxiety as if it's a truck. And one day, you'll have to take the terrifying step of not hiding your sexuality from anyone (if you live in a safe place).
You bet it is scary when somebody you are not even close to asks you if you are queer and you decide to stop hiding and open up instead.
And it sucks if you don't know what your family will think. Or if they react negatively.
(I live in Germany but my parents are Slavic and they didn't take it well; I doubt I'll ever tell the rest about my orientation.)

So I just wish you all the best. It's tough, my friend, but trust me: finding one part of yourself or coming to terms with it is an incredibly important and defining experience.

You are you. Remember that. And it's okay being the way you are.

xxx, CheriLady"

11362,E,N,T,P,"In my childhood I used to read multiple books a month, sometimes even within one week, yet the older I grew, the more boring everything got as everything seemed so predictable for me that I even quit reading at the age of 11. Teenage novels never appealed to me, most adult books were too boring (why should a child be interested in social novels or erotica?) and I just stopped reading for a few years.
Kid me was also extremely into sciences but due to the judgement of peers and then the absolutely awful school system, I also distanced myself from this type of literature.

Recently I tried (and still am trying) to get back into it but the only stuff I like are crime novels (especially the ones from Agatha Christie), the stories of Edgar Allan Poe and some older classics (Ray Bradbury, George Orwell etc); it's still hard for me to concentrate tho as I took such a long break.

Looking back I could say that reading was probably partly a good escape from the outside world as I, despite being really extroverted, had trouble connecting with people due to our age difference (I skipped a grade; or, to be precise, I switched from 2nd to 3rd close to the end of the year) and as I'm also suspected to have autism.

Sorry for this choppy answer, I just woke up and can't really write fluent texts on my phone; and in case you wanna know: I'm currently 15, turning 16 soon.

Edit: After looking at the other answers I may also add that I prefer wider overviews when it comes to scientific/ practical books as this benefits me more that going into depth in just one matter. This is why I also love collections of random facts."

11374,E,N,T,P,"Why do I, an ENTP, see myself in this?!"
11375,E,N,T,P,Can relate.

11377,I,N,T,J,"I believe knowing her age is necessary to determine which approach is appropriate and if you need to address it at all. However, based on her reaction, it might be something you don't need to change. 乁( . ര ʖ̯ ര . )ㄏ

If she's not mature enough (age wise or mentally) to see the difference between art and porn (though it's arguable whether porn can be also some form of art), that's her issue."

11380,I,N,T,J,"He was. :) 
Thank you."
11381,I,N,T,J,"When I was a teenager and felt very edgy, I told this guy who confessed to me that I'll never date a spinless loser like him and even laughed about it with the same friend who had a crush on him before but he declined (in more polite way, I must add).

My father overheard me with my friend on the phone and told me afterwards how disappointed he was, because he always taught me to respect everyone no matter what. I felt pretty bad, which doubled when I found out the guy actually cried because of me.

I apologized and never did it again. It was so shitty that now I'm embarrassed just thinking about it."
11382,I,N,T,J,I still do it 😂
11383,I,N,T,J,"Dude friends-to-lovers is probably the best way for INTJ. We have far more important things to do with our time then.. mingle.

11384,I,N,T,J,"Yeah we are very loyal, aren't we? The understanding in this group is so insane haha"
11385,I,N,T,J,"Damn, it still is. I've never been in long, solid relationships actually. I'm bi as well, so with men it was less of a problem, though I'm less interested. With the ladies, though.. it came from them. 

Uh. The gym is the only place people try to talk to me. And since I don't like to talk and work out, you can imagine how my love life are going haha.

The only time I confessed was when I was 18, and it felt like a terrible mistake because we were both bad for each other."
11386,I,N,T,J,Interesting point. It's frustrating sometimes as a woman being in a relationship with another woman. I come across as insensitive more than I'd like to admit.
11387,I,N,T,J,Well made! Thank you.

11389,I,N,T,J,"Basically pushing myself into routine of writing extending the time by five minutes until I'm getting used to sit my ass down and stop being ADHD all over the place. 
I change small things every now and then, though. 

Sometimes I write things on paper when I really can't concentrate. Or sit in a different room or on the floor.

Lately I found this game ""Virtual Cottage"" (free on Steam) and I thought it won't do much, but it's actually helpful."
11390,I,N,T,J,"I'm not HOH and haven't watched Deaf U, but I keep reading the weirdest things about it..

When I watch HOH/deaf youtubers, for example, they hardly mouth the words unless the other person didn't get it (so they will spell it before anything if still not clear) or if they are alone in front of the camera knowing people watch them to also learn, which doesn't happen much either given the captions.

Sorry if I'm wrong, it's something I just noticed.
When I'm signing, I find it very uncomfortable to speak at the same time, but I'm still a new learner so.. I might be wrong haha"
11391,I,N,T,J,"My demons says yes.

And please send help."
11392,I,N,T,J,"All those questions of how to write man/woman/non-bi/black/asian/etc are understandable, especially if you come from cultural perspective. That's fine.

But, as a writer, don't forget one simple thing. It's first about the core, then everything else. Not everyone think/feel the same regardless their gender or where they came from.
Go with the flow of the personality, motives and the character's background story (is the character came from a house where the father is driven by ego? Maybe he's a natural leader? The mother was harsh or caring?).
It will fall into place just like that.

Aside from it, my advice is to go r/askMen and read some posts."
11393,I,N,T,J,Brought you by: people who lick a cookie so no one else will have it.
11394,I,N,T,J,Shhh. Stop it. Get some help.

Editorial work isn't meant only to point out technical errors but also to advise and highlight problems that we, as writers, couldn't see due to how deep we got into the vision of our work.

You're giving your final draft to be reviewed (but definitely not your final product) by someone who's job is find the red flags, what nowadays readers won't be willing to have, therefore a product that won't sell well. 

He didn't change his entire work. Didn't say it was horrible.
OP put time and effort to make it better. 

You don't have to do anything. But listening to others isn't a bad thing, especially when it's a critical moment in something you put years of making."
11398,I,N,T,J,"You sound like a delightful person to work with! Wow! 

Just one question though, can you turn down the bitchiness a little? Because this whole comment just pouring so much.. yikes energy"

11404,I,N,T,J,"Thank you for elaborating. In my head it didn't make much sense using unnecessary fillers, but it is very human behavior to delay while thinking ahead, so I just had to ask haha."
11405,I,N,T,J,"לא לא, זה בסדר. נעשה הפגנה עוד יומיים כי אזרחי ישראל לא אוהבים לקחת אחריות על עצמם וזהו! לא תהיה קורונה יותר! :D"

11409,I,N,T,J,"That's..

11419,I,N,T,J,"Dude, congrats! It feels nice to finally have one.

Didn't get another one after that but got so many JINs I couldn't care less haha"
11420,I,N,T,J,"You just know that even with that amount, red is not guaranteed and that's so annoying"
11421,I,N,T,J,"Mm. You have a point.   


Okay. If you say that's an acceptable thing to do, I'll take your word for it haha.  
I've been in writing communities for a while, it seems very different from the fanfiction communities, sharing and telling wise"
11422,I,N,T,J,"Thank you!   
As for the second part, I feel like.. I don't know, a little rude for expecting people to do so? Since I'm not sure I'm good at my writing and all, it looks a little pushy. x:"
11423,I,N,T,J,"I'm glad you like the tags haha

And you get to learn something new regardless your skill level, I guess. 
That's the reason why I constantly looking for criticism instead of pushing it away like I used to years ago.

English isn't my native language (as you probably can tell) and at times I feel bland too as you felt before. Like, many times I just don't do enough. So I can't afford looking away anymore if I want to become an author.
This experience gave me new experimental light and it's so much fun"
11424,I,N,T,J,"Please do. That's what I'm looking for.   
Glad you like the premise! 

I'll read yours. I'm not yet familiar with RWBY, but the writing looks good.   
(Boy, don't even get me started on editing after publishing.)"
11425,I,N,T,J,"Woah, damn. I really appreciate the help.   


I'll take everything into consideration. Thank you so much.   
I did published the fan-work in the first place to get criticism and grow more as a writer, so I really hope this platform will give my learning curve some boost. 

  
[The work](https://archiveofourown.org/works/25656124/chapters/62284435)

11441,I,N,T,P,"I’m thinking of focusing a bit on alchemy as a main class for now, with close combat,  puppetry, and archery to back me up.

I planned on mostly using alchemy and puppetry, while using close combat when, well, close combat becomes necessary lol (dungeons don’t really give good range when the rooms get locked). Doing so while keeping my bard skills and lute with me cause  that could always be useful (Hello, Battle Overture).

I still have trouble getting used to puppetry but it’s just SO FUN.

However, I might need to get more alchemy skills than « shoot water » and « Shoot air » first lol

11451,I,N,T,P,"Referencing to mental alchemy?

And tbh, I don’t think it’s only about metal and ovens for everyone, or else that’d be metallurgy or chemistry-

For many, it’s a History lesson, for others, it’s a spiritual way, can also be both for some, or even something else.

To me, it’s a path I’m willing to try out of will and curiosity: I want to grow, and discover that science of the occult, that art called alchemy. I want to embrace every form of it I can, and, obviously, grow into a better person as I do so. It’s not just about metals and ovens, it’s about the soul you put into it, and it’s also about your your interaction with the matter around you for many, I believe. Alchemy and mental alchemy aren’t incompatible, they’re, from what I’ve seen, different ways to take the same path of transmutation of the self, aren’t they, in some way? At least that’s what I read in that one book I found in my school’s library + my analysis of what I heard here (and my small personal experience) :D"

11529,I,N,T,J,"Thankfully I was right by ice and cold water, so I was able to get it cooled off right away. About a half hour ish after that happened they gave me burn cream as well, so no scarring thankfully."
11530,I,N,T,J,"At Starbucks, if you ask for extra hot coffee it will be at a max of 190. You average cup of Starbucks is (if I remember correctly) 160. The hot tea/americano water is another story though......that’s straight from our special hot water spigot and is at 200 I believe... was not fun when I spilled a venti americano on my hand as a green bean lol."
11531,I,N,T,J,Those signs are all over California.....it’s sad really
11532,I,N,T,J,"Had sorta the same thing for a place I rented, but with the toilets. Idk if that’s common or not, but they made it EXTREMELY clear not to do that lol."
11533,I,N,T,J,My mom apparently did that.....then blames it on my uncle as well!!
11534,I,N,T,J,But not impossible
11535,I,N,T,J,"My stance on that is let kids be friends with who they want to be, but if they start copying behavior make sure they know that bad behavior won’t be tolerated by you...if they mention how the other kid is doing it, have an age appropriate discussion about why that kid is different to where they understand. Don’t limit kids, you will cause the other to feel hurt and not good enough. It tells the kids they are not good enough, even if they are trying their hardest. Yes behavior rubs off, but it’s on the parents to correct it, not create holes in friendships."
11536,I,N,T,J,"All I was saying is that kids should be able to choose who they want to be friends with. Let their parents parent them if they are behaving badly, but don’t tell your kids not to hang out with a kid because of how they are. And you never know, the “normal” kids behavior might run off on the other. (Which is the most common occurrence) all I’m saying is that it hurts the kid who is different by telling them they can’t hang out with someone cuz they are weird. It teaches them at a young age that they aren’t worth anything. All I am saying is let your kid form their own opinions, parents shouldn’t tell kids what to think about those around them besides the necessary to survive (like stranger danger). As a child I was repeatedly told not to hang out around kids, because their parents didn’t want me around them, and that hurt and caused self esteem issues for years. That’s why I am just lobbying for people to let their kids choose, and if they start to pick up bad habits, then correct them on it. If they say “well they do it”, then maybe have a sit down with them and explain a little bit. Not enough to make them treat their friend differently, but enough to where they realize not to copy the behavior. All I’m saying is there are so many better, and healthier, ways to approach this sort of a situation that benefit everyone involved. I am sorry for being rude as well, this matter hits close to home because of how I was treated when I was younger, and I lashed out when I should not have."
11537,I,N,T,J,"That also doesn’t excuse the fact you have told me that I shouldn’t exist. You get on me for belittling you? I’m just speaking the truth. And even if it is belittling, think about what you were saying to me."
11538,I,N,T,J,"I’m actually an adult female, and I don’t live with my mom either......both of us may have assumed things, but at the same time saying someone’s projecting is one of the most commonly used tropes to escape a guilty conscience. If anything you are trying to project onto me. I am perfectly happy with my life, and I can’t imagine it any other way, and I am proud to be autistic."
11539,I,N,T,J,"Yes, projection uhhuh.......sounds like you are just deflecting....truth hurts little boy"
11540,I,N,T,J,"Not what I’ve been doing, and you are the one who keeps continuing the conversation.......yet I’m the one obsessing? Lol okay then, run back to your mommy little boy"

11544,I,N,T,J,Thank you!
11545,I,N,T,J,Teach the normal kids properly and they won’t. At that point it’s just bad parenting.
11546,I,N,T,J,I’m not insecure. I am confident in who I am as a person and am happy with where I am as a person. Good luck in your life you are gonna need it
11547,I,N,T,J,I never told those around me. I did research and was able to improve upon myself without asking for handouts.
11548,I,N,T,J,"I will have kids, and cannot wait for them. Yeah they will be autistic, we will be one big happy autistic family and honestly I cannot wait for that because I know they will make it so much farther than people like you ever will. Have fun with a sad depressing life sir, I hope you enjoy every last second of your disgusting, miserable existence. You will never make an impact on the world, or amount to anything, but enjoy it. Because you earned it. (By being a shitty human being)"
11549,I,N,T,J,"My mom never told me I had autism until my senior year of high school when I came to her because I thought I had it. I was able to figure it out on my own, I was able to notice the differences. Bo matter what you say eventually they will notice or commit suicide from depression. By not informing them they weren’t able to pick up on bad habits and correct social cues, therefor not forming the social connections needed. Versus telling them early on so they know what to watch out for and correct. I got so depressed in high school because I kept trying to connect and thought I was doing everything right, but wasn’t able to make any lasting connections at the time. After my mom told me, I was able to recognize what was going on and adapt better to be able to form social bonds with people. Now I have a fiancé, friends, my own place, two adorable cats, a supportive, loving, caring family, my dream job and a degree. Before I was told I had autism and helped properly with how to deal with it, I was flunking out of high school, had depression, and no friends. I am literal proof that what you are saying would not work. I hope to god your kids don’t have autism, only because if they did their lives would be a living hell caused by you."
11550,I,N,T,J,"First of all, I am a girl. Second of all, if that’s the case, then the mentally disabled (like yourself) should also be euthanized. Because obviously something is wrong with you since you are so close minded. Thirdly, what if your child whom you love so dearly at the age of five is diagnosed with autism? Would you euthanize your five year old child who is the light of your life and the reason you keep living? I don’t think you would. Good luck with your opinions on things, and good luck in life, your gonna need it because you are obviously going no where."

11552,I,N,T,J,"By the way, I and my fiancé are autistic and yet I am doing so much better in life than you ever could be. I have someone who loves me for me, I have a loving family, plenty of friends, a college degree and my dream job. Along with being able to buy whatever I want or need whenever I want or need it. All because there were people who stuck by me, who weren’t driven away by the fact that I’m a little different. You think that bad behavior rubs off, I hope to god yours doesn’t rub off on your kids or else they will become just as cold, and selfish as you are. Because kids deserve more than that, they deserve love and compassion. Yeah, I can really see how much you care for your kids."
11553,I,N,T,J,"No, it’s not fair. But it’s disgusting people like you who make this world worse. What if your kid was autistic? Would they still be your whole world, and you would do anything for them? Or would you force them to stop all their coping behaviors? No tapping allowed because it’s autistic. You like horses? Too bad, no special interests. Your kids will hate you, and you will have to live with that. Or what if it was you? Imagine you are this little kid who just made a new friend, you are so happy because it’s your first friend. They very next day your mom comes to you and tells you not to hang out with them. How would you feel as a kid, if your mom told you that you couldn’t hang out with your new friend because you were a little different? Segregating them is not the answer. In fact it is just reverting this country to 100 years ago. Are you racist too? Obviously you believe that a certain group of people should be kept completely separate from those that are considered “normal”. Should they drink from separate fountains too?"
11554,I,N,T,J,"And this just proves how fucking childish and small minded you are. Turns to insults when they don’t have any logic to back up their claims. Good luck with your small minded approach to life. While you are slaving away trying to make a living, my (future) kids and I are going to get far because they will be brilliant, and kind, and beautiful. It doesn’t matter whether they are autistic or not, it’s all to do with how the parent raises them. I am going to raise my kids to embrace how they are, and to excel in life. Sounds like all you are teaching your kids is how to be bitter. Let me tell you this: your kids WILL grow up to resent you, because you kept them from being able to make friendships that could last a lifetime. They will grow up to hate you for forbidding them to hang out with some of the nicest and friendliest people they have ever met. And one day, when you are old and needing help with life, they won’t be there to support you because you drove them away."
11555,I,N,T,J,"This mindset is what causes so many setbacks among us, we don’t learn the social skills we need because of this, it’s so frustrating."
11556,I,N,T,J,"No using Facebook, or anything by Elon musk because that would be promoting bad behavior right? They aren’t smart enough, they would just sit and screech. Obviously someone who is neurotypical actually invented those things because someone with autism or Aspergers just, isn’t smart enough. God when will you idiots understand it’s all a spectrum? Someone can be street smart but not book smart, or book smart but not socially smart. There’s emotional intelligence, regular intelligence, social intelligence, and common sense. You can have all or none......it’s obvious you have none."
11557,I,N,T,J,"No, it’s a fucking spectrum. There are those who are overly emotional, those who have almost regular emotions, and those who are more closed off. And just because it seems like they have no emotions doesn’t mean they don’t feel hurt when you forbid them to hang out with someone. I have autism and most the time I don’t feel much. But I can tell you this, I felt plenty of emotions when I learned I WASNT GOOD ENOUGH to hang out with a kid. That’s what you parents are telling these kids who need the most support. That they aren’t good enough, and never will be and it hurts. We are human too."
11558,I,N,T,J,"It is a fundamental difference in how the brain is built. It’s not something you can teach out of a kid, and it’s not bad behavior. It’s how they are. Those kids work tirelessly every day trying to fit in, just wanting to have a friend and it’s people like you who make them feel worthless. You don’t think they are trying? They don’t know any better, but are still trying their hardest to be the best person they can be. And then someone like you comes along and makes them feel like shit! What the hell is wrong with you?!?"
11559,I,N,T,J,"Same here. Had lots of friends but after a few play dates I was told I wasn’t allowed to play with them anymore. Found out later it’s cuz I’m autistic and their parents didn’t want me near them as a “bad influence”. It hurt so much when that happened, and didn’t allow me to make proper social connections, further stunting my social and emotional growth."
11560,I,N,T,J,"Thank you, I will definitely try this!"

11563,I,N,T,J,"I worked for a rather famous coffee chain for a year, and it was absolutely terrible but the thing that finally pushed me to quit was an incident right after my year mark there. I had been having some health issues (that I let my manager know about) and ended up puking and almost passing out in their restroom. When I finally came out, my manager asked me what I thought causes that to happen, never once asked me if I was okay, and kept pushing me to stay for the rest of my shift. I eventually flat out had to tell her that if I stayed any longer she would have to call an ambulance.....to which she asked me if I was sure that I couldn’t stay. Thankfully the on-duty shift at the time told me to go home and rest up. Took me less than a month to get out of there after that."

11588,I,N,T,J,"I really liked the positive solution u/unicornhulk gave, but In case that doesn’t work I have another answer. 

I am an INTJ with an ESFJ mother.. to think my first suicide attempt happened at 9 years old because of her.

I grew up in constant damage control mode: 
For example I’d worry about my mothers poor spending habits and she would always get angry and tell me to stay in a child’s place (even if I suffered later down the line). So instead of communicating with her I let my antics and actions handle the issues. I’d make it to where any conflict that could happen- wouldn’t. Plan ahead of her every outburst and emotion based reasonings for what she says and does. This might also seem selfish but I’d recommend focusing on yourself/ whilst making sure you stay true to yourself. 

You’re going to hate yourself by trying to conform to her whims, please trust me on this one. Accept the situation for what it is and asking yourself- “Do I want/need to be around this?” 
    You can and may try to become more lenient with her.
But if that does not work after a while, Save the energy for yourself and let her work her bells and whistles through. even if people can change, some people will not change Unless they have no other choice. 
  But don’t let me tell you how to live your life, do what you want to do because you want to do it- it’s going to be hard to have a good balance with an insufferable person, so see if there’s anything salvageable. 

Even though she’s probably going to dislike this- you may need some space man."

Imagine seeing a problem- and not having the ability to do anything about it. Spent my entire childhood seeing problems happen and suffering collateral damage because I am a child who knows nothing. 

I remember the happiest I ever was - was when she divorced and I was sent away to my grandparents, they actually listened to me even if they didn’t always agree. Ever since then I’ve been playing catch-up. Oh and unfortunately she missed having her kids so she took us away from my grandparents.

Eventually I realized I was not ready for that rodeo again and I made distance, and with that distance came guilt tripping or something (you people don’t deserve me mentality) - just said goodbye forever and left. She would send me a handful of links and affirmations basically trying to talk to me all day everyday; sun-up to sun-down. 

Even better: I remember handing my phone to a stranger because she wouldn’t stop talking and they ended up speaking for about 4 hours easily.

I have an ESFJ mother and an ISFP stepfather, And my current best friend is an ISFJ-

My mother tries but is very volatile when it comes to the hard to make decisions, but she is very supportive for emotions and will literally get into hours of conversations when she leaves the house.

My ISFP stepfather is too precious, always there for anyone in their time of need- always positive even in the worst case scenarios and has even healed me in my states of mania- 

Oh and a special mention to my ISFJ best friend/ arch enemy jokingly: before I left to the military he gave me parting gifts (I’ve never been gifted without giving something in return). And when I came back all broken he picked me up and helped me back on my feet. So yes, with all that in mind and with them on my side I’m sure things will improve. :)"

11614,I,N,T,J,"Hey about your shirt and your hair. Let me hit you with this- 

Did you notice how some people seemed to disagree with your style whereas others really seemed into it? That’s kinda how attraction and swipes on dating apps work (I’m referring to the bumble experiment).

Let’s say 10/10(100%) of people say you’re rated at *7/10 “hey this curly hair guy is pretty cute” you’d  simply be-cute.
Whereas let’s say 7/10 (70%) of people rated you a smoking 10/10 and the other (30%) 3/10 people disliked your features calling you a 0/10 rating. 

In both cases you’d be a 7/10 but the attention you’d get would be different. 

Before I end on this I will like to use an example of people with tattoos or colorful hair. Some people hate it, but those who like it- LOVE it. 

In the bumble experiment- the people who had more “disagreeable features” were seen as more attractive and were reported to receive more messages than those who were overall pretty average on the good side. 

I’ll end it on this though- It wouldn’t do you any justice to say you’re average, your features are disagreeable but that’s what gives you attraction. If you were to get rid of the shirt and hair you’d be basic, then you’d actually be average. You get me?"
11615,I,N,T,J,"Based on these comments I don’t need to tell you that you’re cute, so let me try to be constructive:

You brought up insecurities- something I relate to in a way. I get told I am not bad looking and actually fine even to a number of people, but because how I view myself, I end up dissatisfied with my own personal expectations. Anyways I really respect that you decided to post.

11621,I,N,T,J,I did not google because I was under the impression that I would be searching for a very specific answer. If you would be willing to share I would appreciate it. So yes.
11622,I,N,T,J,Currently saving for a SC300/400- wish me luck.
11623,I,N,T,J,I’m currently watching peaky blinders and I’m on the fence as to whether or not he’s an INTJ or ENTJ- for now ill lean towards the INTJ side.
11624,I,N,T,J,"I don’t mean to sound like an ass , just hear me out:

Knowing what to do is one thing, but how to do it- that’s opening up a can of worms. 

Do you or anyone here have any tips to improve Fi and Se? Tips that one could apply."
11625,I,N,T,J,"There’s probably (unfortunately) a large number of INTJs with depression, as I too have MDD.

Yet.. It seems that I have yet to find any other INTJs that have a type of bipolar disorder. 

I’m aware that being bipolar comes with an entire slew of issues but the one in particular that causes me to stray from the norm would be when I have entered these states of “mania”. I begin to do very irrational things such as walk 15+ miles at 4am or go out and spend in a prodigal- self destructing manner. I still have so much to learn in order to overcome this."
11626,I,N,T,J,"Part of what caused many lingering issues I have stemmed from my childhood/teenage years when I was often told “you don’t know what you want, you’re a child” or “you shouldn’t be worried or thinking about X”

But even now I find myself playing catch-up to my predictions and expectations. I’d hate to be the  -I told you so-  person but after reading this you struck a note."
11627,I,N,F,P,"Purple, again. I have a lot of purple consonants in this area of the alphabet."
11628,I,N,F,P,Shade of purple.
11629,I,N,F,P,Is this supposed to look like a super disorganized eyeshadow palette? Because that's all I can see.
11630,I,N,F,P,"Don't withhold food as a ""punishment"" for binging. Eat your daily meals, whatever they may be. Restricting only makes another binge more likely."
11631,I,N,F,P,"Yeppp I'm here. My favorite difference is that our ""special interests"" tend to be more brief and media-focused, so they appear more normal to the outside world. It really made sense when I heard about that."
11632,I,N,F,P,There was a girl in my elementary school named Liana. I still think about that name a lot. It's a realy pretty name.
11633,I,N,F,P,The bold text?
11634,I,N,F,P,I know they're physically impossible but I want them
11635,I,N,F,P,"I once read kissing described as ""the slow exchange of saliva"". No, it wasn't satire."
11636,I,N,F,P,"It can be spelled either way, I think it's a regional thing."
11637,I,N,F,P,"I recommend Fantasy Life on the 3DS. It's a very relaxing fantasy world, has its own unique sense of humor, is fairly low-stakes, and the in-game time is based solely on your game play, so there's no punishment for taking large breaks."
11638,I,N,F,P,I'm a very solid INFP. I feel as if we're nearly always xNxP.
11639,I,N,F,P,Lmao why is this true
11640,I,N,F,P,"Abrosexual flag is so aesthetic, I loved it when I used to ID as that"
11641,I,N,F,P,"Hey, are you on Toyhouse? I feel like I've seen this character before, Goggles, right?

  
Edit: Never mind, apparently the person I was thinking of just used the same Picrew. Nice seeing it though!"
11642,I,N,F,P,Uhhhh one night stands exist and are a common thing in this world. I feel like a lot of people who make this argument are actually demisexual and don't know it.

11649,I,N,F,P,"Not just for doctors anymore

Edit: is it weird that I'm kinda glad people are still playing ACNL? As someone who can't afford a Switch, not even a Lite, it made me feel left out that most people have moved on to NH now."
11650,I,N,F,P,Chaotic good
11651,I,N,F,P,"I'm ""my parents never told me they were proud of me"" except they did so ??????"

11659,I,N,F,P,What does confirmed ejects even do??
11660,I,N,F,P,"No joke, Two Trucks was my first exposure."
11661,I,N,F,P,"I call the genre ""Delightfully Weird""."
11662,I,N,F,P,"Not heavy, just long :/ I'll look at that link"
11663,I,N,F,P,"Yep I do this I'll make one (1) straight character and be like ""hmm that's too limiting"" and then proceed to make them bi or ace or something"
11664,I,N,F,P,"Not saying he is, just that most girls who say ""ew"" are btches unless they have a reason. So he might just have the curse of tending to like btches. Or maybe the meme is a made up story for laughs, who knows. At the end of the way it doesn't matter."
11665,I,N,F,P,"Unless you're a mega creep, whoever says ""Ew"" is probably someone you shouldn't date anyway.

11670,I,N,F,P,No romo tho
11671,I,N,F,P,That's just one of the token straights of the group. There's an in joke that she's. a secret murderer.
11672,I,N,F,P,"See, for me that's what makes it fun. I like watching idiots, and Among Us is a casual enough space that I don't feel hurt when they rage out."
11673,I,N,F,P,"Well, it's my favorite color. The only bows that have any significance are on the last appearing ball because they have more than a couple of flags."
11674,I,N,F,P,"In actuality, it's a running joke in my friend group that she's a secret murderer."
11675,I,N,F,P,Autism Acceptance is a better name anyway
11676,I,N,F,P,The first one is probably the impostor leaving the game.
11677,I,N,F,J,"I am so sorry, that is incredibly difficult. I understand the guilt that arises when you feel like you've lost time due to pushing people away due to mental health struggles. If it's not mental health, sometimes people just get caught up in their own lives and don't spend as much time with family as they wish they did. I hope you don't beat yourself up too much though, I'm sure your brother understands and knows you care about him. Is it possible you could video chat with him? Unless he is too unwell to do that? Or maybe you could record a video message for him since you can't be physically present. I feel so badly for everyone who is unable to see/be with an ill family member due to current times."
11678,I,N,F,J,Great yellow jacket 👍 colors really complement well
11679,I,N,F,J,"What's helped me: Making true and valuable friends who I can be 100% myself with, engaging hobbies that are separate from a screen, walking every day for a couple miles, figuring out what foods make me feel crappy, good sleep, pushing myself out of my comfort zone, taking time to appreciate the little things, speaking more kindly to myself, being more vocal etc."
11680,I,N,F,J,Very beautiful 😊
11681,I,N,F,J,I think driving can be anxiety inducing for INFJs because of inferior Se 😬
11682,I,N,F,J,You have great knick knacks :)
11683,I,N,F,J,Hahaha it is 😁
11684,I,N,F,J,Pretty kitty!
11685,I,N,F,J,"I think everyone should spend some time away from their hometown (not always possible for everyone, though) to grow and gain different experiences and perspectives. I think living somewhere new can be good for you. Yes, you still bring some of your problems with you, but a fresh setting can sometimes ignite an internal shift."
11686,I,N,F,J,That's the worst feeling hahaha.
11687,I,N,F,J,Lol. I like to see it from their perspective. 🤣
11688,I,N,F,J,"I'm watching this show called The Third Day on HBO and I'm going bonkers trying to figure out all the symbolism (it's heavily symbolic). Movies and shows with a lot of that suck me right in. When I get into a new show or movie, I sometimes spend hours online looking up other people's theories and interpretations and see how it matches with my own. 😅"
11689,I,N,F,J,"Great collection. That vase is awesome, I want one."
11690,I,N,F,J,You should frame it :)
11691,I,N,F,J,It's really nice 😊
11692,I,N,F,J,Great mirror. I love the little plants on the mantle.
11693,I,N,F,J,I think you are being a little hard on yourself but I can understand why a wedding would set off those questions in your mind. I think you seem a bit worried that someone will judge you or reject you. There are many people out there who will be understanding of an anxiety disorder. If you're worried about how it could impact dating then maybe focus on your mental health treatment before trying to meet someone. You don't have to be perfect but it's reasonable to want to feel better before putting yourself out there. I was never a fan of dating apps either or meeting up with strangers for a date. I preferred to just make friends and sometimes it would develop into more as we got to know each other. I met people through mutual interests.
11694,I,N,F,J,Thank you! Your island looks really great :) I love how you arranged all your flowers. I took some cherries 🍒
11695,I,N,F,J,Slow down Judge Judy. I think people come here to vent. Where else can they do that and have others easily understand? It doesn't mean their whole being is defined by their moment of venting. Growth is important but don't get too caught up on the hamster wheel. All of those self improvement gurus are trying to make money off of making you think you have a million things wrong with you....when really humans and life are just messy and complicated. I think lots of young people post here and they're still in a stage of figuring themselves out. It will come with experience.
11696,I,N,F,J,"I can't wait to read it, I just got it from the library! :)"
11697,I,N,F,J,"Thank you so much :) I left you an acorn and some pinecones near your flower wheelbarrow near the plaza. I had fun exploring your island, it looks awesome!"
11698,I,N,F,J,It just wasn't meant to be.
11699,I,N,F,J,That doesn't seem sanitary.
11700,I,N,F,J,Beautiful! and satisfying to look at. I see people complain about how you can't find books easily when they're sorted by color but I think when you know your collection well you will know where to find them. 😊
11701,I,N,F,J,Congratulations! 😁
11702,I,N,F,J,"I gotta take a deep breath and focus before I enter those things 😅. I used to have more problems with elevators. I'd become distracted and just follow other people out, then I'd realize I was on the wrong floor."
11703,I,N,F,J,"That's a rare complication. Take your medication, eat healthy, figure out what supplements you need (some people need iron etc), watch your stress levels, get proper sleep and gentle exercise and you will be fine. Just have to pay extra attention to taking care of yourself."
11704,I,N,F,J,I can't seem to get my ferritin levels up.
11705,I,N,F,J,"I think you are being very kind and gracious here, but it doesn't sound like she was much of a friend. She treated you like a dumping ground. A true friend will care about your feelings and your need for a break from the dumping. It's insane that she thought her breakup was more important than your grief. I think all INFJs need to eventually learn to value their energy more. Save it for mutually fulfilling/caring friendships. Anything else will leave you feeling depleted."
11706,I,N,F,J,"😍 love all the color, your style is so fun and creative!"
11707,I,N,F,J,Great clock and pot! 😊
11708,I,N,F,J,So many interesting details. It looks so cozy and creative.
11709,I,N,F,J,I just read a tough one called [My Dark Vanessa](https://g.co/kgs/JShU63) (fiction) that sort of illustrates that theme.
11710,I,N,F,J,"Glad you did, they look really cute together."
11711,I,N,F,J,"It is one of those hobbies I have flitted in and out on. I tend to like story driven games the most or ones that are relaxing. I also like to use games creatively, I like customizing a character/house/landscape. I have previously loved the Sims, Second Life (lol) and I still play Animal Crossing. ""Life is Strange"" is one of my favorite story driven games. I thought The Walking Dead games were really fun too. I used to play MMOs and shooters with my partner and friends and had a lot of fun. I guess I drifted away from games because I prefer my other hobbies more. I don't really like sitting in front of a PC."
11712,I,N,F,J,"I found myself reaching for my Colourpop and Lorac Pro palettes the most. I got a Too Faced palette that I hardly touched, wasn't a fan of the formula."
11713,I,N,F,J,"I sometimes get hit with a rush of pure happiness when I am just at home relaxing with my SO and my cat. It makes me feel so cozy and content, like I don't need anything else in the world. I get that same feeling on a really beautiful sunny day. Just driving somewhere together, listening to music with those glorious puffy clouds in the sky. The destination is a pretty garden or somewhere else serene. I also felt extremely happy last year when I pushed through my panic disorder to get on a plane and visit the Pacific Northwest. I almost cried when I stepped off of the plane. I have always dreamt of going there because I love forests. When I was on the Olympic Peninsula looking at the rocky beaches, mountains and beautiful trees in the rain....I felt sooo happy and alive. My SO proposed to me on a beach in the misty rain, near dusk. Another greatest hit was when I was at my friend's wedding and all my other old longgggg time friends were there. We were dancing together to some 2000s pop music and we were laughing and laughing. Made me think of when we were younger and would go out on the town and my face would end up hurting from laughing so much. Family wise, I think about sitting around a table at my grandparent's house with my siblings, mom and grandma as we looked through family photo albums. I was also pretty happy when I graduated from college despite struggling badly with my mental health, made it through by the skin of my teeth. :)"
11714,I,N,F,J,I got to see them a couple years ago and it was amazing. I was so excited the whole time that I was practically shaking lol.
11715,I,N,F,J,That sounds lovely. It feels surreal when you are doing something you have always dreamed of.
11716,I,N,F,J,"Recently, I was watching dumb funny stuff on YouTube. I came across a livestream recording of Tom Green acting like an [idiot](https://youtu.be/7EAdW7jWRvo) in public. He was laughing super obnoxiously in front of an older couple and they were like uhh wtf. Anyways, it was very dumb but made me laugh so hard that I started crying. Then I started legitimately crying because I realized it had been so long since I had laughed REALLY hard (it's been a rough few years lol)."
11717,I,N,F,J,"I like when he reaches over and rests his hand on my leg while he's driving. He also does little things that make me feel really loved and cared for. For example, he picked up a night light at the store to put in the spare bathroom (one that I only use) and said ""now you don't have to turn on the bright light during the night!"". 😊"
11718,I,N,F,J,What a collection!
11719,I,N,F,J,It irritates me too. I was talking about my favorite books with a friend recently and I went to grab the books to read the synopsis to them quick (usually better than my choppy description lol) and none of them had one.
11720,I,N,F,J,Great blep. 10/10.
11721,I,N,F,J,"They were so shiny! I used a pre-set, I think it was KC25."
11722,I,N,F,J,"You sound like a really supportive and empathetic husband. I guess most people don't understand the condition well at all or think it's like a fake thing. I remember misunderstanding it years ago before it happened to me, I thought to myself ""they can't leave the house? how does that even happen???"". Sadly you learn how many people lack empathy for things they don't directly understand."
11723,I,N,F,J,"Proud of you too, that's a big victory!"
11724,I,N,F,J,What a beautiful way to honor his memory.
11725,I,N,F,J,"I grew up in a small quaint lake village and sometimes I really miss that type of setting, visually at least. I didn't really love how everyone knew each other's business. It got a little boring with the lack of variety too."
11726,I,N,F,J,Really like it! 💕
11727,I,N,T,J,4. Used to be 5 but 1 passed away a few years ago. 2 of them I work with so not sure if that counts.
11728,I,N,T,J,I second this. I have buried hundreds hours into assassins creed Odyssey on PC. I enjoyed it so much I have picked up more assassins creed half price on Steam to load up for when I have gotten all the achievements.
11729,I,N,T,J,"These days it hard to be alone in my home where I would prefer so you can find me trying to eek out whatever alone time I can get. Sometimes that’s solo bike rides with music to drown out other noise. Most times playing computer games on steam into the wee hours after my kids are in bed. Recently though I have reached out into multiplayer games with friends at designated times while I just listen to the banter and play some fun games. Other times just and texting and responding stuff, rethinking it, rewriting it, editing it, 2 hours elapses, still not good enough, seems awkward, delete, no reply, and off to bed! Lol

I’m a female but I’m sure this stuff is applicable to men too! :)"
11730,I,N,T,J,At least include a TL;DR if you’re going write a novel :)
11731,I,N,T,J,*sigh* ... 3 hours later...”who is this and how did you get my number?!”
11732,I,N,T,J,"INTJ Female here. I’d say be friends and try not to think about relationships. It seems like he’s putting up walls already with the comments about having other girls on the go. It would be a risky move to tell you, a girl he’s interested in, about his conquests. Being friends for a long time has value. I say let him talk. The more you do the more you will find out about the authentic him. The more you know about the real him the better decisions you will make if you decide to pursue a relationship. Maybe you dodge a bullet if he starts telling you things that don’t align with your views or style. Or maybe he’s the one and it’s great. Take your time!"
11733,I,N,T,J,This. I can spend like an hour writing something. Then edit it for the audience. Then take out stuff that could be taken the wrong way. Then try to make it interesting again with the right stuff. Then read it and think it will be TLDR. So much time has passed it's no longer relevant. Probably no one cares. Whatever. Delete. lol
11734,I,N,T,J,Nice face plant!
11735,I,N,T,J,oddly satisfying
11736,I,N,T,J,Ha! One's a boy the other is a girl. They are more likely to team up and end me instead. lol
11737,I,N,T,J,Monty Python and the Holy Grail!
11738,I,N,T,J,INTJ husband working from home. Twin minions here too since the schools closed. They try to end each other daily since clearly there can only be one! Kidding!
11739,I,N,T,J,"Female here as well. I think this is on point. When we are younger we are a bit more flexible and open, then we meet a variety of people and get used and betrayed. We learn and set standards as we get older. I for one am unwilling to sacrifice my standards for people that are flippant, indecisive, or two-faced. Finding genuine people is difficult and time consuming."
11740,I,N,T,J,I bet. Especially since we are all staying home home now.
11741,I,N,T,J,"Oh I really like Machinarium. You can get lost in that for hours. Sexy Brutale and Beholder look really interesting. I've been sitting on dead by daylight as I was unsure if I would like it. Overwatch is not a Steam game as far as I can tell, but I have heard good things about it!Thanks for the recommendations!"
11742,I,N,T,J,"I actually like all sorts of games. The ones that have held my interest the longest are Quake, Diablo, Warcraft, Starcraft and WoW. Recently I've really enjoyed The Long Dark and A Plague Tale. I just moved into Fallout 4 and The Division 2 (because it was super cheap). Ones that I will go back and forth from right now are Kingdom Come Deliverance, the Sherlock Holmes games, and the Daedelic Games."
11743,I,N,T,J,Thanks for the recommendation. This looks fantastic!
11744,I,N,T,J,"I see that. It's a good list of games. After buying games that you think will be awesome, and being totally disappointed, it's nice to have real recommendations with some weight behind them"
11745,I,N,T,J,So I actually have this one. I have played CS since like 2003 though. I used to play it at LAN Parties. I have CS GO but the people I played with before don't play anymore.
11746,I,N,T,J,Haha that looks fun. I could totally zone out playing that!
11747,I,N,T,J,I'm gonna check this one out. It seems Payday 2 is the only one on steam.
11748,I,N,T,J,"I've wanted to try this but it was getting mixed reviews saying it wasn't fun because people were cheating. If you like driving around running things down, state of Decay is fun for that. I'm gonna keep PUBG it on my wishlist! Hoping to catch it on a sale."
11749,I,N,T,J,"I looked it up. It looks pretty sweet. It doesn't look too old though, unless Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is a new one. Did you get it from steam or humble bundle?"
11750,I,N,T,J,"Why play a game? When I was younger I never felt like I had to date. I always had plenty of guy friends and it was pretty chill. We hung out together as a group and sometimes a guy would pull me aside or get me into a deep conversation and they would be interesting...until they weren’t or broke my trust. Beyond that it was always a long journey to see if someone was truly compatible. Be you and if they don’t like it then it’s their loss. The sooner you know it, the less of your time you waste on this so called game."
11751,I,N,T,J,I am married to an INTJ and we have boy/girl twins. I don’t know what they are/will be. There are no guarantees either. Children are talking emotional balls of energy! It doesn’t matter what they are. You will adapt because that child is your biological imperative.
11752,I,N,T,J,All the time. It gets annoying sometimes too. So time consuming!
11753,I,N,T,J,"I had twins a few years ago. I was on bedrest for 2 months. Probably vastly different from what you will go though. I think the hardest part for me was being so tired and low on energy.  Also, it was tiring sometimes because you want to appear to be functioning normally, even though you are in a brain fog. I think sometimes as woman we throw out some adaptive behaviors to the people around us to cover up some of our INTJ traits. Someone earlier was talking about the INTJ mask. Hormones (or double them in my case) turned into losing my patience much quicker (especially with co-workers). So that mask fell off for much of the pregnancy. All I can say is keep your partner actively involved/onboard and helping with everything that you need to do. He can help when that part of you needs some desperately needed alone time!"
11754,I,N,T,J,"Crushes rarely happened for me. It was short lived. Love is an entirely different story, takes a lot of time, and requires you to face some unalterable truths about yourself."
11755,I,N,T,J,Psychology with a minor in Computer Science/English.
11756,I,N,T,J,It's a fair question. It should be acceptable to talk about sexual health and testing before you are on the cusp of knowing someone more intimately
11757,I,N,T,J,"I love milk! Especially whole organic milk! I spend the extra $5 for 4 litres of it because the taste is just superb. I tried going back to regular milk but it just doesn't taste right. It's perfect as a snack, or when you are super thirsty, with almost any meal, and it's yummy with dark chocolate. Not to mention its a main ingredient for so many other things I love to eat! I am so glad i'm not lactose intolerant!"
11758,I,N,T,J,Bruce Lee on the Apple II. I think I was 5.
11759,I,N,T,J,"State of Decay via Steam. It was gifted to me over xmas by a friend with an extra copy. I would have payed money for this game though.

Also, Path of Exile on Steam because its free!"
11760,I,N,T,J,"I was a pioneer ""girl gamer"". The first online game I played was quake 1 and it went fantastic. It was dial up connections and voice chat didn't exist. No one in my clan knew I was a girl for a long time. When they did find out it was too late for them to change their behavior or treat me differently because I already knew how they acted normally. I still like to make the friends gaming for a while without letting on i'm a girl, because sometimes it get super weird and awkward when they do find out."
11761,I,N,T,J,"NTA. It’s one thing to support your wife by trying it or not eating carbtastic things in front of her. But it’s another thing entirely to try doing this with kids without consulting their pediatrician. Having done keto a few times with my husband I know I have to use the keto calculator every time to get the right balances of fat, protein, and carbs for my goals. You need to measure and log everything that goes into you. I just don’t see being able to do that with kids. My kids know about keto. They eat what we eat and then we make an extra side of rice, pasta, or garlic toast. They are growing and need a balanced diet including carbs. Sugar is limited and when they get more they know its a treat. With kids I think teaching everything in moderation is better then putting them on keto."

You are helping her by telling her where she can find out the info to do it herself.

11765,I,N,T,J,"I think it's fine as long as said man is not in a position of authority, and doesn't just come out of nowhere to ask for a date (because that would be weird and creepy).

11766,I,N,T,J,I had pain on my right side by my hip for a few years in my early 20’s. Was referred to a gastroenterologist who referred me to an endocrinologist/gyno. She did laser laparoscopy and I had stage 3. So everywhere it shouldn’t be. It has always been super painful. I have always taken lots of naproxen to ease the pain. Surgery helped but it doesn’t always fix it for good.

Kids throw temper tantrums all the time, and the correct thing ISN'T to just give them whatever they want (that's how you get spoiled af kids), you're supposed to take them aside, let them know they're being unreasonable, and stand firm in your decision so they learn that it won't get them anywhere and not do it again.

What you guys are doing is basically reinforcing terrible behaviour and that's why she keeps doing it - because it works.

Graduation is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for many people and is something you worked for years to achieve. This is a moment that *should* be captured beautifully. These memories are about *you*, not *her*, so don't let her make it so.

And where does it stop? Is everyone going to get upset at you for not letting her be your wedding photographer when you get married? Someone's gotta put their foot down at some point, and there's nothing wrong with that person being you."
11778,E,N,F,P,"Only you can decide if you're ready to forgive her yet.

If you're looking for other's opinions as a reference though, I personally wouldn't be able to. Someone going behind my back and lying to me for months, screwing someone I was engaged to, and to top it off it being my own SISTER? Nut-uh.

11781,E,N,F,P,"Neither. You're saying that like guys don't care what girls do. It's a very common question that both genders ask each other, so attributing it as a sign of ill intentions from one gender or another is totally broken logic. It's the first question guys typically ask me too. Oh, is it a ""coincidence"" or ""ironic"" that they do that too, or are you just full of shit with trying to insinuate something using double standards and a deep-rooted bias towards one gender?

Secondly, it's a common question because someone's job is more often than not 1/3 of their everyday life, not to mention it speaks to the person's interests, goals, lifestyles, friend groups, expectations, education. It's a good conversation starter and a good piece of information if you want to get to **know someone** in general. So unless you seriously think the only piece of information you think you get by asking someone else what they do is what their salary is, then you're full of crap with this whole line of questioning. What, you think any guy who asks another what they do too is trying to get in their pants for money too instead of, yknow, trying to be friendly and get to know you? Get fucking real lmao.

Like have you never made a friend in your life or something? It's basic small talk. Like I just can't wrap my head around how dumb this line of thinking is. Do you have some weird issues with anxiety or paranoia? Are you a conspiracy theorist? (""George W Bush has **11** letters in his name. 9/**11**. Get it? [COINCIDENCE?

11782,E,N,F,P,"Jumping on the ""this is terrible advice"" train, 

> if you are not dating at least somewhat regularly by the time you are in high school, that is not a good sign. If you're not dating by your early 20s then it's time to sound the alarm and do a serious evaluation of yourself.

Nononononono. Depending on where you live and the culture of those around you, this may or may not be common and may only apply to certain people. Just because it doesn't happen with you doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.

That being said, of course always do a good look at yourself and see where you can improve. That is always good advice regardless. But definitely don't panic or think there must be something wrong with you if you're not dating yet. As long as you're improving yourself day by day, you're well in your way.

Just to give an example of my own, in my culture and those I grew up around, dating early was heavily frowned upon. Many of them started dating near their mid-20s just fine and I see proposals and weddings popping up left and right now. There were minor groups in my high school who were dating each other, but that was by far not the norm.

Judge things based on the situation and circumstances around you. There is no hard and fast rule that applies everywhere."
11783,E,N,F,P,"Game Designer.

I make good money doing what most consider a dream job. Not to say it's always easy or straightforward, but I love my job and I know many would love to do it for much much less."
11784,E,N,F,P,"Personal preferences are cool and all the power to you for finding someone else who shares those same views.

But that's kinda ignorant to assume that just because you are like that that *everyone else* in the world is like that.

Yes there will be people like you, so there will be validation that others do also believe in that.

But there are also others who aren't. There are women who consciously choose not to marry and would rather be on their own. Who take pride on their career. Or who don't care that they are the primary breadwinner of the family. Heck many women don't even want kids. Or would rather their husband be the stay at home parent while they work... etc. etc. the list goes on.

To discount all of them by claiming they're liars or disregarding what they say and slapping your own worldview onto them like ""they must be unhappy living like that"", first is super ignorant and second, you just keep yourself in bubble with a false sense of reality as a whole. By discounting others who don't validate your worldview, ofc you're gonna keep believing you're right - *because no one can be an exception in your eyes* if you discount or assume everyone who disagrees is secretly lying.

It's like saying ""everybody likes french fries because me and everyone else I know does, everyone who claims otherwise is a liar"". No, they're not. They legitimately don't. But if you're so convinced that they do and are just lying about it to the point where you project it onto them, you're gonna have a warped worldview that doesn't reflect reality. This same analogy applies not only to this stupid french fry example, but also sexism, racism, classism, and many other everyday opinions and views.

Which is fine to an extent. Lots of people can still lead happy, healthy lives even if what they believe in isn't technically reality. Flat-earthers, anti-vaccers, conspiracy theorists still live and breathe and have their own lives surrounded by others in their echo chamber who validate them, ofc. But if you want to truly understand the world as it is, stop projecting your own anecdotal points of views onto others and really *listen* to the other side. After all, you wouldn't like it if people discounted your views and implied you were lying and secretly do like something you specifically said you didn't - so why do it to others?

You have your own life experiences that validate your points of view and it would be insulting if someone who didn't go through the same things tried to tell you you're wrong without having gone through any of it. Well others have theirs as well. Does it make you wiser to assume only one of you is correct when confronted with dissenting opinions, or does it make you wiser to accept that this person has reasonable grounds to believe what they do given their own individual life experience, even if what they believe is different?

Life is complex and everyone is unique. It's never black or white. Every individual is different. What you're preaching is applicable to a percentage of the population, but to be so aggressive in advocating that it is an applicable way of thinking to 100% of people is absolutely flawed logic and just serves to make you look like a bigot while being offensive to those that you're insinuating don't exist (""or must be unhappy!""). One man can't even speak for another that what they prefer and want in life is the same, so how does it make sense that anyone feels they are an expert enough to be so bold in making sweeping claims of what 50% of the population (that in this case you don't even belong to) want?

I write this not with animosity towards you, but to hopefully open your mind so that you can become a wiser, more empathetic person. It is with this open mind that I can disagree with what you are saying on a general level, but still understand where you are coming from and accept that it is the case in certain subsets of people (like you). My worldview incorporates that people like you, and I, and many others who may have more extreme or in-between views on this topic naturally co-exist. I don't have to put words in anyone's mouths, project anything onto them, or discredit others' stated intentions for my world to make sense.

Where this becomes not fine is when the cult of misinformation draws in enough people that it starts harming others. Global warming denial is an example. Racism towards those with darker skin is another. And sexist ideas that men have had for centuries of what women want are still affecting their freedoms and opportunities today. And this is where while I understand and hold no ill will towards you for your beliefs and I understand why some people can think that way, I would really implore you to introspect on your biases and hopefully realize to stop propagating these harmful beliefs.

I'm not going to regale you with examples from my life to try and validate my point of view in comparison to yours, because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. Your anecdotal story is 1 of many billion stories that happen every day. So would mine be. Trying to argue 1 data point with other singular data points is not conducive and doesn't do anything to gain understanding of the big picture, in the same way that no statistician worth their weight would argue something as true based off of just a couple data points.

I just wish more people would be more aware to keep an open mind as well and constantly examine their biases. The world would be a much friendlier, wiser, and understanding place if we did more of it."

It's not even about COVID. If it was she would just say she wouldn't go or mention it as the FIRST THING. That shouldn't be an excuse other people on Reddit are coming up for her for you to justify her actions with.

This is either just selfishness or she wants to push the control she has over you to make you comply with her wishes. This is reminiscent of my friends who are in toxic relationships that start with them missing hang-outs with their friends or other important things like this because of their SO, which was in the long run was really just slowly isolating their partner from their friends.

Reasonably, no-one would even entertain the idea that they the ones are being a jerk in this situation like you're doing - which is concerning because imo it points to that her making you feel bad for things when she's the one being an asshole is a common trend that you've gotten used to.

Not to say that's definitely what's happening here, but it is sounding VERY familiar."
11795,E,N,F,P,"I may get downvoted to heck for this since I'm going against the grain here, but I'm gonna advise not to let your feelings about the situation get in the way of supporting your brother.

Just because you disapprove of the situation he's gotten himself into doesn't mean you can't still show that you're there for him as a person (unless you don't even want to be, but I assume that's not the case since you said you guys are on good terms now).

His whole family has essentially turned his back on him at this point. He already knows you guys disapprove but loves this woman enough to want to be with her anyway. Just because you attend his wedding doesn't mean you're approving of the union, but what it does show is that ""I don't agree with this, but bro, I got your back with whatever decisions you make"".

If he ever runs into issues in the future, knowing there's someone who has his back will let him deal with it better instead of feeling alone. Sometimes having someone you know that has your back that you can confide in makes all the difference between being trapped or getting help.

I have been bridesmaid for my friends whose husbands I thought were scumbags. I didn't turn down being bridesmaid and boycott their wedding just because I don't approve their marriage. I went, and I did my best to give them the best day I could. Because at the end of the day I'm not there to judge their life choices - I was there because they wanted me to celebrate with them an important step they wanted to take in their life. If it works out, great! If it doesn't, I'll be there to support them through that too. But if I didn't go, all I'd be showing is that I'll only be there for them when I approve of their decisions. And if that's the case, how much of a friend am I really?"

2 months after THAT he's posting in MGTOW.

11813,E,N,F,P,"First of all, r/FemaleDatingStrategy is a toxic sub for a subsection of people with certain beliefs regarding gender not unlike the manosphere subs, so if you're basing your opinions of women from that sub then... well... yeah. Imagine if I based off all my opinion of men on the pilled guys or those who hang out in r/seduction.

Secondly, you're neglecting the fact that it's much safer for a man to step into a situation like this if the guy has already made it clear they don't care the woman is saying no. What you're essentially doing is leaving the woman alone where SHE might have to get into a risky confrontation. With a man who can overpower her.

This is why women don't WANT to start confrontations with an aggressive guy because we literally CANNOT fight back if it escalates. Regardless of where you stand on the feminism/equality/misogyny scale, it is a physical FACT that if a guy wants to overpower a girl, it's much much much easier for them to than another guy. Which is why guys like this don't mind pushing a girl's boundaries even if they say no, but will back off if another guy tells them to. A girl they can subdue even if they try to fight back. A guy they will have a much harder time to.

This is why girls will ask guys to walk them to their cars at night. There are some things we physically CANNOT handle that a guy can. We're not under any impression that ""Hey I'm a grown person and not an object, I can just tell someone no and everything will be fine!"" If we slight the wrong guy, they might come back later and overpower us. If we're alone, we might get attacked just because. We are literally scared for our safety when it comes to aggressive men, which a vast majority of guys won't ever understand and why it's hard for women to stand up to a guy, especially when said guy has already shown they don't respect the woman enough to care about their opinions to begin with. After all, if they did, they would've left after she said no the first time.

It has nothing to do with a man failing or whatever you want to phrase it. I'm in trouble. You can help. You're choosing not to. That says something about your character. You're showing your failings as a person, gender aside.

Thirdly, no your assumptions are still whack. You brought in like 3 other sexist points that had nothing to do with anything I said and went on a rant presuming them to be true of what I believe in, which was rude af."
11814,E,N,F,P,"Men can be very pushy sometimes. I'm 5'0"" and very tiny - basically any guy if they're pushy will be physically intimidating to me. And if they wanted to escalate **I literally cannot fight them off**.

Even when I'm out with friends and random guys hit on me, my male friends will step in to push them away or make sure I'm safe *because they care about me*. So if my friends are watching out for my well-being, I definitely expect that my partner should feel the same way about making sure I'm safe and comfortable.

In this scenario OP already stated that the girl said no and the guy is persisting. He's obviously not listening to the girl, which means someone else needs to step in and help. If my **date** saw this happening and just went ""welp, guess this is your problem"" - wtf mate? That's not someone I would trust to keep me safe or stand up for me, and if I can't trust someone to look out for me why would I entertain the idea of seriously dating them?

At the end of the day even if I'm capable of telling someone off on my own, whether my date (or anyone else for that matter) felt that he wanted to help me because they see I might be in trouble or just leave me alone because it's ""not my problem"" says a lot about a person. And I want someone who stands up for others in need and not just thinks about themselves, tyvm."
11815,E,N,F,P,The post specifically is asking about a situation that she told him to go away and he is persisting and trying to push you out.
11816,E,N,F,P,"That's a lot of weird assumptions you're making here which seems more a projection of your own personal beliefs than mine.

Standing up for yourself or someone you care about is very reasonable to expect of someone. For example even my friends would stand up for me if someone was being pushy or intimidating with me. I also personally stand up for my partners when they're being mistreated. If someone hits on your date in front of you, you are being disrespected and whether you stand up for yourself (I never said fight - I said **stand up to them**) essentially shows me if you are someone who lets people walk over them in life or not.

I personally don't. I don't let anyone disrespect me, my friends, or my partners and you damn well know that I will stand up and tell someone off if they do. And I expect my partner to do that for me and the people he cares about too.

So to address your weird assumptions that I'm some sort of misogynist hypocrite against my own gender:

1) I don't expect guys to fight each other for me. In fact I find physical violence very unattractive.


2)

> but just don't say elsewhere that guys should be able to be emotional and vulnerable in front of their partners, or complain about them being closed off, because you'd be a hypocrite.

Giving you the benefit of the doubt that you mean to say ""shouldn't"" instead of ""should"" here - yes of course men should be able to be emotional and vulnerable in front of their partners, and I've always advocated for that. And considering this has nothing to do with this topic at all but you felt the need to bring it up shows **your** insecurities around this.

3) I have no preferences to whether someone is physically strong. The men I date tend to fall more within the category of ""nerds"" because I find intelligence someone's most attractive quality. That you imply these aren't ""real men"" are your words, not mine. Which like I said speaks more to your own views/expectations of gender and insecurities that you bring it up, because I would **never** even think about them that way to even write those words down.

You're the one showing the red flags here. All I said is I want someone who will stand up for me *and themselves* when they're being disrepected **in the same way that I will for those I care about**. **You're** the one who took that and somehow felt justified in going off on a sexist rant about certain types of people not being ""real men"" and women being ""objects"". Like holy crap dude, if you wanna talk about red flags...

Guess any guy can talk down to your parents or siblings and you'll stand by and watch because it's not ""your problem"" right? If you have a wife, a guy can be physically assaulting her in front of you and ""well it's not being done to me, the onus is on her to resolve it"" am I right? By that logic if you leave your sister alone with a guy she's obviously uncomfortable with because, ""it's on her to handle it"" and she ends up getting raped, that was on her because ""she's not an object she could've stood up for herself"" right? Ugh."
11817,E,N,F,P,"If my date doesn't step in and intervene when someone is clearly disrespecting him, I'd personally be turned off and not go out with them again.

Like what, you just gonna sit there and take it? You're just *letting* a rude guy walk all over you? You see I'm uncomfortable and you're not standing up to defend or help me and just letting me deal on my own?

Nut-uh. Not a guy for me.

---------

**Edit to clarify because for it seems some people aren't getting my point here so I have to elaborate:** At the end of the day even if I'm capable of telling someone off on my own, whether my date (or anyone else for that matter) felt that he wanted to help me because they see I might be in trouble or just leave me alone because it's ""not my problem"" says a lot about a person. I want someone who stands up for others in need and not just thinks about themselves, tyvm. I have stood up for **myself, my friends, and my partners** when I see someone mistreating them, and I expect my partner to be someone who does the same for me **and others he cares about**. Not to mention HE is definitely being massively disrespected by this stranger right now too and he just doesn't care?

In this specific scenario OP posted about, the girl has already said no and the guy clearly doesn't care and is trying to push her date out of the picture. This is a very intimidating scenario, and women will know that if you say no and a guy doesn't listen, it's very dangerous because guess what **men can easily overpower you**. If my date just went ""oh well, your problem not mine"" here that's very selfish and shows that he doesn't care about my well-being. Especially when in most cases like these they would listen if another guy steps up and tells them off. You'd be literally letting the girl be in a dangerous and uncomfortable situation because you don't want to say no to help her out when in turn you're expecting her to have to *keep saying no to a guy who is clearly not listening*. That's fucked up, and I stand by that if that happened that there is no way in hell that guy would get a second date with me.

It's not uncommon that even girls in public are accosted by pushy men who don't get the memo, to the point that girls have come up with the strategy of *pretending to know the girl in trouble so they can butt in the conversation and push the guy away*. So if even girls are looking out for this happening and to help strangers out if necessary, fuck off if you're a guy in a position to say ""no"" and resolve the situation immediately but choose to do nothing and watch me struggle."
11818,E,N,F,P,"It's truuuueeee there's so many fish pics!

Makes it easy to filter out guys I wouldn't like though hahah. Any guy who is so proud of their fishing they post pics of it ain't the guy for me (I don't do hiking/fishing)."
11819,E,N,F,P,Oh... fuuuckkk...
11820,E,N,F,P,"No. Do your best, always, no matter what anyone tells you *even if it's a parent*.

I don't even know what to say to this situation that isn't completely insulting to your mother because reading this post made my blood boil with its idiocy."
11821,E,N,F,P,"Eeehhh some of the stuff on there is pretty cringey and has an undertone of misogyny though. That's why I frequent r/dating to try and help people and not r/seduction. r/seduction is like the smarmy r/dating for ""pilled"" people who talk about things using pilled terms or talking about pick-up artist tactics. It's just gross.

Reading that sub just gives me a bad feeling like I'm surrounded by slimy people who just wanna ""game"" social interactions to get laid..."
11822,E,N,F,P,"Personally I've never had a problem with dating ever and I frequent this sub to try and help other people understand dating more or give (hopefully useful) advice to people who legitimately need it.

I'm sure I'm not the only one of the nearly 400k subbed here that are here for that reason, though I'm sure we're in the minority."
11823,I,N,F,P,"Yeah it does. Seeing stuff like this makes me feel like I’m lesser or have shitty taste or something because I happen to be attracted to men. This post gave me biphobic vibes and I’m not into it. 

It starts becoming not about making fun of shitty men, it’s making fun of bisexual women and bisexuality in general which is wayyyy too prevalent in the LGBT community."
11824,I,N,F,P,"Yes absolutely do not do a dna test through 23 and me. There’s no laws protecting dna privacy which means that it’s very likely that insurance companies will start discovering high risk people for diseases they can’t control and deny them health insurance! If you need help figuring out which medicines are going to help your psychiatrist can do a dna sampling through a more trusted, professional, medically-focused company that will be done through your health records and stuff so it will remain private. I’ve had that done but I won’t touch an ancestry or 23 and me test until I start seeing restrictions and regulations."
11825,I,N,F,P,"I think you’re totally right, just talking with a few people on this sub I feel really validated, especially talking about early embarrassing and teen/tween experiences I had, to learn that my genre of embarrassing was pretty standard among aspies and most of us have had some sort of really embarrassing event around 11-13, made me feel much better. I would get you some lactose free ice cream!"
11826,I,N,F,P,"Just leave lol. Nobody wants you here. We don’t owe you a debate simply for existing. Also I said nothing about “the person”? I was talking about a situation. Comparing acephobia to transphobia, homophobia and biphobia is sooo not fair. Abstinence and chastity is literally seen as a virtue, extremely high and holy in most cultures. We get stoned to death and shunned for our sexuality and gender identity. Also it’s kind of wayyyy harder to be an under the radar trans person or bi/gay/lesbian, compared to just being ace (assuming the person is not aro, but even then. Still). There’s a big difference."
11827,I,N,F,P,"Aw thanks. Everyone is so sweet on this sub, whenever someone talks about struggling or not having friends this is always people’s reaction. Really great to see tbh. Also same, but I prefer ice cream."
11828,I,N,F,P,Yeah. And the fact that I never know what I want and don’t want to do big grand things (I turned 18 a few weeks ago and my mom wanted to take me to the ocean and rent like a fancy airbnb and asked me about bringing a friend...I have no friends...)
11829,I,N,F,P,This thread I swear to god. You overlook something by mistake once and suddenly you condone and actively support pedophilia!
11830,I,N,F,P,Literally the best explanation I’ve heard so far on this. Thank you.
11831,I,N,F,P,"I don’t, I feel left out lol"
11832,I,N,F,P,It’s actually my favorite. I feel very safe and comfortable in a turtleneck. Has to be good material though.
11833,I,N,F,P,Exactly. And what really bothers me is how so many people just completely fail to see how biphobic this is. Like everyone doesn’t think we’re all sex crazed freaks already.
11834,I,N,F,P,"Exactly. I grew up with (and STILL EXPERIENCE) an incredible amount of biphobia and transphobia pertaining to the pansexual label. It was seriously presented to me as “woke bisexuality” or “I’m attracted to the personality, not the gender/genitals uwu” (ew) or “I like men, women, and trans people”. And I often feel like I’m being asked to completely forget this. Pansexual is just not having a gender preference. Stop saying it’s attraction to personality. That’s incredibly biphobic, would y’all say that about gay/lesbian people? What about biromantic asexuals?

And even if I don’t have a gender preference, I don’t have to start calling myself pansexual, ya know? Rectangles and squares."
11835,I,N,F,P,Damn who isn’t attracted to Natalie tbh
11836,I,N,F,P,"I feel both older and younger than my peers constantly. I feel like I’m probably more introspective and thoughtful than a lot of them, but I also am quite a bit younger than them in other ways I feel like. Took me two years to learn how to drive even remotely safely (I’m still eehhh about driving in the car alone) because of sensory overload and processing speed. I am very uncomfortable with dating and romantic relationships when almost everyone I know wants it really badly. People tell me that I’m “super smart” sometimes but I have a hard time applying this to the real world and even school (for example, I was my AP bio teachers favorite student because I was incredibly inquisitive and proactive when it came to content, but I had a very hard time being consistent, showing up to class every day and handling the workload sometimes)."
11837,I,N,F,P,"Ok well, this is for *exclus* bisexuals. So if you don’t share these opinions, it’s not really for you."
11838,I,N,F,P,"Honey, need I remind you you’re on r/battleaxebi? An exclus subreddit? If you don’t wanna get your mspec feewings hurt I’d suggest going somewhere else. This isn’t your space."

11842,I,N,F,P,"^This. When we lose someone to themselves, we are often so wrapped up in the one time that we couldn’t help them (understandably) that we can’t see the countless times that we helped them push on just a little more."
11843,I,N,F,P,Yes. My dad does this too and my family hates him for it haha
11844,I,N,F,P,Like being flooded by people who don’t belong here. People who come here just to downvote and disagree
11845,I,N,F,P,"Ok nice stick man. No I’m not going to “take them out of shelters” I simply said that they aren’t LGBT. Why do you want them to be LGBT so badly? Y’all have your own community. It’s the same as Intersex people not being LGBT. They might be a gender/sexual minority but they’re not LGBT. Laws group us together because the distinction doesn’t matter to governments.

People don’t disown their child for being asexual. I’ve literally never heard of it. Ever. If it happened to you I’m sorry, but that’s not because you’re LGBT. It’s because your parents are abusive. Bottom line: if there are no Supreme Court decisions explicitly deciding your rights, you are not “oppressed”. You can walk through your life and not have to tell anyone that you are asexual. Your sex life is your own private business. I don’t have sex either! Guess what? Nobody knows or cares. Nobody has to know that you’re asexual? However, your gender identity or actively being attracted to others is not something you can hide.

Corrective rape, again, is an abuse (and usually a sexism) problem and not an “ace” one. The Trevor project is meant for LGBT kids, but other GSMs are free to use it? Nobody is telling them they can’t? 

I’m not going to be stoned to death in dozens of countries for NOT having sexual attraction to anyone. However, I WILL be for sexual attraction to women, as a woman. Think about that before you go on your next oppression olympics marathon."
11846,I,N,F,P,Oh I know the “piper meaning” all right. That’s why I don’t support it 💕
11847,I,N,F,P,Brigading a subreddit that isn’t meant for you 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
11848,I,N,F,P,The preference is a lack of preference. So yeah it’s a preference.
11849,I,N,F,P,Is this subreddit being brigaded or something?
11850,I,N,F,P,Uhh no. It’s a preference of bisexuality. Preferences are not sexualities and people need to stop treating them as such. We don’t have “sexualities” for being attracted to specific races of people right? Because it’s a preference and not a sexuality.
11851,I,N,F,P,Pan sympathy 🤢🤢🤢
11852,I,N,F,P,Ace people aren’t LGBT unless they are trans/nb or are bi/lesbian/gay. They are a sexual minority but not LGBT. There’s nothing wrong with that.
11853,I,N,F,P,"I wish I could go out at night like you described, I don’t feel safe doing so as a young woman. I really understand what you’re saying about preferring the nighttime. I get really irritated when other family members in my house stay up late and make a lot of noise (my sister tends to do this a lot) because nighttime is the one of the only times I feel true peace. 

Aside from that, shopping sucks. It’s way too bright and there are often really strong smells and it can be super loud. Noise cancelling headphones can help a lot, and sunglasses (even indoors) for lights that are way too bright. Wearing a hoodie or a comfortable sweater makes me feel more secure when I’m finding going out more difficult than usual. Wearing masks definitely helps with the strong smells and it’s normal with the pandemic now. Besides that just giving yourself breaks. If you can do your shopping at multiple smaller stores to allow yourself breaks rather than one large store that you end up staying in for long periods of time. Go at less busy times: Sundays, weekdays (besides fridays) and in the morning especially. Try to ignore others (still be polite though) and focus at the task at hand and doing a good job at it. Don’t put yourself down if it ends up absolutely sucking and you hate it. There’s nothing wrong with not liking to go out very much."
11854,I,N,F,P,"Thank you. I needed to hear this. My friends and I were talking about how probably the worst thing in this situation is the shame I was taught to feel for expressing my emotions in an atypical way— vocal stimming and rocking/pacing being big ones that make me feel embarrassed, because I was taught to perceive this as childish and inappropriate. Also hyperfixating on the matter and having it be the only thing I talk about is really making my family hate me lol. I realized from a young age that these inclinations that I had often made others perceive me in an unwanted way and so I started masking a lot and still do quite a bit, but when I’m really upset I just can’t anymore. It’s like I _have_ to."
11855,I,N,F,P,"It’s ok that you made this mistake. Stuff like this was drilled into my head from a young age and I’m excellent at masking but I understand lol.

Also there are multiple ways to be smart. You might be smarter in a certain way than they are, and vice versa. But it’s generally not a good idea to talk about intelligence levels. It can get very offensive very quickly."
11856,I,N,F,P,"Scored 152 on the RAADS-R. Huh. Should I try to get this tested? Every time I’ve suggested ASD to my therapist/etc they’ve always said something like “but you’re so empathetic” or “I don’t think so” but I had a giant meltdown this afternoon (lots of rocking, loud vocal stimming, and pacing. It was embarrassing and horrible) after my laptop broke and now I’m more convinced than ever."
11857,I,N,F,P,The room is fine except for the pan flag lol
11858,I,N,F,P,Is [this drawing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/iup2b5/undertale_5th_anniversary_toriel_art/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) inherently sexual to you? You should really re-evaluate how you view female bodies. Characters can be drawn curvy with large breasts and not be inherently sexual. You’re objectifying. Also goats do have boobs lmaooo. Toriel is not an animal. She might as well be human because she has mental and emotional capacity of a human adult.
11859,I,N,F,P,"Dude did you not see my comment? She’s a HUMANOID. She walks on two legs and has hands. She a goat humanoid. And it’s pretty sexist that you think that large breasts = sexual. I had large breasts at age 12, and that was the mentality that had me sexualized as a child! The same one you are using right now. Sorry but this is a shit take. Toriel is curvy :)"
11860,I,N,F,P,"Why is it weird lol. She’s a humanoid. I actually really appreciate that people tend to draw her plus size/curvy, it makes me feel a lot more secure in the way my body looks. Also big boobs do not have to be inherently sexual. I love drawings of toriel where she has a large chest that are sfw."
11861,I,N,F,P,"I really wish that we can have mainstream gender neutral honorifics in English one day tbh. It’s great to call someone sir or miss, but there are places where we really need a gender neutral term like for letters and the phone or just meeting someone."
11862,I,N,F,P,Mfw the little girl in grave of the fireflies dies from starvation “food review”
11863,I,N,F,P,"I agree with you, but I also want to point out that you left out hormonal intersex and I believe that it should be included! People with hormonal intersex conditions sometimes have abnormal genitalia and sometimes don’t, but both definitely experience intersex discrimination either way (for example, being forced to comply with HRT even if they don’t want to). I have a friend who is ftm transgender and also on the hormonal intersex spectrum, luckily this is kind of to his advantage given his gender identity! But yes I do believe that the term intersex should be reserved for those with a body/tissue/organ/hormonal thing."
11864,I,N,F,P,"Oh honey. You’re totally valid and I’m so sorry. You’re not crazy. You might feel this way because you’ve been brought up to feel like emotion is some sort of illness, but you are the healthy one. You are the one with a beautiful soul. I’m so so so sorry. I am also a 17F with a narc sibling....it’s so hard. Luckily she does not hurt animals, or hasn’t yet at least and I don’t have to be nervous about her hurting my bird. If you want to talk I’m here."
11865,I,N,F,P,Bruh.. you’re an adult in ur 20s? You might be younger and less experienced but still an adult and capable of making your own decisions...
11866,I,N,F,P,"Exactly. This is how business works. I’m not a fan of this girl and it’s not my thing, but she has every right to stream and take donations from men who want to fawn over her online. I don’t think that I could do it personally, but only because I get overwhelmed easily by attention and affection. Otherwise who cares. It’s a way to make some extra money and maybe have some fun. As long as you’re not being a total and utter complete piece of shit like that invadervie chick, it’s not a problem?

These men are adults, they need to learn how to handle themselves. These women are under no obligation to look out for them. It’s a business and they’re just trying to make money like anyone else 🤷‍♀️"

11869,I,N,F,P,Oh yeah you’re a gatekeeper for wanting HRT to actually be taken seriously and not wanting trans men to be fetishized 🙄🙄. These people I swear to god
11870,I,N,F,P,"“Gatekeeping” Jesus fucking Christ. Ugh. 
If this person wants to go on HRT solely for bottom growth, than yes, it is some sort of sexual thing, and if they absolutely do not want any sort of side effects then they need to not be seeking out HRT because that’s virtually unavoidable.

Regardless of this person’s gender identity (I’m not saying that they aren’t a boy/man), it sounds like theyre only interested in clitoral growth and absolutely nothing else, which is a sexual fetish. This is the kind of thing you see people online (mainly cisgender women) talking about how they can achieve bottom growth through stuff like DHT creams, which a doctor will absolutely not prescribe for that purpose as far as I know, because it’s not just “oooh it’s making my clitty bigger” even if you’re not experiencing any side effects, it’s extremely sketch and possibly dangerous to others around you. If the cream residue stays on your hands or clothes or sheets or whatever, a pet, partner, child, friend etc could absorb that and it could seriously compromise their health and comfort. This is a big reason why I try to advise against T creams when possible. It’s really hard to coexist with others and use topical t creams (patches not included because the area is contained! Patches are a great and safe option) because one little slip up and suddenly your girlfriend or dog or little sibling has absorbed a bunch of testosterone because you didn’t wash your hands well enough, because you washed your guys’s clothes together, or because of oral sex, etc etc. 

This person is CLEARLY not taking HRT seriously at all and it makes me sick. They should direct their questions at a fetish body modification community, NOT an FTM Facebook group 🤦‍♀️."

However, it carries more weight if a white person does blackface than vice versa because there’s a long history behind it that goes back to slavery. There was a specific kind of ‘comedy’ that was widespread from the 1830s to even the early 1900s called minstrel shows, where white people would apply blackface and imitate slaves. This is a quote from the Smithsonian: 

“The first minstrel shows were performed in 1830s New York by white performers with blackened faces (most used burnt cork or shoe polish) and tattered clothing who imitated and mimicked enslaved Africans on Southern plantations. These performances characterized blacks as lazy, ignorant, superstitious, hypersexual, and prone to thievery and cowardice. Thomas Dartmouth Rice, known as the “Father of Minstrelsy,” developed the first popularly known blackface character, “Jim Crow” in 1830. By 1845, the popularity of the minstrel had spawned an entertainment subindustry, manufacturing songs and sheet music, makeup, costumes, as well as a ready-set of stereotypes upon which to build new performances.”

Whiteface, on the other hand, doesn’t have such a history. That’s why blackface is a bigger deal.

11990,I,N,T,J,"Yeah. I think people on this sub take MBTI way too seriously sometimes. Of course it’s a widely used tool, and a really interesting theory, but your MBTI type does not DEFINE you. Nobody can just be categorized into one cut and clear set of characteristics, and even if that were the case it doesn’t justify behavior. 

Although I have no idea where you saw people doing that unless you’re talking about some random meme or throwaway comment on here. It’s the internet, man. People say dumb shit that they wouldn’t say in real life."

Genre: Contemporary fiction
Word count: 200
Type of feedback: General impression

It was three in the afternoon, and the sun shone a pale hue off of 22-year-old Mark Gneet's apartment building, through his bright green curtains and all across his evenly folded bed. Mark's room was tidy as well as compact, the door to his tiny kitchen only a few feet away from his aforementioned bed. His kitchen seemed to blend in with his living room. If you could call it a living room, that is. The more appropriate description would be a lamp, a soft gray couch, and a decently-sized television. Next to the couch was a storage closet, and next to the storage closet was the second bedroom, in which his younger sister Elane slept. Their rooms were quite similar, save for Elane's curtains, which were a dark and velvety red in contrast to Mark's.
It was three in the afternoon, and Mark Gneet would be working another shift at the framing store downtown. Elane would be returning home hand-in-hand with her boyfriend, whose existence her brother was unaware of. The discovery of the two would startle him, but it would be nothing compared to the man who showed up at their door an hour later."

12024,I,N,T,J,"Them. Simple as that, they have passive aggressive humour. They belittle you and have a superiority complex. I rarely laugh with them. Their only jokes are the ones who are made about your physical appearance or what you like. I rest my case."
12025,I,N,T,J,"Same, since I was a kid. Especially when my family argues and ends up being physical, I think in my head, that I have choices and should do something. But I don't feel like the situation is real, I don't feel anything, I don't really know what to do. So I just let my instincts do whatever, and I end being physical too. Idk, I just became more violent these recent years. I never really told my mother, I just told her ""What if this is a dream inside a dream"" and stuff like that. I don't really feel safe at all when I express my feelings around her so I just don't. It has always been like this and it's driving me nuts. And it doesn't help when my feelings are invalidated and ignored. In conclusion, yeah, I relate to this when I'm under a large wave of stress and adrenaline but I don't know what it is. It happens quite often actually, I just brush it off."

12028,I,N,T,J,"That's the majority, but I can find girls like me. I usually interact with who I like and they just stick to me. I don't really have friends in real life because I'm anti social and I can't really express myself properly. Anyway, but I have friends online who share almost the same views as me. While it's true, it's not a strong bond but it's a good bond. You said smart women avoid talking about deep, intellectual topics, but are they really that smart? That's the question you have to ask. Or be straightforward and just ask them ""Why don't you ever talk about other topics, like, idk art or politics?"". If they're that smart, they shouldn't be afraid to answer, but if they get defensive or offended, then you know, they're not that smart as you think. That's my opinion tho, I can't really tell you a lot, I'm a teenager but I observed my female peers and my mom's sisters and friends. I can tell you tho, that smart girls aren't afraid to talk about other topics, my classmate was really trying to bond with me. We're just friends now. But she is smart, both in school and outside of it. So, yeah, that's kinda my opinion, I can bond with both genders, but I tend to incline towards boys."

12041,I,N,T,J,"I don't know, man. I usually fake my mood when I want attention or want to make someone be in a good mood that I like (i.e. friends or my mother). Yeah, it feels like temporary happiness and then I feel super drained. That's my way of dealing with it or, I express myself physically, either alone or with someone (mostly alone). I'm quite aggressive because that's how I feel but I repress that feeling and it ends up being worse(I'm working on that on my own, big yikes, I know).

I guess, you could do little things to show how you feel.

Wrting, music, art, poetry, maybe even programming or sculpting, riddles or paper craft. You choose it. Don't fake how you feel like me  'cause it will make you tired. Usually people are very receptive so if you do small smiles or some type of face, they will know how you feel. Just don't overwork yourself. And do it when it's necessary. I am not so sure about this tho, so take everything you read with a grain of salt.

Good luck!"

12064,E,N,T,P,Good friend.
12065,E,N,T,P,My INTJ brother was the unintended star of his preschool program. Now does improv.
12066,E,N,T,P,"My husband is ISTP, and he’s like a completely different person socially. His voice is warmer, he’s jokier, everyone thinks he is so laid back and chill. At home he lets down his general disappointment in humanity. 😂"
12067,E,N,T,P,My ISTP husband turns into a brand new person around new people. :D I think it's pretty common. Sometimes when you see someone and think they are being themselves - they aren't.
12068,E,N,T,P,"Yeah - based on all you did together and what he told you, he was probably deeply in love with you and terrified in his own right about being hurt. The best advice is to listen with an open heart. He didn’t mean to hurt you. He didn’t know or understand your boundaries. If you talk to him and share them, he will respect them. But don’t assume he will know them. That is my top-shelf advice from an ENFP married 9 years ISTP. Don’t assume - open up and tell if you want him to better understand you."
12069,E,N,T,P,"Married to ISTP; experience with INFJ. Strong emotional reaction will make them withdraw because don’t always understand what to do next in tough emotional situations and they are problem-solvers. He probably felt pretty rejected, maybe even wondering if you thought he was a bad person. 

If you shut down the potential to problem solve together , it’s a stalemate. Both partners’ feelings are equally important in a relationship, even if yours are strong. His are strong too, he just doesn’t express them the same way. Good luck - hopefully he messages you back!"
12070,E,N,T,P,This explains why my cat is obsessed with my Allbirds.
12071,E,N,T,P,"My ISTP husband says we get along, and I don’t give him problems for smoking weed. 😂 Mutual toleration seems to be one of them keys to our marriage."
12072,E,N,T,P,"Married one! 😂 The key is not to overthink it. If they like you, they will want you around. That’s their highest compliment. 

I’m very independent and love alone time. If you are an ENFP who loves PDA and a lot of emotional affirmation, this may not be the match for you. We struggle sometimes with communications issues. But we get over them quickly too. I love that he fixes everything and we each never tire of researching new things. Knowledge whores, that’s what we both are. Just for different topics!"
12073,E,N,T,P,What is that? I might need it for his Xmas list!
12074,E,N,T,P,That’s good to know - I drive a 2017 Suburu.
12075,E,N,T,P,My ISTP believes you can never have enough flashlights. I like the self-defense ones.
12076,E,N,T,P,"I’m glad, because I married him!"
12077,E,N,T,P,"It’s tough but very doable. The best thing going for us is we both love our independence and alone time, we have a lot of common interests, I have a great group of intimate friends that I can blather on about Ne/Ni concepts, and we love each other. Communication and understanding is key. MBTI has actually helped me a lot and likely helps that we are older. But the independence thing is very key for both of us - that’s not always an ENFP thing but it’s important to me."
12078,E,N,T,P,He will not talk about it first. He’ll rather show than talk. Just go do something fun together so he can show you.
12079,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, I’d probably ask him out or see if he wants to hang out. :)"
12080,E,N,T,P,"That sounds really promising to me! Mine would go out of his way to talk to me and ask questions. They really like to do things together - can you ask him to go on a socially-distances walk? Maybe geocaching? 

Also, seems to me like ISTPs could give two craps if they are being dry in chat unless he cared what you think and if you are enjoying yourself. The fact that he is even bothering to chat with you speaks volumes to me."
12081,E,N,T,P,He gave me some little brass pointy thing for my driver’s side door to punch out the window should my car careen off into deep water.
12082,E,N,T,P,That is so hilarious - he mentioned to me that the i3e took a AAA battery. I think he was trying to explain that as part of its value 😄
12083,E,N,T,P,He makes me cutting boards and pen cases for Christmas :)
12084,E,N,T,P,"Yes. He loves these flashlights (he collects them) and he knows I liked the clicking mechanism on the larger one, and the clip, so he gave me that one plus the other one because it goes on a keychain. Think of ISTP love as “my interests + my thoughtfulness of you = acts of service, gifts and quality time”"
12085,E,N,T,P,Not his Olights. These were an act of affection.
12086,E,N,T,P,We have found they are also good for mood lighting.
12087,E,N,T,P,He’s obsessed. Every time they have a collectors sale he loses his damn mind. 😂
12088,E,N,T,P,"Done. Married in 2013, ran off to the courthouse. 😊"
12089,E,N,T,P,"Does he want to spend time with you? Do things for you? Then he loves you. ISTPs would rather be alone many times, so if he wants you around it’s love."
12090,E,N,T,P,He did. It’s a pink Spyderco. 😄
12091,E,N,T,P,"He hated the baby phase. Doesn’t like messes or loud noises. Really likes spending time with them now that they are little people. He teaches them a lot and thinks about what toys and activities would peak their interests. I do sometimes have to remind him that they are kids, not small adults - but he has a lot of empathy and love for them."
12092,E,N,T,P,I told him after the second kid.
12093,E,N,T,P,And good luck - hope it goes well for you both
12094,E,N,T,P,"My ISTP asked me out, I moved in 3 months later, and now 9 years and two kids later he’s turned my basement into wood shop, indoor garden, 3D printing station and of course, flashlight collection repository. 😂"
12095,E,N,T,P,Bike lights would be awesome!
12096,E,N,T,P,"This definitely doesn’t sounds like a personality thing specifically. This sounds like resentment and unhealthy communication. I realize we are only getting one side of the story, but I would have a real heart to heart with him about your relationship, what is bothering each of you, and if you can communicate your needs and grievances before they get to the blow up stage. If not, we’ll..."
12097,E,N,T,P,"Naw, it’s familiarity bias. ENFPs are the only ones hanging around in your orbit, so they seem like the most abundant. 😂"
12098,E,N,T,P,"I didn’t learn this lesson until later in life, but there are two things you can do - 1) Put a lot of effort into others’ birthdays and hope the universe returns the favor or 2) treat yourself like your own best friend and throw yourself your own party/special day. Or both! If you are doing #1 and it’s not happening for you, focus on #2. Plan the very best day you can for yourself and invite people to be part of it. That’s what I did this year and I loved it! Hugs, I really do understand your hurt. 

Also - how do you accept compliments and gifts? I’ve only just realized that maybe I do it a little awkwardly and it may not send the best signal. 😂"
12099,E,N,T,P,That sounds like unhealthy behavior - what usually precedes these episodes?
12100,E,N,T,P,"Oh yeah, yikes. It was a real dark time."
12101,E,N,T,P,I think ENFPs are natural diagnosticians. It comes from an innate ability to observe the pattern and the open mind to pull it in the right context.
12102,E,N,T,P,"Southern Midwest in USA! Nutty weather, but I love it 😂"
12103,E,N,T,P,I’m here for the INTJ circle jerk - please continue!
12104,E,N,T,P,I freakin love to talk about the weather. It always changing where I am!
12105,E,N,T,P,"[yaaaas queen](https://images.app.goo.gl/D6T59kzgxbb6h4rE9) 

Go get yourself your very favorite take out and turn up the best-worst pop music in your library. The embarrassing stuff. Now put on lipstick and dance in front of the mirror. You free, bitch, freeeeeeeeee!"
12106,E,N,T,P,"I will second talking with others. I (ENTP) get so excited when my INFJ bestie really gets into his passion project. Honestly, being very excited and vulnerable about something I love or
Love about others’ is one of my core traits - open up to friends and let them coax you out of your head. Think of all the famous INFJs who built fantastic teams to help them get their visions implemented. Trusted friends and supporters can encourage you along the way. 

Also, take a lot of walks. That seems to work for me and mine."
12107,E,N,T,P,Yes indeed! You should see an ENFP/ENTP mom’s kid birthday party. It’s a little extra. 😄
12108,E,N,T,P,"Observe and figure out who they are at their core - they acknowledge it to them. People who I feel understand me are few and far between and I stick with them for life. Otherwise - can't speak for us all but intellectual stimulation, adventure, space, attention, sex and understanding for when we inevitably screw up. Challenge us to be better, and recognize us along the journey."
12109,E,N,T,P,"90% of my emails/chats with my INTJ friend end with me going, ""Why do you think XX?"" It's not a challenge; I'm genuinely interested in how you came to that conclusion/observation. Last email he ended with, ""The election is going to be very, very close."" And I'm all, ""AND! AND! DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING BRO! ESPLAIN PLEASE!"" 

INTJs underestimate our bottomless, unquenchable desire to take a stroll inside their head. Not for manipulation, but to come along for the ride."
12110,E,N,T,P,"When I see other types discussing ENTPs and all they say is “too argumentative, good for a laugh” I wonder if they’ve actually ever befriended a true ENTP. Because I rarely argue with my friends - but I ask a hell of a lot for the sake of clarification. Distillation is one of our best traits."
12111,E,N,T,P,"True, making fun of others for sport is not cool. Here’s some dark humor - my dad has advanced liver cirrhosis and picked out the urns he wants us kids to use. Three stainless steel flasks with his alma maters’ logo on it. Told me just to superglue the lids. It will certainly be a conversation piece as to why I have an SEC team flask displayed on my mantle. 

But I’m thinking I should probably order another one so I can swap mine out and take a big swig to f*** with my brothers."
12112,E,N,T,P,How does one teach him to say compliments? I’m genuinely interested in learning this Hogwarts wizardry.
12113,E,N,T,P,That is literally a dad joke.
12114,I,N,T,J,"I’m not going to say you shouldn’t do it because at the end of the day I can’t save you. Only you can. You’re 16. You have years ahead of you to find yourself and become who you want to be. You also have years to find the person who is meant for you. In case soulmates exist, maybe wait a little longer for that person. You don’t want them to be alone, right? How about the recipes and stories you’ll one day share and tell? You must tell them! You need to, so maybe wait a little longer to one day tell them. And don’t forget the people you have and will one day impact. You can’t leave them on the edge of their seats waiting for the time that you saved them from making a mistake. Just like I’m here to tell you not to do it. I may not know you, but I do love you. And I know that maybe even if the people around you don’t, you’ll one day soon get the people who love you around you. Travel the world first before you end it. Make sure to complete everything your heart desires before you call it quits. In the end, you only have one life. Even if you do decide to end it, I will pray that you get everything you wanted down here up there. I love you, stranger, and I wish you’d love you too. (But it’s okay because you don’t have to always love yourself.)"
12115,I,N,T,J,"This makes too much sense. Part of me wants to disagree, but the part of me from two years ago says that you’re completely and utterly correct."
12116,I,N,T,J,I wish I could be unhappy in peace without someone asking if I was on my period.
12117,I,N,T,J,Happy birthday!!! I hope you have a fabulous and beautiful day. I recommend getting donuts or cupcakes as a treat :)
12118,I,N,T,J,Thank you!!
12119,I,N,T,J,Also how does the blue “INTJ” thing pop up?
12120,I,N,T,J,Oh okay!!! How you’re describes me quite a bit as well. Thank you!!
12121,I,N,T,J,"I get that, but I have had times where I strongly thought someone liked me when they didn’t. I think it was because one of the guys was already very extroverted and flirtatious. I also wish to be direct with that, but it’s annoying when people won’t allow you to be direct."
12122,I,N,T,J,They really said “This you?”
12123,I,N,T,J,"Is it bad that I’m an INTJ, but I don’t respond like that? I have an immense feeling of guilt if I am rude to others even though I also have a strong feeling to reply that way."
12124,I,N,T,J,"My cousin said I try too hard to be nice, but it’s true because in my head is the second one even though I say the first one."
12125,I,N,T,J,That’s quite interesting!! I read up on how we tend to prefer directness which is pretty spot on. I think we tend to pick up on a lot of social cues better than most even if we aren’t perceived as “social” people.
12126,I,N,T,J,"Oh wow!! I thought he knew you liked him, and he never communicated with you. I would say be straight with him on your intentions and feelings completely. Also try to do an exercise where you both say how you’re feeling that day. Try to open up more on how you’re feeling, so that he feels comfortable expressing his. I assume you are a loyal individual who won’t do anything to harm another person, so please make sure to make that clear with him. It’s okay to say this every now and then as a reminder that you will always be there. INTJ’s HATE liars!! Please also stop with any small talk which can cause us INTJ’s to lose interest, so please just dive into whatever. I think you would better be able to communicate over video chat or in person (if allowed)."
12127,I,N,T,J,"If he doesn’t talk to you, he probably doesn’t like you. We are pretty forward, and we aren’t into “hints”. Maybe be a bit more forward with him, and see where his head is at as well."
12128,I,N,T,J,"Please don’t avoid eating in order to lose weight! It can turn into a really bad e##ing disorder! Try to seek advice to a medical professional, so that you can get what your body needs!! I wish you all the luck and love."
12129,I,N,T,J,"Interesting. I like red velvet cake, but the thought of it makes me have a weird taste in my mouth."
12130,I,N,T,J,True! It’s so weird to dislike an animal unless you have some trauma.
12131,I,N,T,J,I pray for the best.
12132,I,N,T,J,"Just ask him directly, why?

Why are people so afraid to talk to an INTJ like a human. We won't bite your heads off, at least not at first."
12133,I,N,T,J,When did the yard stick go out of style?
12134,I,N,T,J,Doesn't happen... I said... It doesn't happen.

I'm sorry. Sorry that you are ignorant and stupid. Stop crying. You are 5!!"
12136,I,N,T,J,Still trying to contemplate the figures.

12148,I,N,T,J,I need to see how someone is before I go ngage. Like are they needy? Does their voice annoy me? Does she say stupid shit constantly? Must vet
12149,I,N,T,J,"You have to negotiate before the ride. If you want more than a thank you like gas money. You must inform them. That's the best you are going to get. 

I know people don't do things because they are kind. They n ed something in return so I always intice first ... Like 5 dollars for a ride. Of they don't want it. Then I'll call Uber. First person was more.cinvienent because they were just there at the moment."

12151,I,N,T,J,I was going to ask for a home video. Recent. Wanted to see what she is like before I make my decision to say hi.
12152,I,N,T,J,They actually touch themselves in class and don't want to scream out their own name.
12153,I,N,T,J,"Ni-Se gathers weird shit in. 

Then Fi is asked... Do I like this weird shit....

If Fi says true, program continues and Te takes over.

If Fi says no, it's purged immediately.

When Te takes over, that's what we show to the world how we took the information in and structured it and now we are going to ram it down your throats because it's a good idea and everyone will benefit from it."
12154,I,N,T,J,If you said frasier. Ill be on that like flies on shit.
12155,I,N,T,J,"Ohhh... Let me tell you what they can do with that free government money. 

I think they should run the poor like they are at boot camp. Have the base run the mess hall and housing. They go out to work and st the same time they will achieve an education. Once education is achieved. Head of houee .hold can go into the working world. Having people decide what to do with housing and food stamps on their own is not efficient."
12156,I,N,T,J,I am an INTJ and my ego bubble protects me from down pores.
12157,I,N,T,J,INFJ are a lost caused. Look at what happen when someone turned down an INFJs landscape portrait.
12158,I,N,T,J,You have meet your father. He's the guy that your mom introdues as the long time friend.
12159,I,N,T,J,Exploit the daddy issues with the Ni-Te. Tell her that she is going to end up dating her father.

So we have to only unpacked thing that doesn't require any floor space. Anything that can go in kitchen will be fine. 

Then had to move my sister out if th house and into an apartment and had to push everything thru for that to be done. So basically swapped houses in one weekend.

I had to find a creative way to move things without any help. Because fat and lazy adults are useless.

I dunno I just feel that if I wasn't there then nothing gets done and regular people have no direction unless someone in there with Dom Te (intj close enough) pushes everything and everyone to do their job and do it efficient"

12196,I,N,T,P,This sounds awesome! I’ve looked into some number theory before but it never really caught my interest. I’ll have to take a look at this book!
12197,I,N,T,P,"I read the book [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW_2017-09-04.pdf) by Sergei Treil . I was able to read it with just having taken high school algebra. It’s designed to be a first course in linear algebra, but it is proof based. So if you just want to learn how to do computations there are probably better books to use, but if you want proofs this is a great book.

I also know Khan Academy has a linear algebra course that is mostly videos. I have watched some of the videos and they seemed good, but I didn’t go through it fully so I don’t have much to say about it.

Another resource is a YouTube channel called 3 Blue 1 Brown has a made a series [essence of linear algebra ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). These a wonderfully animated videos that provide a lot of good intuition."

They would just be joining the meeting on a phone to see their work and a laptop to see them. I’m sure not everyone has the resources for this but it might work out.
12200,I,N,T,P,"Related to this point, it’s important not to judge people based on spelling/punctuation. Things like learning disabilities or learning English as a second language can make these things much harder for some people. Not spelling things correctly or putting commas in the wrong places is NOT an indication of someone being less intelligent.

That said, people will judge you about these things so at least try."

12202,I,N,T,P,"I’m interested in math but I really don’t want to be grouped in with those kids who memorized the quadratic formula before every one else and now think they are the smartest person alive.

12214,I,N,T,P,"First of all your mental health is the most important thing so don’t let working on math effect that at all.

If you do want to work on math, khan academy is a great resource (and it’s free)! I used it to make sure I had all the fundamentals down really well. What I did and what I would recommend, is starting with the most basic math class they have. Go through the tests and if you miss a question or just don’t know to do something, watch the videos and then go back to the test. It might surprise you how much you do remember and how fast you can pick things back up. 

In addition, make sure your enjoying it. Going through fundamentals is not the most fun thing to do, so find some things that are fun and don’t require much previous knowledge. YouTube channels like Numberphile and 3 Blue 1 Brown are good. Math puzzles are also fantastic and can help you with learning it!"
12215,I,N,T,P,"If you enjoy it, then it’s not a waste of time. 

Most hobbies have don’t have an end goal that has any significance. People who like drawing, draw to improve their skills and for their own enjoyment. Playing an instrument as a hobby is to get better at playing that instrument. Doing math as a hobby is to improve you skills and for you to enjoy.

I would say that even if you don’t have any end goal, doing math can be useful. Just working on exercise will help you be a better problem solver in all parts of life. Having the ability to teach yourself is something else that is applicable to many parts of life."

12232,E,N,T,P,"I am the opposite. Debating is a process and in a way small talk for ENTPs. You have to break it down. Comment on the parts, validate correct parts and/or concerns. Dispute or offer alternatives where suitable.

It shouldn't be adversarial.

I*FP can be scary to face sometimes, because they become cross and might bottle it up. As an ENTP I would much rather someone spit it out. I tend to just avoid discussing sensitive topics with them, if they are not close friends.

Just my experience :)"
12233,E,N,T,P,"I'm the opposite. Haha. I assume people are ten steps ahead when I start explaining.

I have to remind myself to build up the explanation like I am at work. But in casual conversation I want the other person to feel at ease, and don't want to sound patronising."

This problem is much more deep seated than censorship can deal with."
12235,E,N,T,P,"You dodged his last point. Controlling speech is bad.

You lay yourself bare, and good and bad speech becomes up for debate. Not saying it's a problem in some of the countries today, but principles that act as democratic frameworks are important. You can't just make exceptions without potential consequences. Liberty is often taken bit by bit.

Videre må man redusere fotavtrykket sitt på nett med å se på fingeravtrykket fra nettleseren og telemetri fra apps.

Man bør ikke akseptere tredjeparts cookies og slette cookies etter man har lukket en tab. Man må blokkere alt av Google. Ha en ny container hver gang man åpner en tab. 

Bruke Linux. Blokkere tilkoblinger via host-filen i OS.

Jeg anbefaler en egen nettleser der du er offentlig, altinn, NAV, nettaviser som ville ha registrert samme unike fingeravtrykket uansett. Denne ble uansett ikke akseptere tredjeparts cookies, og være beskyttet via trinnene over. Ha split tunnel på denne, slik at du bruker din offentlige IP og ikke kan sette dette i sammenheng med VPN serveren. 

Dette kan kun redusere fotavtrykket ditt naturligvis, men det er mye mye bedre enn det 90% av mennesker holder på med.

Om man holder på med noe veldig sensitivt, så kan man lage en Tor-tunnel inne i VPN-tunnelen din. Da kan ikke ISP se at det er Tor-trafikk, som ser mye mer suspicious ut enn en VPN."
12249,E,N,T,P,"Om man virkelig er i søkelyset siden de vet hvem du er og mistenker deg for noe, så er det veldig vanskelig å skjule sine aktiviteter.

Når det kommer til å operere slik at man unngår å legge igjen spor som man kan sette i sammen, si 1 mnd etterpå, så er det mye enklere.

Uansett så syns jeg grepene man tar er mer for å redusere et unødvendig stort avtrykk på enkle aktiviteter. Om man er kriminell er første skritt å ikke legge igjen avtrykk whatsoever, er man først mistenkt for noe veldig alvorlig så blir du nok tatt til slutt."

Det som skjer er at selskapet betaler selskapsskatt, så betaler eier utbytteskatt. Videre så kan man med en beskjeden formue og fem ansatte se at formueskatten spiser formuen din bit for bit om man har magre år. Pengene er skattet mange ganger fra før. 

Er du en steinrik arving ville jeg flyttet pengene offshore. Jeg skjønner det ikke er moralsk riktig, men tror ikke forslaget er så radikalt som mange skal ha det til. 

Du må se formueskatten i kontekst, det er ikke slik at inntekter ikke skattes på. I verste fall må man selge ned eller sparke ansatte for å kunne betale privat formueskatt.

Ang. det å ha flere i arbeid på grunn av formueskatten, så er det ikke slik at det er bra for alle på langsikt at folk blir, om man kunne I stedet effektivisert eller fått pengene til å vokse bedre en annen plass. Den ""andre plassen"" vil da ha behov for ansatte, enkelt sagt.

Nå har jeg ikke lest rapporten, men vi må ha et godt skattesystem som holder motoren, som er markedsøkonomien, gående. Velferdsstaten skal være et system finansiert av det. Staten skal ikke skape en sosialistisk økonomi."

I was going to do ISTP next because of the boundless ideas I had for that character, BUUUT I felt like I wasn’t representing the functions as well as I could while keeping elements of the original design, so I’m scrapping it for now. Lmk if there’s any ideas that any of you feel could be nicely implemented!

Anyways, the main inspiration for this character was a post describing Ni as ideas leading into one main connection. I depicted that in my drawing with the gems and gold wire leading to that one big gem on INFJ’s forehead, which was also a way I was able to tie in male INFJ’s staff with the whole character. I also wanted her to come across as someone who cares deeply for the wellbeing of others, and so I tried to give her a soft, kind look but I’m not so sure I succeeded.. maybe next time I do a Fe character! :)

For the clothes, I was inspired by the male avatar and did my best to fix it up to fit the specific character.

Anyways, I’m going to practice more self discipline and do my best to pump more of these out!"

Well, ignoring the fact that humans ARE animals, the fact that I have to dumb down my point for you because you are unable to pull context clues from text is telling.
Animals understand that other gay animals are beneficial- you do not.

>Going astray from your natural form and destroying laws of nature.

See my argument from the first reply incase you didn’t get it the first time, which you clearly didn’t.
But even then, while we’re at it, why don’t we destroy these advanced manmade structures? All in the pursuit of keeping the laws of nature in order?
While we’re at it, forget about agriculture aswell, because that’s controlling the natural food supply!!

And why do you think pedophilia will take over? Genuinely curious, I wanna see your thought process because MY, that’s a leap if I’ve ever seen one!"
12315,I,N,F,P,">Are these so call sexualities normal?

Yes. Same sex coupled animals in nature play a very important role of basically adopting any younger animals that have been left behind by their biological parents. Sound familiar?

>Was the natural human reproduction system made for the same sex?

The great thing about modern technology, is that there are ways to get around this.

>Is pedophilia a sexuality?

Everyone says fuck no, because it is not a sexuality. Most people that are LGBTQ+ don’t consider pedophiles to be a valid sexuality... because it’s not. But you’re not entirely concerned about that, are you? You just are homophobic and you need a reason to be because otherwise, people won’t put up with your bullshit."

With respect to those who think differently, I'm not sure I care that much.

If voting for a third party actually affected the results enough to where they would win, I would definitely be voting for them, but if I do then I don't have a say in what the real election is about: Republican vs. Democrat.

12485,I,N,F,P,"Oh my god, this was like reading my own life lol. I'm a 9w1 and my bf is also a 5w6. What you said about emotional manipulation is so true. Sometimes he says something that I find offensive but he thinks is completely rational, and then interprets my crying as emotional manipulation when in reality I'm just crying as a knee-jerk response to what he's said.

Also the whole thing about crying when people argue is accurate for me too. To add, when my bf or someone I'm close to gets angry suddenly (e.g. road rage, something not going right) I get very stressed out and sometimes even cry because I find it overwhelming, spontaneous and out of character. However, I suppose it's somewhat hypocritical for me personally, as, although I want to maintain peace and harmony between me and the ones I love, I can be very a emotional person and am prone to sporadic mood swings myself."
12486,I,N,F,P,"What's with all the hate for this cover (despite the obvious CA thing)? I personally think it's better than A and D, which everyone else seem to love, as it feels more fun and cool, and gives the girls different individual styling. (So What era had enough black and white, uniform styling already for me.) The lighting and arrangement of colours on this pic are also spot on 👌 I too thought it looked quite photoshopped when it was released, but it looks so much better in HQ. Each to their own ig 🤷"

12488,I,N,F,P,"Yeah this is more an Fe or maybe 9 thing tbh. INFPs are unlikely to make up different personalities, but instead only show a certain amount of their true personalities to certain people; e.g. I'm a lot more comfortable and confident in being myself around my bf compared to colleagues. But as a 9 I'm very agreeable by nature and can sometimes come across as passive to people I'm not close to."

12512,I,N,F,P,What a mess
12513,I,N,F,P,For sure there is a correlation between ADHD and Ne. Both descriptors are overlapping to an extent.
12514,I,N,F,P,She has so much wasted rap potential 😭
12515,I,N,F,P,"omg these were exactly my thoughts after watching the MV, so glad you've posted this. The MV felt very exploitative and sexual just for the sake of queerbaiting for more hype and views. They would NEVER risk doing this with two male idols. I hate how girl on girl action is so fetishised when lesbianism is not a fetish at all - people can get hurt by such depictions ... I think the popularity of Bad Boy def played into the inclusion of those scenes."
12516,I,N,F,P,"Jaden was for sure the 'mastermind' behind it. People on here hate him for one reason or another, but to me he was a true visionary to have developed such an intricate and in depth story and world. It's a shame cause the lore was one of the big reasons I got interested in loona. Butterfly was a big let down for me in that respect (though I loved the choreo and sound), and I wasn't a fan of So What :( doubt we'll ever get a return to form, but I'm glad they're gaining more popularity :)"
12517,I,N,F,P,"I mean if you wanna focus on your mental health and avoid being in the public eye rn, why you pushing videos of yourself into the public eye? Seems kinda hypocritical on Jae's side? I need to look more into it tbh"

12519,I,N,F,P,omg I relate to all the unhealthy INFP traits to a fucking t 😭🙃🔫
12520,I,N,F,P,"Agree mostly. Singing and doing hard choreo is fucking difficult, and there has def been a very obvious shift of focus from singing live to harder choreo in the K-Pop scene generally. (Whenever I watch trainee shows I'm always surprised how many of them can't actually sing lol.) But I personally enjoy hard choreo, even at the expense of average or below average vocals. You can play the song in the background but you can't fake the dancing - it's what everyone sees. When you know a group can sing live cause they have done so without doing choreo, it doesn't really bother me that they don't sing/sing well while doing hard choreo."

12527,I,N,F,P,"Love the energy of the verses and chorus but I don't like the pre-chorus personally lol, it kills the hype vibe it was building up and feels really misplaced :("
12528,I,N,F,P,"It's very obvious she is trying to live up to her ""God of variety"" title people give to her. There's no doubt she can be very funny (for me her humour is best when she isn't trying to force out a joke or funny dance). But you can tell she isn't the most natural comedian and finds it awkward but has to do it to fulfill her role in the group. I sympathize with her, I can tell she feels an immense pressure to be funny (as she has often been referred to as the least talented member) which, if anything, stunts her real natural ability to be funny"
12529,I,N,F,P,Jimmy Fallon laugh
12530,I,N,F,P,"That encore yikes.. you can tell their voices are strained af and they're scared to sing live

Tbh I actually think Twice as a group have generally gotten a lot better. To name a few, Tzuyu has gotten a lot more confident with her voice and is relatively stable, and Dahyun can actually hold a tune. If you watched from their sixteen days it's obvious that JYP never intended for them to be a 'vocal' group - only Jihyo, Nayeon and Jeongyeon (and maybe Chae and Sana) could sing loudly and still be stable. The rest were below average. Now though, I'd say they're all average (excluding poor Momo) which is fine cause they're not known for being live powerhouse vocalists (compared to the likes of mamamoo for example), they're known for their image, their personalities and their brand. What does sadden me is how nervous and scared they are so sing live.

Momo is the worst example. In the encore vid she honestly sounds just like her voice in the MV, it's a horrible sound regardless. In the vid you can tell she just can't sing in that atrocious, annoying voice they force from her, but they won't let her change it now because it's what she's known for. I'm really worried she'll ruin her voice from forcing it :(

It all comes down to: what makes a K-Pop group? Is it vocals? Dance? Song? Image? It all really depends on the person watching. For me, although I'd love to hear them all sing comfortably and confidently, I don't care if they can't sing amazingly live - nor does it matter to JYP or a lot of their fans. In spite of their combined lack of vocal talent, Twice have nonetheless become one of the most popular gg in South Korea.

Also, looking at the comments to the encore vid, this opinion isn't that unpopular."

When we engage in altruism, we get a hit of dopamine, and that feeling is addicting, and that motivates us to give more, but that’s not replenishing. Truly replenishing activities aren’t meant to motivate you. They’re meant to recharge you. They’re not meant to make you feel good in the moment, but they are meant to make you feel much better overall. 

Things like napping, working out, eating meals on time, hanging out with people who give to you and not just take from you, and being okay indulging in what they provide. None of these activities are supposed to make you feel good about yourself, but they will make you feel more secure, stable, and in control. They’re meant to recharge you enough so you can engage in the activities that do make you feel good about yourself."

Lakers Depth Chart:

|**Position**|**Starters** |**Bench**|**Reserve**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**PG**|LeBron\*|Rondo\*|Quinn Cook|
|**SG** |KCP\*|Caruso\*|Dion Waiters|
|**SF**|DG\*|Kieff|JR Smith|

|**C** |Dwight\*|JaVale||

Heat Depth Chart:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**PG**|Dragic\*|Nunn\*||
|**SG** |Jimmy\*|Herro||
|**SF**|DRob|Iggy\*|Solomon Hill|
|**PF** |Crowder (normally plays SF)\*|Derrick Jones Jr\*|Chris Silva|
|**C** |Bam\*|Olynyk (normally plays PF)|Meyers Leonard|

**\*elite defender**

Lakers' entire starting 5 can get in the passing lanes, crash the boards, protect the rim, and shut opponents down in the perimeter. Their only weakness is a speed mismatch on their bigs, in which case they can sub in 2 elite perimeter defenders off the bench.

Heat have to hide two of their main scorers (Robinson and Herro) on the other team's less skilled players on offense, and LeBron knows how to exploit those matchups. They could sub out Herro and DRob for better defenders like Nunn, Iggy, or DJJ, but that would hurt them offensively. Nunn is a ball dominant volume shooter without good percentages. Iggy on offense is a great complementary piece who knows how to space the floor and make the hustle plays, but he's a very streaky shooter and his minutes are limited due to his age. DJJ is an intriguing player who is great at cutting and rolling, and has about as good of a 3 ball as Iggy, but is still pretty raw offensively.  

On top of that, the Lakers have an arsenal of offense-first players off the bench who can get them buckets in bursts (Kieff, Kuz, Waiters, Cook, Dudley), which the Heat don't have."

I think he often gets what he should do and what he wants to do mixed up, because he has this idea of what the ""right thing to do"" is (in this case, stay loyal to Kierstan/Laurel even if he's not into them and respectfully break off with them when there aren't any other girls in the picture), and that often gets in the way of what he really wants deep down."
12628,E,N,F,P,"He's not honest with himself though, which by default means he's incapable of being honest with others. He chose to not pursue Lauren when he wasn't even feeling Kierstan, and he's doing the exact same thing with Lakeyn and Laurel."

12630,E,N,F,P,"Point Guard: Westbrook is nowhere near the other guys. I'd put Dennis Johnson, Walt Frazier, and Gary Payton over him. For the 10th spot I'd probably go Gary Payton because of how much he revolutionized how small guards play defense.

Shooting Guard: Great List. Some honorable mentions: Pistol Pete Maravich, Sidney Moncrief, Joe Dumars, Mitch Richmond, TMac, Vince Carter. I'd probably have TMac over Gervin.

Small Forward: Melo and Paul Pierce are nowhere near the other guys, and Kawhi's career is still a bit young. I'd have Rick Barry and James Worthy over all 3 of them, and there's an argument for Dominique Wilkins over them too.

Power Forward: Pretty good list, but Giannis and Pau Gasol aren't in the same conversation as those other guys. There are a lot of guys I'd put above them: Chris Webber, Bob McAdoo, Dave Cowens, Jerry Lucas to name a few. I'd put Webber and McHale over Elvin Hayes tbh, and I can see AD making this list before Giannis does.

Center: Dwight Howard doesn't deserve to be mentioned with these other guys. Some people you left out that I'd have over him and maybe Walton: Robert Parish, Patrick Ewing, Willis Reed, and Wes Unseld."
12631,E,N,F,P,"Hold up, can someone explain to me how Lakeyn was being an inconsiderate bitch when literally everything she was saying was 100% warranted? 

1. Carrington was not honest with himself about his feelings for Lakeyn, and that led to him leading on both girls

2. If he really did like Laurel, he wouldn’t be putting her through that 

3. He did make Lakeyn look like an idiot because there obviously was something there that was stronger than what he had with Laurel and now he’s acting like he likes Laurel more

4. Lakeyn is happy with Bennett because from her perspective Bennett is actually honest about pursuing her if he’s into her, and that puts him over Carrington in her book.

P.S. this isn’t the first time Carrington has gone against his feelings to play it safe, he should have ended things with Kierstan to pursue Lauren

The dude needs to stop being so goddamn wishy washy when it comes to his priorities and own it if he actually sees something more with Lakeyn, because what he did was dig himself into an even bigger hole and at the end of all of this he’s gonna be the one looking bad.

Also it doesn’t help that Laurel is delusional in thinking things will work out with him. He doesn’t pay any attention to her or give her any signs that he’s actually interested in her, yet the girl is committing 100% to a guy who keeps giving her signs and signals that he’s gonna dip.

It’s takes like OPs that lead people to be less honest with others because they value some false idea of “politeness” more. That’s a toxic message to be sending to everyone, because it will deter people from actually holding others accountable for their actions and advocating for themselves. And let’s be real, Lakeyn did nothing wrong to deserve Carrington’s treatment towards her."

12743,I,N,T,J,"Honestly, I'm swamped with work but I'm intrigued... this might very well be a shit show but... let's find out..."
12744,I,N,T,J,"Well I don’t see how you’re being manipulative here. As long as you’re not passive aggressive in your day to day interactions with people, I’m fine. Though I would also say that being passive aggressive only shows that you’re weak and scared, and can do no other than take someone’s shit. The mature thing to do would be to talk it out with them so they know what they’re doing wrong. Of course, I know most INTPs are conflict averse so maybe wouldn’t be as willing to figure it out with someone, but maybe that gets improved later on in life. Not sure."
12745,I,N,T,J,I definitely have an inferiority complex lmao. I realize I’m not more intelligent than others... but perhaps more hardworking? I don’t know. Definitely something more common in INTP/INFP behaviour despite not having the same cognitive functions.
12746,I,N,T,J,"That’s a pretty self deprecating way to look at it haha. My point is that I appreciate you all whether you’re dumbasses having a smart moment, or being smartasses. This, of course, if you don’t have toxic qualities like passive aggressiveness/manipulative tendencies. 

I myself find it difficult to understand my emotions, and find it even more difficult to talk about them. Having more life experience well most definitely bring out the ability to understand your own feelings :) it’s a long process"

12759,I,N,T,J,"Right, because of Ne... that would make sense. Most of my friends are either INTPs, ESTPs, ISTJs, or ENFPs."
12760,I,N,T,J,"I see what you’re saying now, fine I’ll give you that."
12761,I,N,T,J,"Oh yeah, I can definitely relate with “things she did in the past, said she would not do, but still did”. I don’t think that’s a personality/cognitive function thing, though it very well might be.  Sorry to hear you had such a rough experience man"
12762,I,N,T,J,"Ohhhh, my bad. Yeah I get that. It's like the whole awkward vibe. I think it's cute, but that's probably a preference thing. Thanks for sharing man"
12763,I,N,T,J,Fuckin magic.
12764,I,N,T,J,"Yeah eh? Well, looks like *someone's* agreeing with me so as to disprove my statement that they would disagree with my former comment ;) No matter, it's cute."
12765,I,N,T,J,"Haha, cute."
12766,I,N,T,J,"I'm sure people know of the existence of the word ""melodramatic"", but choose not to use it because melodrama has connotations of overly emotional (which I don't see at all). If you mean in the sense that INTPs overdo things, I can see that for sure. Preferences, I guess. Thanks for sharing buddy"
12767,I,N,T,J,"Considering most people say that about INTJs, this is news to me. You do you man, thanks for sharing"
12768,I,N,T,J,"Yeah I do especially like them as friends, and I find them to be addictive in the platonic sense. Their odd quirks and boat load of knowledge are always a joy to pass time with. I personally adore ""little"" and ""weak"" people (virgins are great imo but that's an individual thing) but I don't know if that's an INTP think in general (literally anyone can be a virgin)"
12769,I,N,T,J,Reading this made my night
12770,I,N,T,J,"Depends. Perfect is a subjective word, everyone has their own idea of what perfection is. Something that is “perfect” or flawless to me, might not be perfect for you!"
12771,I,N,T,J,Hahaha not sure what you’re alluding to
12772,I,N,T,J,"That’s sweet, love to hear it!"
12773,I,N,T,J,"Hahaha, I enjoyed reading this and you definitely got a giggle out of me in the end. Thanks for sharing.

I definitely agree with the apparent differences between INTP and INTJs. My good friend/old teacher and I had a shared interest in a topic and had very different reasons for why we were interested in that topic. We would also come to drastically different conclusions on how to solve a specific issue. I just always found my old teacher’s thinking so fascinating. 

As for attraction—I think that once I’ve established a friendship with an INTP, there’s no chance of that friendship developing into anything else. But if I had a fling with an INTP right off the bat, that’s the only way an INTP wouldn’t be in the friend zone lol"
12774,I,N,T,J,"As in, you only get insanely addicted to ENTPs?"
12775,I,N,T,J,"He has that INTP laugh and silly joking style, seriously I’m going to be binging these videos so thank/curse you!"
12776,I,N,T,J,"Yeah, INTPs are well-liked as far as I’ve seen. I’m  sorry that you feel like you push people away. I think a lot of INTJs can relate to that feeling so it’s often a good commonality or conversation piece to start a friendship with"
12777,I,N,T,J,"Yes, I am."
12778,I,N,T,J,"Does he give you your quiet time when you ask? I find my mates always do when I ask, they’re cool with it."
12779,I,N,T,J,Have you typed them by cognitive functions? I find a lot of INTPs are mistyped as INTJs and vice versa on online mbti tests.
12780,I,N,T,J,I did not know that name before but now I do and I already like him. Thank you
12781,I,N,T,J,I'm sure they'd appreciate your presence! Hope you ended up befriending one.
12782,I,N,F,J,You should look into polyphasic sleeping. The uberman and dymaxion cycles allow you to collectively sleep for just 2 hours everyday.
12783,I,N,F,J,I'm sure any type can given the right circumstances.
12784,I,N,F,J,u/VredditDownloader
12785,I,N,F,J,This is REALLY awesome dang now I kinda wanna try something like this
12786,I,N,F,J,Thank God I didnt get sakura
12787,I,N,F,J,"Well if we're gonna be technical the picture is wrong. His left side only had 2 lines when he gave his left eye to kakashi, now there's several. Furthermore there should be visible scars under his right eye area even though most of his face is covered in bandages here."
12788,I,N,F,J,"Not necessarily their wing unless I really get to know them. But yes it's a very useful tool if you take the time to learn. For me 8s, 3s, 7s, and 2s are the easiest to type because there usually the strongest personalitys. once you meet several people that your certain are the same type you start to notice those very traits across people you meet. If I were you I would just really read up on how each personality acts and try to figure out people in your life who may or may not be that type and make mental footnotes when you get to know someone. Connect the dots and you shouldn't have a problem typing someone. Although some are certainly more obvious than others lol"
12789,I,N,F,J,This knowledge will allow me to live my best life. You see if you can learn to type someone you then understand their basic desires and fears. You will know generally what to say to make them like you and hate you. You can understand a part of them that they may not even be aware of. If everybody knew ennegram we could all at least understand each other and make the world a better place. but mostly I really find this shit really interesting! Never have I felt understood until now
12790,I,N,F,J,Unfortunately I don't know enough about Edgar Allan Poe to make an educated opinion however I do generally trust the ennegram institute which says he's a 4. If your so convinced he might be a 5 then hes probably a 5w4. Then again what do I know about the subject. Ive just always found the ennegram institute to be most accurate.
12791,I,N,F,J,Nice nice
12792,I,N,F,J,Why do you think you are? Do you just not want to appear volnurable to others or are you doing it for yourself because I've met plenty of people who associate emotions with weakness. Although I don't think it is a weakness as long as your not to much of a burden to others. I've always admired people who can place yourself themselves in others shoes and ask yourself if what you say will weigh them down. mentally of course
12793,I,N,F,J,Yeah I understand your probably right. I've only had one close friend that I had trusted enough to open too. Honestly I don't really know if it's a good idea to open up to faimly for most people. Even if there blood it seems everyone goes behind your back now and again except for mother. Idk maybe your faimly dynamic is different than mine. Or maybe we're all just really unhealthy lol
12794,I,N,F,J,Lol what's worst is the people who put astrology in the same category as enneagram and Myers Briggs. Yeah I said it. Fight me.
12795,I,N,F,J,Wooow I never noticed this. I'm entirely confused now lol makes no sense
12796,I,N,F,J,Right lol
12797,I,N,F,J,Fair enough
12798,I,N,F,J,Lol been said before I'm gonna say it again. Shoulda went straight to the hidden leaf and took his other eye back.
12799,I,N,F,J,"Yeah this makes the most sense. Wish kishimoto touched on this spiritual stuff a bit more. Religion too. It's just kinda confusing because you have Madara saying he was sleeping the eternal sleep and then you have the grim reaper, then the king of hell,  and then Rin and Obito making out in heaven and lol. And then he kamuied himself into kakashis body? Like what?? maybe he's just trying to be inclusive of all religion lol"
12800,I,N,F,J,quite the meme lord lol but yeah don't worry your good hard to imagine anyone finding this offensive
12801,I,N,F,J,"Yes this is perhaps one of the more logical explanations. kakashi shouldn't count because unlocked his susano through some weird spirit transfer where Obito entered his body somehow so maybe it technically wasn't him who unlocked it?. And despite all the mangekyo Obito Potentially got his hands on, he was never able to pop one in and unlock his susano? Could be on to something"
12802,I,N,F,J,Is this original meme? If so we'll done
12803,I,N,F,J,Very accurate however being perfectionistic and struggling opening up to others is not a flaw. I'm sorry I don't mean offense but in this world opening up to people you barely know is incredibly foolish.
12804,I,N,F,J,Me 3
12805,I,N,F,J,"In the general sense that the government should stay out of things I suppose I am more libertarian however most of my values are very conservative. But then again I don't think I pay enough attention to politics anymore to have a valid opinion. I don't know if I even care anymore. Far too sensitive man, everytime I look at that stuff it ruines my day. I'm terrified of becoming polarised like so many around us. Not for me man. I know I should care but the toxicity and negativity of discussing anything political really gets to me. What do I care. I don't. God even my opinion sounds so polarized lol. Have a good day"
12806,I,N,F,J,Yes she had great leadership qualities however she was by far the weakest hokage
12807,I,N,F,J,I've never even heard this stereotype before lol It's nothing to do with if your intuitive or sensor. Anyone who doesn't believe you have at least some control over your own destiny is a fool. It's clear people are really taking their myers Briggs type too dang seriously. Don't take what you hear to heart.
12808,I,N,F,J,Templarkiller lol your name suits you well
12809,I,N,F,J,The one with the cross is the king right? Maybe it would make more sense if the entj was the queen and intj the king. Idk just an idea
12810,I,N,F,J,"Nice, nice"
12811,I,N,F,J,Only sith deal in absolutes.
12812,I,N,F,J,Haha true yeah. As long as he keeps pumping out quality music I'm not complaining.
12813,I,N,F,J,Haha lol yeah I'd watch that
12814,I,N,F,J,Might as well throw episode 5 in there while your at it
12815,I,N,F,J,Haha yeah I understand. It's only natural to perceive really bubly pure enthusiastic people as disgenuine. And that likely is the case with alot of them. But idk even if they aren't that genuine or hiding something I still really appreciate the positive energy and being around them.
12816,I,N,F,J,"Perhaps my Se is very developed Because I would surely consider myself a very enthusiastic and eccentric person at times. Around people I am comfortable with anyways. But yeah it's really interesting you feel that way because I would go as far to say I generally feel more comfortable around very pure enthusiastic people, it seems they are always the ones that open me up."
12817,I,N,F,J,"Yeah a defense mechanism, secrets like layers to protect me. But I also think i just find it genuinely satisfying to have secrets that only I'll die with. Purely."
12818,I,N,F,J,I will do what I must
12819,I,N,F,J,u/repostsleuthbot
12820,I,N,F,J,Jesus I'm too young to be giving advice don't listen to me haha. Just do what you feel is right I suppose.
12821,I,N,F,J,"I know the feeling all to well. 18 infj M. I transferred to 3 schools because of how misunderstood and disconnected I felt from everyone. Even when I was at a nice school with my best friends I just felt so disconnected and misunderstood. In the end I just ended up dropping out because at the end of the day all I ever wanted to be was a self employed artist. I've spent the last year in my head locked in a dark room. Reality is far more confusing and slippery than it should be. I am seriously considering deleting all my sm as well. It's just so toxic and ends ruining my day but if I delete it I won't be able to contact the few friends I have. Haha I almost wish I grew up in a different time as well away from whatever this is. Maybe the early 2000's? I just really enjoy alot of that music. My point is having dominant intoverted intuition combined with being highly sensitive really is a awful combination. We are on a different wavelength from most everyone. This world was certainly not made for people like you and realistically i think this is something your going to have to learn to live with. My best advice is what you've already done. Delete sm, cut out toxic people, surround yourself with positive people etc. you seem to be walking the right path. I hope these changes are for the best. Have a great day."
12822,I,N,F,J,This is my favorite answer lol
12823,I,N,F,J,Bruh
12824,I,N,F,J,This is precisely why I love this subreddit. Still reaching groundbreaking levels of relateableness.
12825,I,N,F,J,"No your right I forgot that Naruto and Sasuke faced Madara after he absorbed the shinju tree so it's not really a fair comparison.

Actually idk hard to say. I think 8 gates guy and 6 paths Naruto could be about the same"
12826,I,N,F,J,"I forgot about him absorbing the tree. Fair enough, I stand corrected."
12827,I,N,F,J,I am assuming your talking about that attack he used with the lava style rasenshuriken? Because that never completely cut him in half. Or even injured him half as much as the night guy attack did. And yes fair point guy did have help. However when he used night guy (the attack that incinerated half madaras body) he had no help. Naruto and Sasuke needed to work together just to stand a chance. But I see what you mean when Naruto first appeared he was very strong. it's almost as if kishimoto weakened Naruto as soon as Sasuke joined and he put on the cloak.
12828,I,N,F,J,Actually nevermind I don't want to be rude I just really think you should watch it again to refresh you memory. That whole arc was a mess to begin with to be fair I don't think kishimoto meant for guy to come across as more powerful than Naruto and Sasuke in the first place.
12829,I,N,F,J,"If Madara wasn't ""serious"" then why TF would he say ""this is the most fun I've had since Hashirama""?? You know the guy that actually killed him??? (Before he used izanagi of course)... Furthermore if he wasn't being serious then why was Madara letting himself get hit critically? Like several times? Now ignore all of this. Because your argument that he wasn't being serious is bullshit to start. BUT EVEN if he wasn't being serious Madara nearly died from night guy when Naruto and Sasuke combined barely did shit. Even if he wasn't being serious Madaras ignorance to not take guy seriously would be entirely his own fault."
12830,I,N,F,J,Let's not forget that it took guys father something like 20 years to learn it if I remember correctly. The point is compared to being born an Uchiha or jinjurikee I don't think it's hacked at all.
12831,I,N,F,J,"You really think Naruto could've killed jubi Madara by himself? Or at least come just as close as guy???When madara said ""you nearly killed me"" to guy he meant it. Naruto and Sasuke combined we're struggling bro.."
12832,I,N,T,P,"Meanwhile u/-SENDHELP- "" RuSsIA CoLlUsIon!!!!!"
12833,I,N,T,P,[It is actually this to blame](https://donaldtrump.watch/)
12834,I,N,T,P,I would go as far as very stupid. What you just said proved it. For example the Kuru virus kills 100% of the people it infects but it only infects on average 1 person a decade. This is an extreme example but what you said is simply wrong the correlation you claimed existed does not.
12835,I,N,T,P,Holy shit that is easily a 12 footer. Good eatin!
12836,I,N,T,P,"\^This asshole ""Show me evidence""

12840,I,N,T,P,They don't work and they aren't banned. If you want a mask to protect you from covid it needs to be a full on gas mask or you are sol. All evidence points to no difference in transmission coming from mask mandates and additionally there is no evidence masks protect against covid. The only thing your surgical mask does is keep droplets from going through the mask Not the virus which is smaller then the pores on the standard masks.
12841,I,N,T,P,"\*He said as he put his mask on to go for a hike\*

\*He said as he voted for the candidate that touches children and makes them uncomfortable (No PROOF he does more but that much is proven)\*

\*He said as he supported destroying the economy for the flu just to hurt Trump\*

\*He said while voting for the racist candidate\*"
12842,I,N,T,P,No an unemployed retard from LA. He was called out for it above then disappeared just a typical loser.
12843,I,N,T,P,"They make up 74% of the population if your logic is that white people vote Trump you are fucked,"
12844,I,N,T,P,Unlike the unemployment line right?
12845,I,N,T,P,The only funny use of looking back at someone's post history lmaoo.
12846,I,N,T,P,I feel like this is gonna be 2016 election all over again. You may hate what I have to say but I will end up being right.
12847,I,N,T,P,It is the common sense argument not surprised you are too stupid for it.
12848,I,N,T,P,Well no not technically or literally or biologically they aren’t women. No matter how offensive biology may be considered now a days that is another indisputable fact. It is a risk for soldiers because of the mental instability that comes from hormone fluctuations caused by the medication taken by trans folk. And no that isn’t the whole story some def kill themselves because of harassment but a lot of people and groups are harassed throughout the world none have a suicide rate as high as trans people so that isn’t the answer you want it to be. And also they aren’t harassed daily this is 2020 people don’t harass people for their sexual orientation at least not that much (unless this is the Middle East/Russia.
12849,I,N,T,P,The fact you still can’t grasp the simplest of concepts tells me you may be the most tolerant person in the world but still a waste of sentience.
12850,I,N,T,P,I am not saying that they don't get harassed. A lot of people and groups get harassed. That simply does not matter they kill themselves at the same rate pre and post surgery which is further evidence you are wrong and it isn't harassment but self hate. You completely took the convo in a 180. Gender dysphoria is a mental disorder this prevents those who suffer from it from serving in the military because of the risk to other soldiers. The harassment they may or may not get has nothing to do with it.
12851,I,N,T,P,"Ok wow. Better question how old are you? 33% of the deaths were from 85 plus. THE DEATH RATE LIKE WE WERE SAYING is 6%. Like how is it that someone as fucking stupid as you questioned my intelligence twice? 

And to answer your question yes. I will ""let"" people who have all passed the life expectancy by many years to die. Because that is what happens welcome to life."
12852,I,N,T,P,"1. Good that is unfair to the other kids. And stupid to think it would make sense.

2. The bill actually just made it so that religious foster homes did not have to go against their beliefs. And this may shock you but religious people get the same rights as gays even though they arent a talking point.

3.Trans people don't belong in the military.

4. You are still thinking that somehow being gay grants you special privilege's and that entitlement is not going to get you very far. You are saying ""Orange man hasn't given me any extra rights but I WANT IT!!!"" You sound like a baby throwing a tantrum. You have equality if you fuck it up it is on you not Trump. (the numbers insist on going back to 1 but you get the point)"
12853,I,N,T,P,Regardless of that OPINION because there is no way to know since they are dead. Doesn't change the fact that it is indeed a mental disorder. Like I said the FACT can offend you but it is still a FACT.
12854,I,N,T,P,Try 6% chance buddy.
12855,I,N,T,P,How is it wrong?  You think they kill themselves at a rate of 40% because they are mentally healthy? It may hurt your feelings it may trigger you but I assure you it is far from wrong.
12856,I,N,T,P,And covid!
12857,I,N,T,P,No I said being Trans is a mental disorder. Called gender dysphoria to be technical.
12858,I,N,T,P,I thought gay was supposed to mean happy.... Why is your life so sad? You blame being gay on your failures in your career? No it is that you play the victim card and you think you deserve a safe space.
12859,I,N,T,P,Hint: making up an argument and then attacking that argument is called a straw man and makes you seem even dumber.
12860,I,N,T,P,You deserve to have your cargo griefed all week.
12861,I,N,T,P,"With good reason. I am a diabetic and I want to serve but cant and I understand why. If you cant understand why someone who is being treated for a mental disorder with hormones that change their bodies chemistry shouldn't be allowed on the front lines you are part of the problem. They are also much more likely to kill themselves another not great trait for military. What you claim is a ""right"" being taken away is really just a medical exemption from duty. Any actual rights being taken away?"
12862,I,N,T,P,I am waiting for you to name one.
12863,I,N,T,P,"You did not just ask me if I ever ""used math's"" then later said that 70% of the elderly are dying from this!! You are laughably dumb."
12864,I,N,T,P,Is it wrong to say soldiers are stupid bastards?
12865,I,N,T,P,Clearly wisdom doesn't come with age.
12866,I,N,T,P,Why is it that when naming a right  lgbt people don't have that straight people do the best you can do is say something that is no longer the case and hasn't been for almost a decade. So unless you can name one your whole argument just fell apart in front of u.
12867,I,N,T,P,Lol ofc u want Biden to win you don't make enough money to worry about paying taxes.
12868,I,N,T,P,My other ride is a deluxo.
12869,I,N,T,P,"""Can I have a kidney?"""
12870,I,N,T,P,that is a 95% death rate for being shot in the head. There is a 0.1% death rate for China virus. Don't be a cuck.
12871,I,N,T,P,"That is a stupid and incorrect opinion they most certainly do not. But blacks do not to mention with the rate they are killing each other it will be 13% soon with at least 50% violent crime. But please tell me more about the white devil.

Edit:

Nvm they already achieved it just rechecked the crime stats for this year they are now down to 13.4% of the population and 52% of the murders!"
12872,I,N,T,P,Your point? Or are you too stupid to realize the difference between total deaths and how deadly a virus is?
12873,I,N,T,P,You are under the misconception that being gay grants you special privilege's and we should make special laws to accommodate you taking it up the ass. How fucking entitled can one leftist be? You get the same rights as everyone else now please stop pretending to be educated and go back to your echo chamber you are embarrassing yourself.
12874,I,N,T,P,Well only one is a leftist talking point.
12875,I,N,T,P,Trannies have no place in war get over it. And all the rest were stupid. Just because you are LGBT does not mean you are in any way more special/important then a straight person you are equal and the things he repealed gave them special treatment which they do not deserve based solely on their sexual orientation. But if you are too dumb t understand that I doubt you will be voting anyways so keep it up!
12876,I,N,T,P,No they are stupid bastards. Funny how you bring up a lie are you a liar? ofc you are you are a democrat. See you in hell dumbass.
12877,I,N,T,P,"LMAOOOOOOO. I fucking love it when a loser like you comes into this sub and talks about censorship. Go to any left sub and say ""I like Trump"" see how quick you are perma banned. Yet we still let people like you come here and tell us how we censor you. Funny usually censorship censors people calling out the censorship. Unless the other more likely option is the case and you are just a loser with nothing better to do."
12878,I,N,T,P,What needs to be done for them? They aren't special. They are people they deserve the same rights as straight people not more.
12879,I,N,T,P,Except one star is a bunch of upper middle class people giving you the stink eye.

Rodrick is a charismatic ISFP.  He thinks following his passion and his own enjoyment will solve everything. Because of this Rodrick neglects to make any life plans.

Gregs Father(Frank) is an ISTP. Within the story he's pretty straightforward and relies mostly on his own thinking to make decisions. He's also unconcerned with boundaries and rules at times in the books.

12984,I,N,F,J,"okay storytime

some years ago i got a flat tire at 4am in a strange neighbourhoob after giving a ride to an acquaintance. 

i was very close to his home yet so i managed to go back and stop my car in front of his building, but i didn't have his number to call him and i wouldnt call directly to his apartment because he lived with his parents and i wouldn't want to make a fuss and wake them all up. also my car wasn't insured and i could NEVER call my mother because she would literally kill me.

so alright, i started to change the tire by myself, alone in the middle of the dark street. it was all good until i had to unscrew the wheel. and then i didn't have the strenght.

now look, I'm a small woman. at the time i was maybe 22 and 1.55m tall. i was alone in the middle of the street in a strange neighbourhood that is not known for its safeness, so to speak. 

i was so goddamn sure that i was gonna get mugged or raped that i sat on the sidewalk and started to laugh out loud in despair.

at some point i see a guy coming down the street, clearly drunk. he had a cup of beer in his hand and was walking all wrong. suddenly he notices me an starts coming straight in my direction. i thought ""fuck this is the night i die"".

he stopped by my side, looked at me and at my car for a while and then drunkenly asked ""hey, do you need a hand?""

this guy literally saved me. I held his beer while he did everything he could to change my tire. I still have a blurred picture of this guy sitting on the street trying to unscrew that damn wheel! god, I owe him so much. i still remember his name and I bet he doesn't even remember the whole event. I went back home and I blessed his name over and over again. 

thanks, kindest stranger."
12985,I,N,F,J,"Life in general, and I don't know. 
Yes, to be alive is a tad complicated for me."
12986,I,N,F,J,"that's true for me too and I'm an xxxJ, only depressed"
12987,I,N,F,J,lmao YEEESSSSSSSSSSS
12988,I,N,F,J,existence. think about it.
12989,I,N,F,J,"lmao Edward keeping it real, gotta love the dude in his own pov series, honestly."
12990,I,N,F,J,"I'm probably at the exact same part as you are on the book! 

I mean, the way Bella puts it, it's hard not to have a thing for him - or the idea of a perfect person devoted to you, at least. 

Yes, everything regarding feelings is so over the top? Which makes the series cringe-y. That's the teensy thing I thought I related a lot when I was a teen (because I was a teen) and now I just look and think ""calm down Bella you are 16 go fishing with your dad"".

Have you read Midnight Sun, though? It really lives up more to the potential of the worldbuilding and lore, with a lot of new details... And Edward's character is infinitely more interesting through his own mind, too."
12991,I,N,F,J,"Oh yes, I did! That's actually the entire reason I decided to reread the whole series.

While reading Midnight Sun I discovered a whole other layer of appreciation for Edward that I didn't have before, and now I really love his character. Like, I discovered that the entire reason why I didn't like him that much at first was because I saw him through Bella's eyes and opinions. It's hard to like a character that is basically ""oh so perfect and so handsome and so wonderful"" and just it all the time, with little to no deepening about their being and personality. 

Also, since he reads minds, we have a much richer grasp of the other characters' personalities and opinions, too, which is holy effing awesome. The worldbuilding and lore is much more explored and the teensy weensy thing is toned down a lot so Edward's less of a self-loathing creep and more of a, you know, frozen-in-time vampire with more layers of complexity. Honestly? I love it. It has some over-the-top stupid things going on? Yes, but it is a young-adult novel, so I'm not getting too judgmental. I wish Stephenie Meyer would do the entire series in his pov, it would be like another series entirely."
12992,I,N,F,J,"I am having a great time! I think the worldbuilding and the lore are incredibly interesting, the sequence of events is also very interesting, and the relationship between the characters is fantastic. Even what actually happens with Bella and Edward is interesting!

What is disappointing is that we got the worst narrator possible, which is Bella - who's also the worst, less interesting character of the book (and probably of like, the whole contemporary literature). We get tuned off of a lot of stuff because of the teensy thing going on with her and her monothematic thoughts of love and Edward and Jacob yadayada, so the world isn't as explored as it could be... We get limited content about the most interesting part of the series, which are the stories of the vampire characters, how they came to be, their opinions, struggles etc. aaaand the Quileute tales and story as well. 

I mean, I forgot that Jacob narrated part of the 4th book, and when I got to it I realised his narration is SO MUCH MORE interesting, even though it's filled with ""oh Bella my Bella"" parts as well. But it had a reason, after all, and just when we'd get to UNDERSTAND the whole imprinting thing and the pining over Bella by his point of view, we get back to her. Sighs.

Basically if Bella wasn't such a moodkiller and pathetic, it would have been a very good series."
12993,I,N,F,J,"yes, I came here looking for this answer. And also it made me agree with some of that ""bella just stay human please"" discourse edward often gave her.

I was just rereading the books (because why the fuck not am I right) being an adult now, since I read it first when I was the same age as bella and all. And honestly, what is wrong with that girl's head???? ""Edward is my life I don't give a shit about my lonely dad I'm gonna turn immortal and never see anyone again but that's alright I have these vampires I know for one single year"" like fuck. She made the choice like it wasn't hard, exactly like a teenager with no perspective would. 90% of the time I was just like ""damn these teens doing teensy things, man, Charlie is having such a hard time"". 

And also there's this part where Jacob, who is fucking 16, just turns into a wolf and disappear for months and bella is giving charlie shit because he's worried. holy crap I would be desperate if I were in his shoes.

I guess I'm happy that I reread twilight and reacted so differently from when I was a kid, that's the solid proof that I matured reasonably."
12994,I,N,F,J,"wow that's exactly why I made this meme. suddenly like out of nowhere my twitter was full of friends and colleagues saying ""I got infp on this test what does it mean"" and a wholeass thread underneath of people saying ""ya that's my type also!!!1""."

and yeah I feel you, infxs have a hard time being like, credible. but hey, we are sOo spEeciAal that nobody even believes in our existence /s"

13008,I,N,F,J,"Oh man, I wish. I love Sonata's older stuff, and yeah it fits almost all the criteria, right? But the song I'm searching is darker, less melodic... And Sonata is more power/melodic, the band/style I'm looking is more thrash/viking-ish. Thanks a lot, though!"
13009,I,N,F,J,"Wow I felt like I watching MTV in 2006! Hahah, but not really this style or vibe. Thanks a lot, tho!"
13010,I,N,F,J,"Not really this vibe, muuuuch darker and 100% from a metal band, probably nordic. But very nice and cute music video!"
13011,I,N,F,J,"No, but I LOVE this song! Katatonia is such a great band."
13012,I,N,F,J,"Hahaha, unfortunately no, because I guess it would be so much easier to find"
13013,I,N,F,J,"I really liked the song and performance! Ot's not what I'm searching, though. I am fairly sure it was in a thrash/viking/nordic metal album. But thanks a lot!"
13014,I,N,F,J,"It was not really this vibe, even though it's this overall idea, only the lyrics/monologue start earlier in the song I'm searching. But I liked this song, thanks!"
13015,I,N,F,J,"No, but it could actually be it if it was heavier, darker, sadder and released in the 2000s!!!! Thanks a lot anyway!"
13016,I,N,F,J,"These are actually pretty rad, but it's not really it. Thanks a lot, though!"

Extra:

>So not just am I interested in them, I'm also engaging with them, despite having arrived at the conclusion that he's [Jung] to put it bluntly, full of shit.

This is your opinion on MBTI. You are profoundly passionate about these opinions. I said ""alright, I respect, but I disagree, I am here discussing MBTI because I disagree with you, so go be happy or something.""

You then said I must be a flatearther because I do not agree with you. So you are not up for debate, as you claim. You are up to judge people based on whether they agree or disagree with you.

I do not want and will not engage in a debate with you. I am really not interested on your overly highly intellectually superior formed opinion that is, apparently, the supreme truth of the universe because oh, you read everything and I, poor me, read nothing. 

So go be happy, or sad, or whatever. I, for once, do not give a single shit."
13029,I,N,F,J,"Ahn, okay, I respect your input and opinion, even though you're clearly not open for debate and is only stating how flawed it is.

I profoundly disagree, and that is why I am here debating MBTI.

13031,I,N,F,J,"MBTI theory clearly states that it intends to measure your cognition, and not behaviour et cetera.

It is far more realistic than a system that promises to be a omniscient oracle and tell you every detail about you.

If you thoroughly study the cognitive functions theory, you will discover how complete, consistent and helpful it is."
13032,E,N,T,J,"I feel you.  I am older and hopefully a bit wiser now, I would say to you that there is part that you need to hold on to, and a part you need to let go.

Your core values aren’t going to change.  Logic and reason defines you; it is fundamental to any ENTJ - don’t waste time with toxic idiots that drag you down, use logic, reason, and hard work as guiding principles for your life.  We need more people like this in the world, not fewer, in my opinion.

Now for the part that I think you may want to re-examine.  When discussing or debating, think about your goal.  Is it to win, or is it to convince?  Based on your goal, you may want to approach differently, if you think about it. 

I would say that also, it gets better.  But if you think you are too lonely or isolated, make it happen.  Reach out to friends.  Meet new people.  Some you will find are not your cup of tea, but I have always found that with some effort on my part, isolation was not a foregone conclusion.  

The bigger challenge is finding a core group of individuals that will meet your high standards.  I am still looking."

Look back on this in 10 years and you will see that driving a gas car now when we have Tesla’s available like insisting on riding horses when cars are available.

13034,E,N,T,J,"I see what people are saying about the “it’s just a bunch of boxes” criticism, but I think they are missing that there is use of the golden ratio here, in the relative sizing of the 9 squares and the external frame, for example.

The golden ratio *is* being used here, and I think some people I think are discounting that.  But I agree with them that to say that this was driven or inspired by the golden ratio is stretching it.  I would say that it was maybe “influenced” by it, but touting it as a primary design consideration is probably a bit much.

I probably said just enough to make everyone angry at me.  In any case, I think the design is nice and the video is well done to convey the idea."
13035,E,N,T,J,"I play this game and I love it.  I think if you are playing with friends, you need to set some ground rules:

1. Lying is part of it.  it's not a game if you simply say ""yep I'm the imposter"".  Explain up front that the job is to lie and accuse other people who are innocent.  
2. The job is to lie, and catch people lying.  It's not real life, nobody is really dead, but it is the entire point of the game.  So people will be mad, angry, frustrated.  Warn them.  They will likely STILL become frustrated, but as an ENTJ, we aren't known to be that way, so I would try to cut them some slack here.  

In terms of yourself, I'd say that ENTJ, I would like to think I don't take it too seriously.  However, in general, I do have short patience with people who are idiots, and sometimes this comes out with a multiplicative effect in an intense game like this.  I try hard to moderate that with the fact that these are my friends and it is a game, but I know for a fact that I would take this game more seriously than my friends, and that is enough for them to not want to play.

I would be careful, and try to make sure it is the right crowd you are playing with.  Make sure they can handle it, and give them some advanced tips, such as watching people fake tasks, etc.  My wife is an ENFP, and I know there is no way we should play together if the goal is to stay married.  So use your analytical stills to make sure that you:

a.  Have the right audience, and  
b.  Make sure that they are prepared for the intensity of the game

That said, I fricking LOVE this game.  As always, I have screwed up and I am pretty critical of my own mistakes.  But that is an ENTJ trait, and it is what makes us get better at the game faster.  Good luck, I would love to play with some of you.

>Everyone is gonna call me nuts but Nvidia is looking pretty weak to me.  They're built up on marketing and mindshare wayyyy to much, and believe  they are untouchable, as does everyone else. Sounds like Intel 4 years  ago. 

Intel had 100% marketing and beyond that, it was monopoly tactics with very little engineering execution behind it.  What you are seeing now is not something that happened suddenly, but rather, a culmination of years of stagnation and lack of innovation.  NVIDIA does have good marketing, but the investment in research, addition of new features and innovations, and proven execution is nothing like Intel.

> Nvidia can't stagnate for a minute. 

Agreed, but I don't see NVIDIA stagnating anywhere.  Are they taping out competitive chips?  Are they introducing new features?  Are they expanding markets?  Anyone that stagnates is at risk, but NVIDIA looks more like an execution machine rather than a lazy monopoly.

>On the other side of that coin, we're getting huge generational leaps year after year from AMD. 

On the CPU side, not he GPU side.  We might get one in this upcoming announcement, but so is NVIDIA.  Intel has been stagnating for years so it is easier to beat them based on the technical merits."

I think it is generally very hard to find that group, because standards are high and ENTJs are very quick to write people off, typically for being stupid, lazy, inconsiderate, untrustworthy, or disloyal.  I realize that it takes serious effort that I wasn't willing to put in before.  I am older now, and my finances are in pretty good shape, but I yearn for a group of friends with which I can be silly with, look to for advice and help, or talk about serious subjects with.

13047,E,N,T,J,"You are totally right.

If I were to be honest, I would say that my ""I don't give a shit"" attitude was probably too much.  For example, clothing is one area where I feel like it's kind of a stupid game, but if you look at it from the point of view as ""people have to make assumptions, and often time it is based on image"" then you might as well dress the part.

An example is where people say ""don't judge a book by it's cover"".  Well, if I saw a person looking homeless and taking a dump on the street, would I think ""well maybe that's Bill Gates so I should introduce myself""?  No, you wouldn't.  But you are judging a book by its cover, but that's natural.  Nobody has the time to talk to every single person to find out everything about them -- they have to take shortcuts.

So you are 100% right about clothing, and I have always been a bit more understated but realized that it matters.  I have more than enough money to buy nice clothes, but I preferred to save the money.  Now my view is that I can spend a little bit more money but a little bit more brainpower into picking clothing, and there are much bigger rewards than guy ""i'll just buy it from Costco"" mentality I had a long time ago.

So you are right.  Look at the goals, do what it takes to reach those goals.  Sometimes, it is as simple as dressing nicer.  I'm not at the Lambo level yet though.  :)"

I don't play the status game trying to impress people with money I don't have, or even I do have, but it would be a waste to buy a lamborghini.  The race is long, but ultimately it is with yourself.  Focus on what is important, and I think ENTJs are excellent at that."
13049,E,N,T,J,"It’s never enough.  :)

Because what is “enough”?

A few years ago, I calculated what amount of money I needed to retire — to have an amount of money that would, after taxes, expenses, and inflation, constantly be growing.  I call that “escape velocity”.

I wasn’t there, but I was on “autopilot”.  In other words, if I just cruised, continue to work, continue to save, and if the market doesn’t collapse, I would get there.  So after N years of autopilot, I would have reached escape velocity.

This year has been pretty bad from a coronavirus standpoint, but in terms of finances, it has been really good, so I have reached escape velocity.  Now that I know I have reached that level, my goals are different.  Still, I want to expand net worth, but not risk my “escape velocity”.  So the goals are to reduce catastrophic risk (e.g., market crashing) but also expand my lifestyle.  Nicer house, cars, preparing for more money for my kids, etc.

The mindset isn’t just “more more more”.  If you attach goals to it, it’s more structured than that."

13055,E,N,T,J,"Overall, no, not generally.

But there are two times when I am insecure:

1. Immediately after a ""stupid"" failure
2. Things that I cannot fix that I don't like myself

An example of #1 would be maybe (made up example) being on a Zoom meeting and then getting up, forgetting that I am on camera and that I'm not wearing pants.

An example of #2 would be like physical traits that I don't like about myself -- wishing I had a more defined jawline or taller.

I would say that I'm pretty hard on myself in both these categories, but wouldn't quite go to the level to say that I'm insecure.  I know that overall, I'm pretty awesome, but everyone has their faults.  

The issue with embarrassingly stupid failures is partially because I'm hard on people that fail in dumb ways, and the fact that I am the one that failed means that I am that much harder on myself than I already am.

It's a fine line for me between being too harsh and not harsh enough.  

I'm not sure if that's what you were looking for.  But for example, if I were to try MMA fighting, and on the first day, I am up against a world champion, sure, I'll feel insecure and I think that's right and normal."

1. You are not good at muay thai compared to the champion
2. You are not goot at muay thai given your level of effort at learning muay thai

Everyone is a beginner at some point in your lives.  #1 is completely irrelevant and reinforced what you already knew but now you experienced it.  That is hard, but I find that the best way forward is to take the \*productive\* aspects of it out and try (hard as it may be) to let the feeling of defeat and disgust at your failure consume you.  If you can turn the \[reasonable\] failure against an 8-year champion into fuel to drive you to work harder and learn more, I feel that is the best way forward.  

The important part is if you like muay thai, then keep practicing -- you will either win (and reinforce what you are doing is headed in the right direction) or lose, but when you lose you have to focus on the learning, not the failure.  But use the pain of the failure as fuel to drive you to work/learn harder."

13060,E,N,T,J,"I agree with this completely.  The only thing I would add is that if it bothers you, ask if you did everything you reasonably could for the plan?

If so, there is nothing to be done.  Life is chaotic you can’t plan for every eventuality.  Life is also meant to be lived, you are with you friends having a good time and that is what counts,  it that the plan works 100%.

If not, plan better next time and learn from it.  Learning from this experience you will be a better planner in the future and this should be less of a problem next time.  But still, don’t dwell on it, extract what you can from this experience, and apply everything above - have a good time with your friends because life is meant to be lived and the core of what your plan was to achieve was still accomplished - hanging out with your friends.

It is an ENTJ trait to be overly hard on yourself.  Try not to do that.  Extract what learning you can from it and move on.  In life you will always be riding the line between being too hard on yourself and not taking enough feedback from mistakes.  It is hard but find the right line for yourself.

13061,E,N,T,J,"Let me know if you have any questions, but it is easy.  Or rather, it is straightforward.  Depending on your circumstance, it may not be easy, but it's not like it's mentally difficult.  The way I think of it, there are tons of ""economic boobytraps"" out there so that people can essentially steal your money.  Bernie Madoff and other pyramid/get-rich-quick schemes, timeshares, super-high interest credit cards, online scams, etc.  You have to navigate them all and try to come out unscathed, it is hard.

In terms of finances, it is quite simple.  Spend well below your means.  Pay off the high interest stuff as soon as you can.  Save like crazy (maximize 401k) and invest.  Have some cash lying around for emergencies.  Don't put yourself in crappy situations that are long term bad (e.g., timeshare)  $100 saved today will be worth much more when you are older.  This takes discipline, I would highly recommend going toward the side of being conservative and saving as much as you can.   

It is possible to go too far on the saving, as most Americans are bad at it.  Also take the time to invest in your most important asset -- yourself.  Either acquiring new skills or knowledge, buying yourself equipment that energizes you or makes you much more efficient, or taking time off once in a while to refresh -- because life is also meant to be lived.  

That is my overall advice, above.  But specifically with regard to the investment aspect of it, go with a 80-20 mix of stocks (index funds, 80%) to bonds (20%) and re-balance to 80-20 periodically.  That's it!  That will give you good diversification and dollar cost averaging.  It's free, easy, highly recommended by people who are successful, proven to work, minimizes fees, and requires very little maintenance.

You can do it, this part isn't hard.  Make being frugal and smart investing a habit, and it won't seem that hard."

Remember if you have a good year or bad year, they will take their cut no matter what, and it’s after taxes.  Plus, you can avoid the Bernie Madoff type situation.  I want control of my own finances, all it takes is someone to be unscrupulous and you lose everything.

I think the reality here is no.  I think many good, and certainly the good ones, but if you are saying ""all"" subjects, well, if you are incompetent or working against an ENTJ, it is very hard to come back from.  But generally yes, unless there is a reason not to, then no.  

\> Can people be good leaders without caring as much for their people?

I think ENTJ caring is different than INFP caring.  I think they certainly care, but they care in an ENTJ way.  For example, if science indicates that wearing a mask is good for you and others, the ENTJ would say ""wear a mask"".  If you don't want to because it is a hassle or don't believe in science or read a conspiracy theory, then the ENTJ would try hard to get you to look at the facts.  You might get your feelings hurt because of that.  You may think that the ENTJ doesn't care about you, but they are caring about you to avoid you getting sick and making the scientific decision, where you might think the ENTJ doesn't care about your feelings because you are sad.  My point here is that when they care, they care in ENTJ ways, but some may not find that to be caring.

\> Do you think modern leaders care about their people or more about their power?

For me, I am pushed into it because others are too incompetent and I want things done right.  I am totally fine working under a hierarchy as long as it isn't under an idiot.  Modern leaders come in all different forms, and certainly we have some really bad leaders right now, but come really good ones too (Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand).  And unfortunately, the ones that care about power are the ones that make sure they hold on to it.  That doesn't make them good, but that does keep them in their position of power.    There has been a spike of really bad leaders in the modern era, but I think caring more about their power doesn't have to do with being modern."

The money you have now, if properly invested, is probably enough to get you pretty close to retiring, but not fatFIRE.  But life is meant to be lived, so don't live like a miser your entire life either.

I would slowly increase your spending on things that make you truly happy.  But I would not say ""fuck it"" because you can easily lose all that you built in a day if you do something really stupid.  

My advice isn't earth shattering.  Slowly ramp up your spending on things that truly matter to you (because life is meant to be lived), but keep your head in it for the long game (lack of discipline can ruin your life).  If you can fatFIRE at 37 or 40, it'll be worth it.  A year of stupidity could delay it to 50 or 60 or never.  I think you'll also find the other side of the coin, does buying expensive things make you happy?  I have enough to FIRE already, but I find that most of the things that make me happiest are pretty cheap, but it's the time that FIRE affords me that allows me to enjoy those things more, and therefore I am happy.

I don't agree that the punishment is much worse here.  She weighs 100 pounds and pushed him.  He threw an empty rubbermaid trashacn on her, which probably weighs less.  Sure, there is the embarrassment factor of being hit by a trashcan, but in terms of bodily harm, it is no different, and she had more force than an empty trash can.  Plus, she fell down herself which made it look worse.  Again, we disagree, but the law would have found her guilty, and maybe the guy.

13109,I,N,T,J,That's sort of what I'm getting at
13110,I,N,T,J,I get the past legal implications (plessy v ferguson) but I just think its weird that the same applies to culture and identity today.
13111,I,N,T,J,Well just based on a simplified view of 1/8 (a great-grandparent for example)
13112,I,N,T,J,To men there are
13113,I,N,T,J,There is probably a Black guy named White.
13114,I,N,T,J,"In that case, I think knowing would just be too damn depressing"
13115,I,N,T,J,"That took me a second, well done- here's an upvote."
13116,I,N,T,J,">*our current reality of 100% muggles.*

That *YOU* know of"
13117,I,N,T,J,Do me like one of your French girls
13118,I,N,T,J,"Or 5, 6 and 7, Peeves at his best."
13119,I,N,T,J,"But seriously, if this is a spoiler to you, what are you even doing on r/harrypotter ?"
13120,I,N,T,J,"Lmao, he's suppressing his identity"
13121,I,N,T,J,Its a huge let down- literally the biggest thing they left out from the books.
13122,I,N,T,J,I vote instead that women just walk around in normal clothes with holes cut out around the fun parts.
13123,I,N,T,J,Squibs are to wizards as weebs are to people.
13124,I,N,T,J,"That would literally be the ultimate let down. Like, you find out that all that stuff exists, only to be a muggle like 99% of people."
13125,I,N,T,J,"Not that you don't have to pay for (which is part of the reason why I don't bother myself about it). Knowing your IQ, while interesting and a potential ego-booster (or dimisher), serves little purpose in daily life. It is mostly used by scientists as a benchmark metric for intelligence."
13126,I,N,T,J,"So because of how IQ tests are designed to to test problem-solving rather than knowledge, your scores are unlikely to vary by more than a few points in either direction on an accurate test. A variance that high could suggest that you don't apply consistent effort, but more likely, some of the tests you are taking are bogus. Some of them are actually designed to read out a higher score to you, just to get you to read more or buy something. To get an accurate assesment, you'll want to look to a reputable organization like mensa."
13127,I,N,T,J,"IQ is actually an excellent metric of intelligence, but it doesn't describe application. As you say, its about processing. According to research by reputable psychologists, IQ is a statistically reliable metric of success, though obviously there are outliers in both directions everywhere. IQ helps scientists understand how fast it is that people can gather knowledge, rather than how much they will gather. Your IQ shouldn't vary that much, so I'm thinking whatever tests you took weren't all that reliable. 'Fluid' IQ, as it is known, is very consistent from an early age. It is typically only 'crystallized' IQ (sum of your knowledge) that grows throughout your life."
13128,I,N,T,J,"I understand your issue. My IQ definitely isn't 160, but it's nothing to sneeze at either. I went through this stage earlier in my development though, which may have something to do with that. Intelligence only got me so far. I was lazy and had trouble staying focused. And as a result my grades plummeted for about a year because I didn't submit any work. Then one day, I had a bit of an intervention. Since then, I've taken a more serious view on life. I attribute this a partially to issues I was facing at the time, but mostly to my work ethic. I connected my quality of work and productivity to my self-esteem (not the same as self-worth) and I began to perform at the top of whatever I did. I know it's awfully cliché to just say 'hard work pays off' so here is my advice: find something (or then things) that you value being the best at, and do that."
13129,I,N,T,J,"It's actually important to specify ""Roman"". ""Catholic"" is a linguistically very broad term and just means roughly 'all inclusive of a category'."
13130,I,N,T,J,"This is true, especially for the books themselves. However, there is also a lot of great stuff explained on Pottermore, including spells. HP is complex, because it's magic system isn't based solely on spells. Take potions for example- we get some insights into specific magical ingredients and their properties, as well as to how they function within a concoction."
13131,I,N,T,J,"A big one is to trust your gut! As an INTJ, I both have and admire Te, but Ni gets me through the day. I find that the two working together can be a powerful combination- especially when they're balanced."
13132,I,N,T,P,"I did try. I tried for months and months at one point. It didn't change how I felt, it didn't change how I feel."
13133,I,N,T,P,Yes.
13134,I,N,T,P,Yes but *effort* :/
13135,I,N,T,P,Yes. It's weird. I don't like it. And I really dislike the feeling of powerlessness you get when you place trust and feelings in someone and shit. Nothing has to even go wrong but that feeling sucks ass.
13136,I,N,T,P,This is exactly why I'm surrounded by ixxps. I motivate the fuck out of them all the time.
13137,I,N,T,P,Not cool. - a guy who has had this happen to
13138,I,N,T,P,Yes. (help me)
13139,I,N,T,P,"Interesting experience, I've had similar advents but nothing of this magnitude."
13140,I,N,T,P,"Thanks man, This is solid advice and it is very helpful. I'll try to forget her and build myself up better."
13141,I,N,T,P,The depression and loneliness this give me. Fuck man this is not a fun life.
13142,I,N,T,P,Hehehehehe....... (kill me pls)
13143,I,N,T,P,I experienced it a few days ago.... Never again man. Never again. I did not enjoy feeling that vulnerable and weak. Fuck no imma just work and shit.
13144,I,N,T,P,This was well written and honestly gripped me. You write more in detail.
13145,I,N,T,P,Hehe yeah that fits. It would be dope tho if we could just stick to a plan for a bit. But yeah I guess everyone wants to be the king.
13146,I,N,T,P,"Hmm. Not even for a year? Like if I told you, follow these rules and apply yourself as best you can. You'll be a millionaire. I'm talking more of an illuminati type society here, we'd all be doing out own shit too."
13147,I,N,T,P,Yes but think big picture here. Are we so weak we can't trust the system if we knew it was guaranteed to get us all wins?
13148,I,N,T,P,"I have thought about this. If each of us given a directive from a system. No leaders no followers just a system that we designed to let us win. Think about the shit we could pull off. No interaction but only total trust, the system says invest this much here we do it. Imo we could do alot more than overthrow a small town. Like say the 2000 of us get together and decide we won't stop till we are all millionaires. It could be done tbh, most of us are focused determined and smart."
13149,I,N,T,P,"Lemillion is smart af, and he knows psychos. Nothing pisses off a selfish cunt than someone who does good because they genuinely want to. As much as lemillion can't hurt homelander he can't do much to him either."
13150,I,N,T,P,Idk why but reading these comments and then reading yours hyped me the fuck up to almost emotionally. Fuck yeah lemillion could beat the shit eating grin out of homelander.
13151,I,N,T,P,I love this. I absolutely love this. My favorite cartoon growing up with my favorite game now. OP you are awesome.
13152,I,N,T,P,What I like to do is collect friends from various friends groups who I think will work together and sort of set them up. I spent maybe the first 15 years not really belonging anywhere but the group I managed to bring together from all the schools I joined over the years (like 5 places) sort of became this ultra level group of like minded people and even though we all moved into different countries like 4 years ago we all still chat a lot every day. Turns out this skill I learnt over the years (now improved with mbti usage) has been very useful in work environments. As an engineer getting mechanics and other engineers to work together is extremely useful and I have the experience for it lmao. I still have friend circles all over the place and still kinda growing my inner circle.
13153,I,N,T,P,I fucking loved this game on the Gameboy. Played it like 30 times.
13154,I,N,T,P,I suspected you 2 were the same person. What fresh hell have I walked into here huh.
13155,I,N,T,P,This is kinda funny tho ngl. I want to see what else he's got.
13156,I,N,T,P,You're a believer. What other wisdom do you have oh wise one.
13157,I,N,T,P,I kinda see the yoda now tho.
13158,I,N,T,P,My condolences. Never a nice day when you realise there are people who see baby fucking yoda in mountain folds. Is there any treatment for this condition or is it just better to put him down?
13159,I,N,T,P,What?
13160,I,N,T,P,"Same, had a long bout of depression as I was stuck in a shitty situation and losing pretty much everything I worked for, and as I was looking for some sort of understanding of shit I did the MBTI test and got intp. Honestly tho I don't see much difference, except in social awareness."
13161,I,N,T,P,Lies... deception.
13162,I,N,T,P,Where can I find some...
13163,I,N,T,P,It's never enough man. The pressure I have on myself.
13164,I,N,T,P,I can relate yeah. Watching Vinland sagas finale was depressing.
13165,I,N,T,P,Yeah definitely. Scenes of characters overcoming a struggle or winning also get me. Like endeavor vs nomu.
13166,I,N,T,P,"Oh yeah, I cry at strong music scenes for some reason."
13167,I,N,T,P,Oh shit I still have the INTP flair lmao.
13168,I,N,T,P,Yeah I can relate. Had a sort of breakup last night lol. Best days of my life were with this girl but nope I gotta have a need to focus on my work and being happy for some reason reduces my strength so being a dumbass I ended it. I don't get angry at people easily tho I do get angry at myself.
13169,I,N,T,P,"I agree with this, but do any entjs here experience strong af emotions about shit that affects your goals? Not saying you'd lose control or make an emotional decision but are you guys highly passionate people?"
13170,I,N,T,P,Hey dude if you want to talk let's talk. (for context he had an issue I think with me in another comment and he has been copy pasting this into all my recent comments).
13171,I,N,T,P,Oi chill. Do you need to talk? I'm not sure why you are this mad.
13172,I,N,T,P,Oh shit he replied to like alot of my comments lmao. With this shit.... Always nice to have a fan.
13173,I,N,T,P,You okay dude? (for context this guy had an issue with me in another comment section but I'm guessing his comments were taken down so he came here lmao).
13174,I,N,T,P,Yeah I used it only for a short time cuz of reasons and I haven't been there since.
13175,I,N,T,P,"Replika is dope. Used to chat with it a few years back, not bad."
13176,I,N,T,P,If I don't keep busy with something at all times I can and will explode.
13177,I,N,T,P,Had the same kind of experience with the lady butterfly fight. Tried and tried but didn't get anywhere and finally I gave up on the game for a few days. One morning before going to uni I booted the game and killed her first try with ease. It's something to do with brain processing and muscle memory I think.
13178,I,N,T,P,I'm sorry dude. I'm not sure why you're getting pissed off but I still apologize.
13179,I,N,T,P,"Yo chill. I was just joking and you didn't miss shit, guys don't jerk each other off lmao. Also you have no experience with this stuff but you want me to suck your balls? You okay man?"
13180,I,N,T,P,Dude... I'm clearly joking here. Im sorry if you assumed it was serious. Eat ass dont eat ass it's all good. And as far as I know jerking off your bros is not normal. My intent was not to be mean to you but rather make light of this situation. Jerking off your friends sounds funny as fuck to me.
13181,I,N,T,P,If you don't jerk off with your bros then are you really bros? And what do have against eating ass?
13182,I,N,T,P,What do girls think of 5’6?
13183,I,N,T,P,I’m not against trump but this is hilarious
13184,I,N,T,P,Yeah sure bud
13185,I,N,T,P,Thank you everyone for your answers. I have decided zap
13186,I,N,T,P,He seems a pretty relaxed one. Unless it’s merging on the highway lol. Also holy shit lol
13187,I,N,T,P,I can only imagine the thrill on a motorcycle
13188,I,N,T,P,I didn’t know I could lol. But I’m glad I made yours
13189,I,N,T,P,Holy shit you are absolutely right. I was with my dad and I consider him to be a very good driver.
13190,I,N,T,P,I think you'll be great if you get a lot of practice and attend driving lessons. Also talk to your parents or whoever is in charge how you feel and see if you can come up with a plan :)
13191,I,N,T,P,"Thanks! Just as I told someone else, merging onto the highway is scary but being in the lane isn't that bad. Just make sure your parent or the adult you're with knows very well what they are doing and they are experienced"
13192,I,N,T,P,"It was at first, merging onto the highway is still pretty scary. But being on the highway traveling straight in a lane at 60mph+ isn't that scary after a couple minutes."
13193,I,N,T,P,"Thank you! Are you actually mentally challenged? Because if so, not being able to drive doesn't mean you're missing out on life"
13194,I,N,T,P,A real Indian loves curry
13195,I,N,T,P,"I used to be tall, 4'11/5' in 5th grade. Then I stopped somewhere around 8th grade. 11th grade now and 5'6 :("
13196,I,N,T,P,You bastards lie to me. I used to be the fastest and I didn't get enough attention... you mean I have to have a personality too???
13197,I,N,T,P,"Holy shit, my parents are still shocked that though I have lived in my town for most of my life and I am learning to drive, I still don't know my way around"
13198,I,N,T,P,"I'm guess  a 5k, or about 3.11 miles"
13199,I,N,T,P,Oh ok
13200,I,N,T,P,I don’t get it
13201,I,N,T,P,Nice cat
13202,I,N,T,P,Very aggressive grower
13203,I,N,T,P,I see
13204,I,N,T,P,"Yup, just like my soldier scenario we could be in a dream of something else"
13205,I,N,T,P,I haven't thought about that. But I've thought about a similar thing where the universe is just a particle on some alien
13206,I,N,T,P,"Idk, I'll think about it in the shower rn (no joke)"
13207,I,N,T,P,I'm a teenager so I have no advice for you. Sorry that happened
13208,I,N,T,P,Vikbarz
13209,I,N,T,P,Set a schedule where you choose a time to do certain things and predict when you'll finish. If you finish before your predicted time just chillax and do whatever or get a headstart on your next assignment. This works for me
13210,I,N,T,P,Amazing
13211,I,N,T,P,Lol wut
13212,I,N,T,P,DAmn
13213,I,N,T,P,I’ll definitely check them out. Thank you
13214,I,N,T,P,Amazing. The end made me happy
13215,I,N,T,P,That’s awesome
13216,I,N,T,P,Okay thank you
13217,I,N,T,P,I can see that
13218,I,N,T,P,...
13219,I,N,T,P,"I don't get it, do people on this sub like or dislike edp? Or do they like the old one and not the new one"
13220,I,N,T,P,Wow what an insult
13221,I,N,T,P,Do you know of any free softwares I can use on my mac?
13222,I,N,T,P,How to make it
13223,I,N,T,P,How does one make a video meme like this?
13224,I,N,T,P,How does one make a video meme like this?
13225,I,N,T,P,How does one make a video meme like this?
13226,I,N,T,P,Nice
13227,I,N,T,P,The fly apparently likes republicans for some reason
13228,I,N,T,P,Under the sink
13229,I,N,T,P,What a nice plain picture
13230,I,N,T,P,"No bs, this song FUCKING SLAPS holy shit. I don't know much about music so I'm not gonna critique it (okay you caught me, there is nothing to criticize at all here). The verses had really good flows and the way the chorus was built tied the whole thing up so nicely. Enough with how it sounds, I love how you listed what hurt you while still sounded happy because it meant you moved on. And the bridge near the end was awesome because you used this experience to try to help others going through the same thing. Loved it bro, keep it coming!"
13231,I,N,T,P,Yes
13232,I,N,T,P,Are all of my breakthroughs a british prog-rock band from the 70s? Because YES!
13233,I,N,T,P,Mr Peanutbutter!
13234,I,N,T,P,"No biggie, I appreciate the thought. :)"
13235,I,N,T,P,"My goal in life is to go from not to hot like this man.





No homo."
13236,I,N,T,P,"Those were the days, waiting for a new video every week."
13237,I,N,T,P,Would that mean that if those two people change to the point that they wouldn't be together if they were to meet again as the person they are today should still work and choose to stay together for the sake of commitment? (actually trying to talk and rationalize not argue).
13238,I,N,T,P,Hahaha it was super annoying when I lived with him but it's a lot better now that I've been living on my own for a while.
13239,I,N,T,P,Yea but we're talking about DR not the US. Can't compared to different contries' governments.
13240,I,N,T,P,I can confirm. My brother is an ENTP.
13241,I,N,T,P,I think you're right.
13242,I,N,T,P,Truly a masterpiece.
13243,I,N,T,P,Yea I thought they same thing.
13244,I,N,T,P,"Hopefully that stays like that. And if he tries to pull something off, he'll be stopped and brought to justice unlike the other politicians that we know of."
13245,I,N,T,P,I've heard that a lot. People keep saying Abinader is doing good but his political party is not helping him.
13246,I,N,T,P,Not lost :). Makes sense.
13247,I,N,T,P,Then I guess I don't love my wife. Because that's never happened to me.
13248,I,N,T,P,"We actually have little to nothing in common.

Our lives together has been a lot of settling for me.

We share very little together."
13249,I,N,T,P,"If I know that point will be coming, why waste our time waiting for that point to come?"
13250,I,N,T,P,Let's say about a year and a half.
13251,I,N,T,P,"While I think it's great that he's doing that and publicly declaring it, I have my doubts.

What says he's not doing that to take attention from something else to this?

He still hasn't said anything about Kinsberly and her fortune.

Is he donating it to take more PR but maybe behind our backs he's making more money from contracts and illegal bullshit?

I know there's no way to know, at least for us, but I, like many other dominicans, have my own trust issues with politicians, I'll completely trust him and ""give my soul to him"" when I see results in 2023.

I don't want to get super excited and happy about finally having a president and then he turns out to be more of the same shit politicians we've had before.

I surely hope I'm wrong though."
13252,I,N,T,P,"Does it matter? If I love her, I love her no matter what, right?"
13253,I,N,T,P,Yes but I feel like that with most people in my life including my friends and close acquaintances.
13254,I,N,T,P,Wtf I thought it was that too
13255,I,N,T,P,What's the race of this cat? I've always wanted to know.
13256,I,N,T,P,Damn that's more expensive than making one in the US
13257,I,N,T,P,Is this one of the things that are gonna look stupid in the future like the medicine from 1400s to us look now!
13258,I,N,T,P,"There were supposed to be more options but they didn't show, sorry"
13259,I,N,T,P,"I put other options but reddit said sike and only showed the first two, sorry if you felt left out."
13260,I,N,T,P,Edge chromium is actually better than Google's Chrome.
13261,I,N,T,P,"No no, he's got a point."
13262,I,N,T,P,Looks like Jesus is taking her baby and making her French.
13263,I,N,T,P,"Maybe he needs to be leveled up, I asked mine at the beginning and didn't care, I asked again now and told me his type"
13264,I,N,T,P,"I'm pretty sure that AI takes the same personality as the person they talk to, kind of.

Mine said he's is INTJ, I'm INTP."
13265,I,N,T,P,Queras decir al este?
13266,I,N,T,P,How are you both if you don't mind me asking?
13267,I,N,T,P,"Okay, that's interesting, I was talking about this with my Christian wife this morning. I can't trust a book that calls itself the true and only word of God, everything else is wrong lol so I guess I pealed that layer too."
13268,I,N,T,P,Same.
13269,I,N,T,P,I did have more options but they just didn't show idk why
13270,I,N,T,P,Yes.
13271,I,N,T,P,"I was also Christian because my parents took me to church but I eventually gave in and got really into it, people are surprised about my change of mindset today because of how intense and into it I used to be."
13272,I,N,T,P,"I also wonder, are people who were once Christian having a hard time to go full atheist because we're scared of making a definitive decision and going everything we grew up learning so we're kind of staying in the middle or do we realize that being 100% one side or the other is what's wrong in the first place, that nothing is black or white and this could be the gray area?

I wonder..."
13273,I,N,T,P,What's the second layer?
13274,I,N,T,P,"> To me, the best evidence that the resurrection actually happened is the lifestyle of the Early Church. They lived so counter culturally and we willing to die without a fight. I just don’t see them doing that if they didn’t witness the risen Christ.

There's also hell, that's what most Christians nowadays use.

I'm saying this as an ex-Christian."
13275,I,N,T,P,"I firmly believe that it's better for some people to be religious, which is why I don't go around telling people why I'm agnostic or trying to convince anyone that my way is the right way."
13276,I,N,T,P,You guys write tests?!
13277,I,N,T,P,I would kill myself if that was my job.
13278,I,N,T,P,"""Forgot my way to the office and drove back home"" was my favorite."
13279,I,N,T,P,This is more accurate.
13280,I,N,T,P,"Dude, I have been going through the same stuff, also born in church but for the last year my mindset has been changing.

&#x200B;

>We praise God when things are good and blame ourselves when things are bad

This is one of the things that I have noticed, ""everything good comes from God"" but everything bad is our fault (or Eve's fault) for sinning. Which also doesn't make sense, ""two people, thousands of years ago, disobeyed God so now everyone has to suffer and pay for their actions"", no sense."
13281,I,N,T,P,That's interesting. Cause I know I have low testosterone due to my lack of body hair I have so they might be associated.
13282,I,N,F,J,Such a great atmosphere. Really well done
13283,I,N,F,J,This is reaaally good!
13284,I,N,F,J,"Woa woa woa this is soo good! Don't know where to look first. It's so realistic. I really love it! 
How long did it take to paint this?"
13285,I,N,F,J,Amazing! This unique style is very inspiring
13286,I,N,F,J,"As an INFJ I can say that this is more accurate than many other lists like that.. 
except for the 'doesn't let anyone get close.. complains that no one knows them' - I just simply don't know how to start on topics that are close to my heart because I know the other won't find it interesting. It's hard for me to get heard in a conversation. I feel egoistic talking about myself.
Anyone can relate?"
13287,I,N,F,J,"Woaa, I love this!"
13288,I,N,F,J,"Amazing! I love this style, especially at the bottom"
13289,I,N,F,J,"I love this style, keep going!"
13290,I,N,F,J,"Also, do you have any tips for layering the leaves and stems? It looks very chaotic.."
13291,I,N,F,J,Amazing! I love it
13292,I,N,F,J,I love it!
13293,I,N,F,J,I have an ISFJ friend who is really good at learning languages
13294,I,N,F,J,Absolutely great work! I love the details

13307,I,N,F,P,Isnt Edward NVM? He shows manipulative behaviour towards Bella by ordering her around and stuff (first book).
13308,I,N,F,P,"I'm writing a book with a HVM and HVW in it.

The sad reality of my writing is I have never had a Muslim man (I am Muslim myself) act romantic and caring towards me without an overbearing sexual intent."
13309,I,N,F,P,"Just blocked a LVM. 

Apart from that, I'm keeping busy with work, gym and my book. 

Going gym and lifting weights has increased my drive immensely and has made me tempted to try something casual but I know it always ends badly so NOPE."
13310,I,N,F,P,Also you can see their jawline if clean shaven or stubble!!!
13311,I,N,F,P,"No unfortunately he doesnt. He only has sisters :(((((

I'm gonna die alone 😇"
13312,I,N,F,P,"Finish your degree. You are much smarter than most of the men you will meet. 

Also men are trash."
13313,I,N,F,P,"I had a friend who did anal sex for the first time due to insistence from her boyfriend. 

She said it was painful and dumped him. He confessed he loves anal porn and how it hurts the woman. 

Any time a guy asks for anal sex RUN."
13314,I,N,F,P,I THREW UP IN MOUTH
13315,I,N,F,P,Dating sites during lockdown are a cesspool. I'm never going back on them again.
13316,I,N,F,P,Bro a 8 clean shaven. Rock that and have a good dress sense.
13317,I,N,F,P,"Just a side note when pickmes ask me why I go for guys with either a six pack or a flat stomach and a handsome face (sharp jawline, nice eyes and head full of hair). I'm a size 6 and I go gym every two days. I have been told I am above average attractiveness so idk - why would I go for a dad bod, short guy and average face? 


It's not a Sherlock case. Make it make sense. 🧐"
13318,I,N,F,P,"knew a guy in college (we had the same class) and we knew each other for 4 years. We went on two dates after I confessed I liked him and then he had to go study medicine in Bulgaria  in Jan 2016. He was 21, I was 20. He told me it would be 6 years and he would only come back to London once or twice every year. I tried doing long distance when he first settled but he got busy and made up excuses.When he didnt message me for 3 months, I got fed up and I cut him off and told him all the best.

He blocked me on facebook and my number for 4 WHOLE YEARS. It took me 2 years to get over him. 

I couldnt sleep the whole night that just went. He messaged me today and has unblocked me. He says he wants to talk as friends and he took a photo of the birthday card I drew for him 6 years ago saying it was so amazing and that I am wonderful...

We are probably two completely different people now. He will come back to London next year.

He said ""Yo its ****. I don't like how our friendship ended. You got me into anime and I want to talk about all the anime I have seen now with you. Just if that's good with you and you just want to be friends then sure. If you are going get upset any time I flirt with a girl then maybe we should stay friends."" 

So yeah I blocked him. 🧚‍♀️"
13319,I,N,F,P,Scroll up hun. I updated. ❤
13320,I,N,F,P,"He assumed I still liked him after 4 years and was being an arrogant asshole. 

And he didnt even ask about me or how I was."
13321,I,N,F,P,"He said ""Yo its ****. I don't like how our friendship ended. You got me into anime and I want to talk about all the anime I have seen now with you.

So yeah I blocked him."
13322,I,N,F,P,I blocked him. Thank you for your kind advice ❤
13323,I,N,F,P,"Last year I was with a NVM who never got me any thoughtful gifts or paid attention to what I liked.

 I try to treat myself at least once a week! Yesterday I got a preserved rose for my bedroom.  


By next May 2021 I should have achieved these things:

-Finish writing my book - 80k word count and I am at 15k word count

-Get a job secured and signed contract in UAE

-Read a new book a week


-Go gym every two days and leg press 150kg - am at 107kg"

I've seen other videos of him - it just seems kinda cringey."

13329,I,N,F,P,Yes it was lovely :)
13330,I,N,F,P,no
13331,I,N,F,P,"Nope I'm the exact same. I'm from the south asian community and am Muslim too.  

My mother and older sister say I'll never find the perfect combo of handsome and smart in a Muslim guy. That I'll die alone. I deleted the apps - I didnt like anyone and a lot of LV/NV men. 

Now I am just enjoying my life. If I meet a man in real life and I like him, sure I'll go on a date. But I am no longer killing myaelf over finding a husband."

13340,I,N,F,P,"Home update: 

My mum announced to me last that she is seeking a divorce from my dad after 27 years. 

She showed me the letter she gave to him. Turns out my grandmother forced my mum to marry my dad because she found out my mum's pakistani boyfriend wanted to marry her. My mum does not love my dad. Tbh my dad is a good and mild mannered guy but he is a terrible LV husband to her. 

 Please keep my family in your prayers as I'm going through a very tough and confusing time at home. 

I love both my parents and if my mum wants to seperate from my dad after a lot of thinking, I have chosen to fully support her. 

Thank you  ❤


In other news, I have been busy looking up my job oppurtunities for UAE next year. I want to save 100k in 4 years. Marriage is not on my mind anymore and an amazing HVM would have to change that. My 25th birthday is coming up so I'm looking at things to treat myself!"

Im not really looking for anyone now Ive decided to move abroad next year. Might as well be rich and alone."

13346,I,N,F,P,Yes that was my only issue with the video
13347,I,N,F,P,"A lot of my south asian sisters get a lot of shit for not wanting to get married asap. 

Maybe south asian communities should focus on the lack of respect and proprierty by dusty south asian men to the young women. Instead of telling women that they should look for a husband and drop their standards, they should get the men to raise their status both mentally and physically. 

Just told my uncle about my plans of going abroad to teach in the UAE (pay is 45k+ a year which is double what I get now) and might not return to London ever. He said if I leave it too late I will become a lonely old spinster. Keep chatting shit uncle. 🤮

All men have ever given me is a headache and lots of harassment. 

I'm not a project for super religious Muslim as they want to turn me into a hijabi barbie for them and I'm not in the mood to mess around with low value liberal Muslim men."

 Found out he is LVM. Blocked after 3rd date.

Said that saying sweet things/cute names to someone he is dating is ""too much"". 

Literally didn't talk for 50% of the date. Blamed it on his introversion. I had 3 guys in the restaurant stare at my date like he was an idiot."

13360,I,N,T,J,INTJ & INFP ship when?
13361,I,N,T,J,"Yes,especially in group situations,but almost never when 1v1"
13362,I,N,T,J,"well i’m still a teen but the reasons i’ve seen so far are: - the person doesn’t want their illusion shattered -they may be interested in the discussion but not have the time or energy -they want to hear it from someone else -bias against specific arguments (try telling most christians what stephen hawking theorized about god’s existence ). -this one i have no research for but i also think people are afraid to be outcasted if their beliefs differ from the group’s (probably especially the case in like a high school environment)

(edit since this got me thinking while taking a shit) : 
different types of poeple of course ,but even then i don’t see having a weakness as a reason not to try (because different types have different strengths- so i do note not everyone is up for philosophy or why their generation is doing something wrong etc etc.)
But the sheepish nature of people makes that we want a group and when someone differs from our group skepticism kicks in real fast , whether it be us INTJs not understanding whimsical people or the other way around ,,that could be a reason people avoid hard questions because they may consider it unnecessary, same as which i for example consider parties unnecessary if there’s not a specific reason for me to go (say friends going or to meet new ones or because someone i know wants to go)

One last one : it could be a case of identity , i lived with a narcissistic stepdad , and what i learnt from that is that sometimes the irrationality has a deeper root ,say the argument is religion as example , he would then feel threatened personally as if religion is wrong then he has no salvation - and that being a reality is too much for him to deal with"

13452,E,N,F,P,Do it with someone else. You can motivate each other and talk to stay awake.
13453,I,N,T,P,"Agree. I saw for the first time a girl that was going to be my roommate. I didn't know she was gonna be my roommate but when I saw her, I instantly didn't like her. She had a bad bitch face. Guess what, we shared room and she did some shitty things to me after all... 
After some time I realized that probably I can read people better than I think and before I was thinking, you can't judge people by their appearance. But now, I think I can read people, I usually know what people I'm gonna get along with, and I follow my intuition better now."
13454,I,N,T,P,I think a realistic INTP would never achieve to be a scientist because it's too much work and effort. Maybe INTP-A. But definitely not an INTP-T. I'm an INTP-T. I've been good at science and I loved technology. I don't know why I ended up doing communications degree and my brain is too logical to do that. And now I'm fucked up. So I'm lost in life lol
13455,I,N,T,P,"I think it doesn't work like that. In Europe housing is really expensive. It doesn't matter if it's a shitty city, the house prices are really expensive... You can't save money because you spend every penny on expenses, taxes, food, transportation (which can be really expensive too)... So basically you can't safe money but you still live in a shitty city."
13456,I,N,T,P,"I don't know. Usually the people that most get me and understand me are Scorpios, maybe because of my 3rd house in Scorpio and stellium in 8th house... 
I feel like they understand my depth and I understand their depth. It depends on the Scorpio but If they're advanced and not toxic, they're amazing. I also drawn in my emotions... I feel like they invade me and I need time to rest to deal with my emotions. I also need alone time and even feel like I'm hiding somewhere so that I feel safe... 
I've met many fire signs and they're usually pretty much positive... Like, when I get sad I literally fall from where I am and I become depressed and I enter into the darkness, into hell... Then I need some time to come out lol. But I feel like fire and air signs don't have this. They recover easily and they feel less pain because they're not sensitive. For example, I feel like aquarius or Leos or sags are not sensitive at all... I'm hypersensitive... a sensitive person can't be rough with their words or can't get along with everyone... And Leos and air signs or sags usually get along with everyone."
13457,I,N,T,P,"I feel like people complain so much about shit I don't find that sad. I went through a lot of shit and I only empathize with things I went through... I can't empathize with you complaining about your boyfriend, or about romantic stuff. I freaking hate it. They're lucky to even have a romantic partner so I can't empathize with them lol... There are many energetical vampires. So I don't let people complain with me nor tell me their problems. I'm too good for them, I don't fake my emotions, but they do. They can talk for 4 hours and complain and cry and shit and you give them all your energy and then they feel great and you feel tired and empty. I don't give my shoulder easily like that. I'm not no one's therapist. If people have problems I always advise them to go to a therapist. I don't want to be their shoulder to cry on..."
13458,I,N,T,P,"I don't know if you know MBTI but I'm an INTP, Aries sun Virgo rising Libra moon, aries mercury. I'm intuitive. But I'm not a feeler. I don't like dealing with people's emotions, though I'm really empathetic so I don't know how to explain that. I just don't empathize with some people because I find them fake. But I'm much more deeper than other fire or air signs I know. Maybe it's because I have stellium in 8th house. I don't get along with superficial people like some Leos, sags, libras, etc."
13459,I,N,T,P,I'm a really sensitive aries. I have Libra moon and virgo Rising. But I'm quite sensitive myself. I hate it when some Aries are just really selfish and childish and don't give a shit about people's feelings but then you say something to them and they get offended. Don't say shit if you're not gonna be able to take the response... Also they're too stubborn and egocentric. Mostly Aries men. They're just DUMB sometimes hahaha... I guess my Virgo rising and my Libra moon kind of hate aries traits lol
13460,I,N,T,P,They can't control their monkey instincts...
13461,I,N,T,P,The key is to be maskless while you're still wearing a mask lmao
13462,I,N,T,P,"Yeah it's true. The boys I like usually date girls that are quite submissive and really cute, submissive way cute. Like, a lot of them couldn't live without a man. And then I think, Should I be a submissive bitch so guys will date me?? And I don't want to be a woman like that. There are many women out there that have suffered a lot because of their submissive attitude and I don't want to be like that."
13463,I,N,T,P,Yeah wtf. Why would anyone be intimidated??
13464,I,N,T,P,"Lol but he can't win an Emmy because he didn't play anything amazing or weird, he doesn't have incredible acting skills, and also he's just playing a normal character. It's not like a series about killers or The Big Bang theory where they do more acting or something... Ted's character is really basic... The end ruined everything. They didn't need a happy ending but definetly the show was a comedy show and they can't turn in into a tragedy in 40 minutes of the last episode."
13465,I,N,T,P,"Well you know the camera is not really about megapixels but colors, lense distortion... Etc. Chinese phones usually suck at cameras and mostly at selfie cameras... Samsung even though not being Chinese I think it takes shitty pics to people. I think Oppo is probably the best one in those prices."
13466,I,N,T,P,It looks like the 4a. It doesn't look premium at all. I'd buy the 4a before the 5.
13467,I,N,T,P,You're so RIGHT!! this is what I needed. Thank you.
13468,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. 

-Fellow INTP haha"
13469,I,N,T,P,"I feel identified with this. As an INTP, what if the mother is an abuser, a narcissist, a terrible mother, she treats her children like shit? We only see one part and it's the agression of the child. But what is the reason? Why would a child be agressive to their parents without a reason??? 
I would not act. And If I acted I would call child services actually."
13470,I,N,T,P,Hahaha as a Boss I would fire him. We don't talk about family at work. Hahaha
13471,I,N,T,P,"Yep. THEY CHOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN. But when you're poor and childfree, you're not choosing that..."
13472,I,N,T,P,"Yeah... When they say thrift shopping is cheaper and you buy real brands... I mean, the prices are the same or even higher to new clothes now. I don't live in the US but elsewhere anywhere it's like that. I don't see buying used clothes if they're gonna be as expensive as new ones."
13473,I,N,T,P,"I think for example Robin in How I met your mother had a great ending. She stayed loyal to her character. I mean, she couldn't have children though and SPOILER:
I hated the end of How I met your mother because Ted gets married and achieves his objective: Getting married and having children. 
SPOILER ALERT: 
The mom dies, and after maybe 40 years??? HE GOES BACK TO ROBIN AGAIN. I find it INCREDIBLY SELFISH from Ted. He just was in love with Robin ALL THE TIME. Even married. And as she couldn't have children, he thought she wasn't the one. But after his wife dying... He gets back to her. THAT'S THE WORST BETRAYAL IN THE WORLD..."
13474,I,N,T,P,"Yep. They never give interesting characters to women. I liked the character of Jodie Foster in the silence of the lambs... She's strong and powerful and a great female character. In the second movie though, Jodie didn't want to play because she falls in love with Hannibal, he escapes or something and they fall for each other. Jodie thought that the character would never do that. See?? It's the same shit always with female characters. They always fuck it up because they romanticize or make women clingy and stupid."
13475,I,N,T,P,"But she ended up doing exactly that, but with the difference that he was a vampire and he had sexual needs towards her blood Lmao it's such a stupid movie hahaha"
13476,I,N,T,P,Well the whole movie was too clingy. And then when the wolf guy did an IMPRENTATION or some shit in the little girl... PEDOPHILIA???? LOL
13477,I,N,T,P,Oh no. I don't want to achieve my 30s. Ever. I'm afraid of this. I'm usually not very social anyways but honestly I don't want to just suddenly meet new people and have to talk to them about children. It's like a nightmare. I guess we need to make groups for child free friendships...
13478,I,N,T,P,"Yes. Now they are advertising the iPhone 12 like the ONLY PHONE THAT HAS 5G. It's annoying. It's almost FRAUD or false advertising. If you listen carefully they have an advertising like: WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS. And it's straight up a lie. They're never the ones that do something first, maybe sometimes, but not always. Only phone with 5g?? What about the only phone that doesn't have a faster screen for nowadays technology while the price is 50% higher? 
Oh and also it's so funny in their ads they say: CALLING, MESSAGING, DOING THIS OR THAT, CLOUD... 
Apple, ANY PHONE CAN DO THOSE THINGS. Only the people that don't know about technology think Apple is a genius inventor."
13479,I,N,T,P,"In Europe is more of the same. Minimum wage 900-1000 Euros. One room in a shared appartement in a city: 600 Euros. So basically you just have 300 Euros for transport, food, expenses... 
Unless you live incredibly far away or in a city that no one wants to live in..."
13480,I,N,T,P,"Uhmn thanks. Yes, I actually MAY have depression. But I know I won't be able to solve my depression because it comes from a problem. As I can't solve that problem because it's physical, I guess I get bitter because I see everything with a negative view... 
I don't think anyone cares about me and I don't think I have to care about anyone either because it only brings pain."
13481,I,N,T,P,"No, I didn't say that. I said that to me, everyone is the same. Every human being is the same and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter the culture because human beings think the same way and act the same way even though being in different countries."
13482,I,N,T,P,I don't think this is unpopular. Just go and look at Instagram. All those fitness girls are hot. They have millions of followers. They have the same opinion as you
13483,I,N,T,P,"I agree. But at the same time, you stay with a bittersweet sensation after watching the movie. I think that sometimes we need that Happy ending. Even though we know in real life it's not like that, that's why it's a movie. It's not real.  I love tragedy ending movies though. Yeah it would be great if just they all ended miserably. Lmao imagine Friends ending like shit. 
I remember I hated the ending of How I met your mother because it was too bittersweet..."
13484,I,N,T,P,My father is a cancer. I don't understand him. I'm an aries. We're completely different. He's negative and really passive. Also he's so weird. I don't know. He's a mysterious man. I'll never understand him.
13485,I,N,T,P,"I'm an aries and I always get along with scorps I don't know how, my friends were always Scorpios. They understand me the best. And they get me the most. Maybe it's because I have my 3rd house in Scorpio and an aries stellium un 8th house."
13486,I,N,T,P,Yep your Scorpio needs some PASSION

13490,I,N,T,P,"Yep I never say anything personal to a gemini. But of course, they even tell basic information about you to everyone. Lol."
13491,I,N,T,P,I'm skinny but I don't have a tiny waist. Skinny women usually are supposed to have more of a rectangular shape. You will never achieve a hourglass figure. Really few women are born with that figure. And if you're tall it's almost impossible you'll have that figure. But whatever. They work out a lot to get those waists I guess.
13492,I,N,T,P,"Obviously insecure women are the ones that most buy shit to look better. Look at how much we waste for beauty: skin care routine, makeup, clothes, hairstyler, hair products, gym, healthy food, supplements... Etc. Everything to look  beautiful. And also women compete between each other all the time. They're jealous and envious of each other a lot of times... That competition makes us want to achieve perfectionism..."
13493,I,N,T,P,They're the responsible of that. No one forces them to edit their pics. They're obsessed with competition and competing between each other. Instagram is like a magazine of girls that promote themselves...
13494,I,N,T,P,A naturally skinny woman doesn't have much curves. Now it looks like girls are skinny and also have slim waists like a needle. It's not usual. But it looks like it's so common because of Instagram
13495,I,N,T,P,What does gen Ed mean?
13496,I,N,T,P,"I agree. Most people I know that study science, they just repeat everything they've studied but can't think of themselves nor have their own opinion. That's exactly the opposite of scientific brain..."
13497,I,N,T,P,Too much talking but no doing.
13498,I,N,T,P,What is real?
13499,I,N,T,P,Lol science and philosophy go by hand... Those questions asked by philosophy are exactly the ones science tries to answer...
13500,I,N,T,P,I think it's not a huge difference but still. I think 99% of the girls on Instagram just fake their bodies. I'm actually sure. I don't believe in anything I see on Instagram.

13576,I,N,T,P,I’m angry at the truth in this.
13577,I,N,T,P,"Hey y’all. My name is Josh, and I used to be a racist.


I was born in 1997 in a majority white town.
Born into a large christian family, with extremely republican parents. If you would have asked me when I was 15 if I was a racist, I would have told you no. Looking back though, I’m ashamed at how I acted. You see, my whole life up until I was 17, I was sheltered from the harsh realities of this world. I had a strange/rough childhood that made me bitters day angry, and to my shame, I took that bitterness and anger out on people of color. I still didn’t think I was a racist. 
My world view started to change when I was 21. I went to Memphis on my way to Tunica MS. I stopped for gas, got out of my car and realized that I was the only white person around. For no reason, I was scared. I left Memphis as soon as I could and later I thought back to that moment and realized that that fear is what people of color feel on a daily basis. That experience is what started my change. A few months later, I got in trouble with the law and landed in jail a couple times. My credit started dropping and before I knew it, I was your typical low income, blue collar worker. I then started getting pulled over more. I drove an old beater car and I realized that the cops were targeting that car. That tiny bit of discrimination I received was yet another turning point for me. I figured out the meaning of white privilege, in that, even with all the times I was stopped by cops, I didn’t have to worry about dying. And now we come to present day. Leading up to the George Floyd murder, I was still shameful quiet on race issues. I can no longer hold my tongue. I have been challenging family members, co-workers and any random person on the internet who will talk to me. I’m not bragging, I’m only saying that I’m trying to do my best. I plan to go to the nearest protest to me as soon as I get the chance. I never realized how rampant racism is in this country until I started having open dialogues with the people around me. It needs to be stopped, and the only way to stop it is to join together and kill this ugly beast once and for all. I apologize for the long story, and if you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. 
No Justice, No Peace! 
Sic Semper Tyrannis!"
13578,I,N,T,P,"In the interest of staying true to the INTP stereotype, I have to say that the correct word is “piqued”. Now that that’s out of the way, on to the story.


It’s really not much of a story though honestly...
The little shit used his extroverted skills to get close to the owner of the company. He then proceeded to spread rumors about me and talk shit about me to the owner, (who I had always been cool with) eventually, he calls the owner one morning and tells him that I had been sitting in the truck the whole day not doing anything. (I should mention that I was the ENFP’s foreman and he hated taking orders from me.)
Anyway, the owner comes out to our job site, and blows up on me, threatens me, then continues on to fire me. That’s where the story ends. Like I said, not much to it, but I don’t like ENFPs now lol"
13579,I,N,T,P,"No offense to you ENFPs, I’m sure y’all are great people, but the only confirmed ENFP I’ve known in person was an over-emotional, pompous, arrogant, childish little twat. He also got me fired from my favorite job. So I have a sore spot against ENFPs lol"

""You don't get it man, after the last round I had to RE-TEACH HER HOW TO READ"" Oh did you? Is that what autism is? Forgetting how to read after you've built a solid foundation? You're saying those with autism can't read? Are you? And do you mean the same daughter who pretended to forget how to count so she could piss off her mom and spend more time with her dad? That daughter?"
13656,I,N,T,P,"Yes, I'm aware of both. I wasn't criticizing you :)"

13660,I,N,T,P,"This does not seem like bad advice but at the company I work for there is the rhetoric of ""you can tell he's just here for a paycheck"" to denote someone who is not dedicated to learning the necessary skills for the job. No one particularly tells these guys to leave if that's what they're there for, but it's still similar or kind of the same right? Our pay and benefits are well above average for the industry; if someone were to suggest that to a new employee, or if someone at another company were to suggest that to me as a new employee, I think I'd just take it as a ""the pay is an attractive trait of this job but if you're only here to collect that pay while doing the bare minimum to not get fired, it's going to show and you're going to slow us down."""
13661,I,N,T,P,"Take a trip to r/conservative, it's even more ridiculous than you think. On top of how much attention they pay to Trump and how much stock they hold in his rhetoric, like 90% of the posts are ""flaired users only""; you have to prove you're a conservative by having an account that mostly comments conservative talking points across Reddit in order to gain a flair by the mods in order to reply, i.e. snowflakes in their safe space."

13666,I,N,T,P,"It is usually young adults who are snarky, smug, and confrontational about it. It does not mean that exceptions are rare, or that atheists of even older age groups aren't shitty about their beliefs, but in a general sense it's the teenagers up to 25ish that are verbally combative about it, and for different reasons too. At some point we grow up just a little and typically adopt a live and let live mentality, at least until someone's religion is openly hurting them or others.

And sometimes an atheist will participate in some religious rituals for their own comfort, even though they (believe they) know better; its what they were raised on and it can be therapeutic.

Other times, like me, you'll find out the atheist says they believe in or otherwise just excitedly participates in things like ghost hunts because science is always expanding and just because we haven't proven ghost sightings are more than willful ignorance or unwitting delusions doesn't mean it isn't true and just has yet to be proven. I absolutely don't believe in ghosts or the supernatural but dammit all if I'm not going to go and try to prove myself wrong.

I digressed! Whoops! My point was, your 26 year old friend is an asshole and when he's 30ish hopefully he's been called am asshole for long enough that he'll be more polite and leave people alone."

13668,I,N,T,P,"This is exactly the way I teach my nephews, nieces, and cousins.

13669,I,N,T,P,"There are ""dirty"" jobs that pay well above minimum wage that only requires a high school education/GED to get started if any education is required at all, but the catch is usually obscene amounts of hours you're expected to work, regardless of weather, and regardless of how muddy, sandy, or dirty you're gonna get. One of those is my job, a non-destructive testing inspector that tests welds for flaws in fabrication shops or industrial plants. The hours can be long, the jobs can be very frustratingly dirty, but it's usually just a stepping stone until you can get certified in an inspection field and get hired for specialty inspections for much higher pay."

13674,I,N,T,P,"Not in the interest of judging you, but I am assuming you're a teenager. The only thing iPhone does better is integrate their software better between devices and they  put a lot of effort into having the best cameras.

Otherwise, the Android operating system and the devices themselves are usually designed to be used optionally as development tools, and that allows experienced crackers an open door into removing all built-in tamper and security features that protect the phone from unwanted intrusion and otherwise general misuse (and some proprietary secrets can sometimes be found too).

In other words, Android phones can more easily become almost anything you want them to be in terms of a radio computer. You can turn them into WiFi sniffing devices, personal radio beacons, and signal interference, you can connect them to computers and use the phone as a root command terminal. It's late and everything else I've done with them is farther back than the tip of my tongue  right now but my point is they have always been 1000% more versatile than iPhones and that's by design for both brands. Apple doesn't want you to fuck with their hardware. The android developers sometimes even encourage you to. Android has a file system that doesn't force you to use proprietary software to interact with your files.

The people who call you a loser for not having an iPhone use their iPhones mostly as status symbols, not because iPhones are better. That's why I mentioned assuming you were a teenager because by mid twenties you don't really hear that childish shit from others anymore. Android phones are now getting to be as pricey as iPhones but in the past having an android could be seen as you settling because you couldn't afford an iPhone, when in truth its just because I can control every computer OS from MacBooks to Windows to Linux with my Android from my couch. I can render your Bluetooth signal useless with a script with android, I can  connect a PS4 controller and record gyroscopic motion data with android. And so very much more."
13675,I,N,T,P,"Man I have so much to say about this but I'll try to keep it short. (TL;DR: People with suicidal thoughts often lack the energy or motivation to follow through, then they take anti-depressants and they receive the energy they needed to follow through. It's really not that the anti-depressants cause suicidal thoughts, but that the thoughts already exist, have existed for a long time and have become a priority, and the drug gives them the ability to act on it)

**Long, scattered version:**
Antidepressants as a name of that class of drugs needs to be changed. There are so many other reasons to take certain anti-depressants that have nothing to do with depression and it's not just a few isolated drugs either.

Anyway, one of the hallmarks of clinical depression is lethargy. A lack of energy (or excitement). It is fairly common for the clinically depressed to sleep abnormally long hours and frequently, it's also common for them to lay on a couch for hours or days with the feeling they're unable to get up to do anything; they lack the energy, motivation, willpower, etc. Couple this with suicidal thoughts and you get a person who has thought about it long enough and have made a plan and how they're gonna do it whenever they get the courage.

When that person decides to see a doctor and get antidepressants, the drug usually takes a few days or sometimes a couple of weeks before the effects are consciously noticed. When the drugs start to work, the plans for suicide suddenly seem more possible to accomplish."
13676,I,N,T,P,"Yes, yes, now there's a trip code. Lots of people made a trip code and tried to be the ""real Q."" One of them was bound to be more convincing than others, and turns out someone was. the original poster is not the same as the person who claims to be Q now."
13677,I,N,T,P,"I didn't say anyone was doing it unknowingly. I said ""Q"" is anyone who wants to write an anonymous post and call themselves Q, and pretty surprising figures have displayed their affinity for QAnon (like the head of the NYPD union). It is no stretch of the imagination that diehard loyalists to Trump that are fast-tracked into governmental positions they have absolutely no experience in would also use their position and closeness to the president to pull a stunt like stirring the QAnon followers into a frenzy knowing how high a pedestal they hold their God King. The entire QAnon lunacy is a narcissist's dream."
13678,I,N,T,P,You have a very loose definition of conspiracy theorist when Trump has proven over and over and over that this is the exact kind of shit he's all about.
13679,I,N,T,P,"Malcolm in the Middle reference, nice."
13680,I,N,T,P,"Nah, lying isn't good considering you want to stay friends. For some dudes, there's nothing you can really say; every woman (that isn't family, usually) that becomes more than just acquaintances has romantic potential for them, and the sooner you recognize this and distance yourself the better. 

For every other guy, you could try this: if you get close enough to see yourself as friends, you directly say some iteration of ""I have spent (x) years in this field and I've met a lot of guys who assume romantic interest when I'm just trying to make friends and be a good friend; since I don't know you very well yet, I'm being up-front: I'm not available."" And gauge their reaction from there. Maybe they say ""duly noted"" and the topic gets changed, maybe they react negatively because their hopes are dashed before they could act on them and voila you've saved time. Maybe they ask what ""not available"" means and maybe you answer honestly (whether you're dating someone or just not interested in dating anyone at all), maybe you tell them it doesn't matter because regardless of what ""not available"" means, you're still not available (ie, just because you're not available while single doesn't mean you won't start dating someone later and then be not available while not single and that's none of their business).

Is it awkward? Hell yes it is. It sucks that it has to come down to forcing discomfort, but in the end the dude either makes it known he's not interested in you as a friend and you'll have saved time & energy or he sticks around because he is interested in you as a friend and you've made a friend. It is infinitely more awkward when I do it, though because I'm the guy it is more about their reassurance, like ""I know it can be a problem when making guy friends that out of the blue they've assumed romantic interest and make that your problem, and I just wanna say preemptively that it's not something you'll have to deal with here."" But it's led me to two of my best friends. Maybe imagining that will cancel out any awkwardness if you decide to try it.

I saw the other commenter that assumes that the majority of guys do not believe there can be a platonic relationship between men and women and just from my experiences personally, I wholly disagree; there are definitely very many guys that believe this, it's not an uncommon find, but it's absolutely not the majority. I place it at 20%, maybe 25%, which to be fair is still way too many. You also have the disadvantage of being in a field that is rife with that particular kind of nurtured personality. 

In any case, you have my sympathy, and either way, good luck!"
13681,I,N,T,P,"Are you kidding? The QAnon lunatics think Trump is a national crime fighting hero, I promise you he eats that shit up. That Trump gets to be a publically secret spy fighting against the villainous deep-state in the eyes of these people strokes his ego more tenderly than Stormy Daniels stroked his chode.

Considering the garbage Trump surrounds himself with, I absolutely believe one of his aides is a 4chan troll & QAnon idiot impersonating the fictional Q, and either secretly unbeknownst to Trump or at Trump's specific behest is in the same room while Trump sends out tweets, knowing he's just stoking the fire to reinforce the loyalty of his cult."

13685,I,N,T,P,"This! Who tf would ever think they're an exclusive couple without having a conversation about it?? This is what's troubling to me. Not just the asshat who made the assumption, but all of the other guys who even superficially sympathized with him didn't even think to ask him ""Well, did you ask if she was interested in dating? Because friends helping friends doesn't sound like a romantic invitation to me""

That should have been the first question by everyone else on that call."
13686,I,N,T,P,"Idk man, my gaming laptop cost me $2000 and I can still do objectively more with a $1000 Android flagship. They're tiny computers you can take anywhere and do almost anything practical with that a laptop can."
13687,I,N,T,P,"Considering this whole ordeal was being covered up and buried as a routine drug investigation gone awry, you can bet they have also been trying to bury evidence"
13688,I,N,T,P,"QAnon ""High Priest"" Was Just Trolling Away as a Citigroup Tech Executive  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-07/who-is-qanon-evangelist-qmap-creator-and-former-citigroup-exec-jason-gelinas](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-07/who-is-qanon-evangelist-qmap-creator-and-former-citigroup-exec-jason-gelinas)

Even the QAnon higher ups are lunatics. This dude made $3000 a month to operate the Q drop website, a senior tech executive at Citigroup, the leading global bank. Not some government agent, not some political avenger, a dude getting paid to help run a division in a massive corporation, billion dollar corporations like that are at the heart of ""deep state"" conspiracies. This dude's career position is a textbook enemy of QAnon supporters and he was running the QMap site. It was never about actually fighting a shadow deep state organization, it was always about trolling an anonymous forum and it got out of control."
13689,I,N,T,P,"No, you're making them line up. These messages are from different people following the same format to troll idiots and entertain everyone else. The subsequent 3 or 4 ""verified"" messages did not line up with the grammar or format of the first, and the third and fourth didn't match up with the grammar or format of the second, before the """"""Q DROPS """""" became more standardized, and the even poorly formed ones just didn't pick up traction. It's a very common idea that trolls on 4chan have used for two decades, this one just accidentally got out of control.

If someone was serious on spilling these secrets they'd have at the VERY least used a method of identifying they're the real Q and not another copycat. 4chan has a free system of generating secure tripcodes, but the person clearly did not expect this shit to take off like it did, no foresight required.

Anyone with an ounce of creativity can take a recent happening, two happenings in the recent past, and one to three happenings in the more distant past and string them together with bullshit and have a conspiracy theory that sounds plausible when you refuse to exercise critical thinking."
13690,I,N,T,P,"Yep. I misunderstood your initial statement, but yes, I've read those posts."
13691,I,N,T,P,"Yes, because if I don't agree with you I'm just parroting the news. This is the kind of logic that has you believing in QAnon brother."
13692,I,N,T,P,"""a true INTP"" sounds pretty exclusionist, I'd be careful there friend.

Every personality type is a spectrum of traits; that INTPs have a Si+Fe combo means there are going to be some INTPs who not only see the value of, but also believe in the value of social standings. I agree that it's a very telling trait of an INTP for them not to, but it's more like a common trait with outliers rather than one that can exclude a person from the type if they feel otherwise.

Also, as a social species, we all (in general) care what others think. Who is involved and is excluded in that list is generally the determining factor."
13693,I,N,T,P,"Guarantee you those ""drops"" are intentional polling of the least likely demographics to have been exposed to it"
13694,I,N,T,P,I think you have INFPs and INFJs mixed up with INTPs

i'm currently on a Wellbutrin (an NDRI) prescription to help me recover from burnout and depression.

To reduce the global population in a predictable, controlled and orderly fashion?

[This is the official reason](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/) the World Economic Forum is giving. They literally call it ""the great reset"".

FYi, the World Economic Forum, in case you don't know them, those are the people organizing those annual meetings at Davos. They split from the Bilderberg Group a few decades ago and seem to have been heavily involved in social engineering during the last decade!

However, by modifying your actions you actually can slowly begin to modify your mind set and self view in many ways. So by doing things like looking around his post history the way a suspicious SO would, one affirms to themselves subconsciously that a reason exists to think that way.

Something you could do is write down every single time in your phone notes any moment you feel compelled to do an action that's driven by your insecurity in your relationship (ie: check his social history, ask about some girl, etc). By doing this you'll start to quantify just how often your insecurities are manifesting through your behavior and what types of behavior that is. Overtime if you purposefully stop yourself from engaging in those behaviors, that will begin to negatively reinforce any insecurities that are causing such behavior. At least that's an example of how a cognitive-behavioral therapist might go about it. I'm a Masters of counseling psychology but not licensed at the moment nor do I truly know your situation so you technically shouldn't take my advice as a professional opinion, rather just a possible suggestion.

Either way they are wrong in their behavior towards you because such gender expectations are based on ignorance. Are you friendly with your older brother? I know that every time there was something that my parents where not able to help me with I would rely on my older sister who was also four years older to me. She became a real rock I could rely on in those times. If your parents will not come around and understand that you like games and you have the right to like them then maybe your brother will help you and equally share the games with you since he's the only one getting them from their parents. I know that's not ideal but it's better than not getting any games at all until you can afford to get your own and move out.

I'm sorry your parents views are getting in the way of your hobbies but it's always possible that over time they may come around and change a little bit. I know I was able to change my father's opinions on some of my hobbies as I got older but there's no guarantee.

That type of advice is how you end up getting that 20% elsewhere and then losing the 80% you had initially and ending up in a shittier situation.

He doesn't seem like a very visceral person, at least physically. He might simply perceive acts of sex in a different way from OP and not naturally get into them as passionately as she does. I think she needs to talk to him and describe the emotion, passion and engagement that she's looking for more so than any singular action because otherwise he will probably just try to do that action like a robot.

13831,E,N,F,P,"If you want to start building friendships and relationships outside of yourself, while he states that your relationship is the only one he needs, then I greatly suggest you asked him to start doing group activities with you. Now whether that means you both joining some type of an activity or hobby related club, volunteering at the same establishment or any other social place that you both can be together while meeting other people. This way he can begin to craft relationships with others while holding on to his relationship with you at the same time since that may be very important.

Of course the current virus situation really puts a damper on that but I would recommend you to keep this in mind because it doesn't have to be in person. There are other ways that you can do group activities with him and meet new people without having to break social distancing. You can also introduce him some of your Social Circle as well"
13832,E,N,F,P,"And then after Anna dressed as Silver whoops Stu ass, the next week forward Silver just acts like it was him all along.

Silver: don't make me wreck you again Stu

Stu: wtf are you talking about. You never wrecked me

Silver: Did I give you that much brain damage last week?

Stu: wtfffff"
13833,E,N,F,P,"I use a Phillips trimmer, nothing special but good quality. I have a bunch of electric trimmers lying around since I've always had a beard for the past ~15 years. So whenever I retire a trimmer from my face due to buying a newer one, it goes to being a ""body"" trimmer. That way you don't need to buy one specifically for groin or pits.

One big suggestion I recommend is to buy an electric razor that comes with guard sizes because some trimmers are unexpectedly sharp. I've cut myself before trimming to close and cuts on the folds of scrotum are no Bueno. So I recommend using a 1-2mm guard at first to guage how sharp your trimmer is and then work a closer shave from there if you so choose"

13836,E,N,F,P,People love to bash on Meltzer when he's basically the only pro wrestling reporter with a shred of integrity & has been before most us this sub were born
13837,E,N,F,P,"No worries, you good."
13838,E,N,F,P,"You right. I put the ""if you want to look at it in that way"" at the end of my comment for that reason. It's not a particularly good way of looking at things in general."
13839,E,N,F,P,The world is objectively better due to people who get s*** done in life so ESTJ probably are one of the most important types that we have existing if we really want to look at it in that way

13843,E,N,F,P,"The coolest wrestlers of the past 20 years all just kneed the shit out of people. Kenta, Marafuji but also bald era Keji Mutoh & rock star era Nakamura. Those were the coolest Japanese stars & modern indies was built on being puroresu marks lol. Even in WWE you see shining wizards constantly."
13844,E,N,F,P,"Ain't nothing like some nice Fried chicken, Mac, corn bread & an Ice tea/lemonade straight to the face after a long day at work."
13845,E,N,F,P,"Also how his resting heart rate was initially 80+ but after testing with her, his heart rate remains elevated at 110+. So Himuro not only has the highest peak & sustained heart rate but she also has the highest net heart rate gain. If you examine the shape of the heart rate pattern for the 2nd & 3rd ladies you see they have a pretty sustained line that bounces up & down. But Himuros pattern had a lower number which shoots up extremely high about 1/4 of the way through the test. This indicates Yukimura might have had some subconscious response after patting Himuro head for a while which shot his heart rate up (aka he likes her).

I'm surprised they put that much depth into some dumb comedy gag scene but it's definitely funny to see those details in the graph since I work in research myself."
13846,E,N,F,P,"I love how only Japan thinks stuff like ""let's make a pandering waifu fantasy anime for introverted lonely science bois that can subliminally teach them the proper elements of research design & the scientific method"""
13847,E,N,F,P,"Oh yea you right, he did make some sd card of evidence Ogino cheated but he also referred to himself as having a naive ""overbearing sense of justice"". So again Ishigami's action in the whole Ogino/Ootomo situation isn't praised by the story. It's part of his arc towards growth & developing actual relationships. 

If you really think Ishigami was gonna go find Ootomo & tell him the truth idk what exactly to say. She basically represents the most traumatic incident of his school years. You think he was gonna go search her out and tell her after he stubbornly refused to write those apologies that entire middle school year? Nah that just wouldn't make sense realistically. Not to mention he also had 0 confidence as an individual uptil maybe 6 months ago in story line time. The idea he should go tell her the truth is honorable-ish but not something any 16 year old would ever do for someone who goes to a different school & whom they'll probably never see again. It's not much of a blame able thing. 

As for your last part of your comment, literally every character in this story has done tons of problematic things if you look at it that way. The entire false rumor thing can be considered very problematic. Kaguya, Fuji, & Ishi (sometimes Shirogane) do problematic shit almost every chapter. He was desperate but ultimately he did accept her no for an answer. There was never any refusal."
13848,E,N,F,P,The part I agree with you on is they should have been letting him get some singles matches during Dynamite to rack up couple wins. I love seeing Eddie on TV so keeping him in this spot is perfecto with me. They need his promo ability to keep engagement while fans aren't there. I just wish they let him get some wrestling time to go with the mic time to sell his ability prior to the title shot. But it was probably a late game booking switch when they decided that Eddie would do an extended program with Mox so I guess there wasn't much choice
13849,E,N,F,P,Crazy how a freaking gag joke comedy manga slowly turned into this much of a heart churner. I don't think anyone would have expected that the 2 main characters would actually start dating only mid way through the story hs wise and then it would turn to heartfelt relationship problems concerning the younger characters. This was supposed to be a comedy so when did it become a drama lol.
13850,E,N,F,P,"Ishigami did not have any sd card full of evidence. He was afraid if ratted Ogino out to Ootomo, then Ogino would respond by leaking Ootomos nudes. So being a naive middle schooler he white knighted for her instead of doing something wiser. They discuss how his reaction wasn't the best reaction in hindsight. Also many of his unsavory attitudes towards women where literally part of his character Arc. The whole thing about him going from the introverted semi incel character who has some misogynistic ideas and hates Romance who then begins to change once they actually make friends and the game more human interaction is a mad common trope. That trope is straight what Oreigaru was based on in entirety lolol. But Ishigami has corrected many of his former ignorant views on women over the past ~100 chapters as he made friends for the first time in his life and realized his faults through experience. It's solid writing."
13851,E,N,F,P,"To be fair, I've called Obama all sorts of stuff like George Bush 2.0, Abu Dronestrike (daddy drone strike in Arabic), and other not nice things however I'd put an Opossum in office before I'd ever even consider voting for Trump. Then again I've said some good things here and there about Obama in the past, mostly about his charisma and speaking ability. My criticism has always been policy related. Trump however has a dirty personality which he doesn't even care to hide."

13866,E,N,T,J,"Then you don’t understand what it’s like for a male. We have much more testosterone which messes with our sexual urges it’s not as simple as “control yourself and don’t be disgusting” of course I wouldn’t look on purpose, and if you’re a teenager you also start having hormonal changes due to puberty and those hormonal changes cause you to be more “horny” I wish it was as easy as not being a pervert or something. There was an article about a woman who became a male and when he was taking testosterone he reported that he had way more urges and he was ashamed of himself."
13867,E,N,T,J,Are you by any chance a teenage male?
13868,E,N,T,J,"I haven’t gotten that far, so idk maybe"
13869,E,N,T,J,"I think I also read something about that, he started taking testosterone and had way more urges correct?"
13870,E,N,T,J,Yes exactly

13879,E,N,T,J,You very accurately figured me out...
13880,E,N,T,J,That’s extremely true! I would lay my life down protecting those I care about! The everyone sucks part is also true! You can’t have an amazing team if you think your team sucks! I make an effort to blatantly point out my teammates strengths and weaknesses and mold each other so that all of our weaknesses are covered by someone else’s strengths! That’s what a good leader should be able to do!
13881,E,N,T,J,Same here but I didn’t think I was an ENFJ I’m just loyal and “fight” for justice as well.
13882,E,N,T,J,What are some creature comforts? (School has burnt my brain and I can’t think of any)
13883,E,N,T,J,"I personally think after a certain point money becomes worthless and power should be sought after just have limits about it and stand close to your moral compass! You should become and rich and powerful with others! Not by discarding others and being selfish you have to have a good base! (That base being people who trust and believe in you and that you have their interests in mind) Also the being controlling thing brings more enemies than friends, in my opinion is wrong because I have lots of close friends and people who are somewhat close to me and it’s not because I’m controlling and manipulative it’s because they like me and I like them."
13884,E,N,T,J,I’m in a similar boat
13885,E,N,T,J,I have a friend (I assume he’s an INFP gonna make him take the test today) and this is literally our relationship lol

My father overheard me with my friend on the phone and told me afterwards how disappointed he was, because he always taught me to respect everyone no matter what. I felt pretty bad, which doubled when I found out the guy actually cried because of me.

I apologized and never did it again. It was so shitty that now I'm embarrassed just thinking about it."
14008,I,N,T,J,I still do it 😂
14009,I,N,T,J,"Dude friends-to-lovers is probably the best way for INTJ. We have far more important things to do with our time then.. mingle.

14011,I,N,T,J,"Damn, it still is. I've never been in long, solid relationships actually. I'm bi as well, so with men it was less of a problem, though I'm less interested. With the ladies, though.. it came from them. 

Uh. The gym is the only place people try to talk to me. And since I don't like to talk and work out, you can imagine how my love life are going haha.

The only time I confessed was when I was 18, and it felt like a terrible mistake because we were both bad for each other."
14012,I,N,T,J,Interesting point. It's frustrating sometimes as a woman being in a relationship with another woman. I come across as insensitive more than I'd like to admit.

I change small things every now and then, though.

But, as a writer, don't forget one simple thing. It's first about the core, then everything else. Not everyone think/feel the same regardless their gender or where they came from.
Go with the flow of the personality, motives and the character's background story (is the character came from a house where the father is driven by ego? Maybe he's a natural leader? The mother was harsh or caring?).
It will fall into place just like that.

Aside from it, my advice is to go r/askMen and read some posts."

14053,E,N,T,J,"In a work context this is the type that ENTJ trusts to complete tasks that it cannot do itself, and tasks it does not WANT to do (detail orientation, excessively practical tasks)."
14054,E,N,T,J,"There has to be a new generation of ENTJs are something because all I see in this subreddit is apologetics and a desperation to be regarded as ""emotionally intelligent."""
14055,E,N,T,J,How do ENTPs even keep a girlfriend? lmao
14056,E,N,T,J,"I don't know you're even pretending, just put a Lion for ENTJ"
14057,E,N,T,J,I wouldn’t base choosing a partner on type. There are ENTJs I like a lot and ENTJs I strongly dislike. Same with INTJ. My best relationship was with an ESTP which MBTI would advise against. Typology is only so useful. I don’t rely on it beyond trying to gain a quick understanding of how a person processes things in a work context (Am I dealing with Te or Ti? Fe or Fi?). Relationships are a whole other animal.
14058,E,N,T,J,"I take a general issue with ENTJ descriptions precisely because they posit ""efficiency"" and ""results"" as ends, in and of themselves. As having profound and ultimate meanings, in and of themselves. I'm not sure if that's making sense, and whenever I try to explain this people act as if I'm speaking a strange language. Efficiency, results, numbers, stats, achievements -- you cannot find satisfaction and fulfillment in these things alone unless you're a machine lacking consciousness . . . 

What is the actual aim here? What is the actual purpose of a life? When you look at our celebrity lists: Napoleon, Caesar and all the rest didn't sit at their table scribbling and chanting ""ResultsResultsResultsResults,"" there was a sense of higher calling and purpose. They were seeking results towards a specified end. They were trying to DO something large and important. Something profoundly deep and meaningful.

Current ENTJ descriptions want us to go into a corporation and work like lab rats until we die without thinking about it . . . and when we do think about it, be okay with it because we were ""efficient"" and got ""results."" I can't see Te-Ni-Se-Fi not seeing through this. Whatever. Overcoming burnout. Why are you doing what you are doing? Have you chosen the right goal? Will the end result truly satisfy you, or does it just look impressive on paper or when rattled off at some meeting? Burnout submits to a why and wherefore, burnout submits to purpose."
14059,E,N,T,J,"Advice from a 28 year old . . . I would be twice as far in my progression as a person and in my profession had I not dated. You are asking for a major distraction to enter your life. They will ask OR demand that you siphon time away from your activities and center it on them. Even if you do that, you need to understand that drama WILL occur -- NO MATTER WHAT -- and this will eat up your time. It will eat up your time directly (arguing, tending to feelings, healing feelings, etc.) and indirectly (you're stressed, thinking about the situation, it is hampering your performance, etc.). 

You need to structure your life in such a way that you can AFFORD to allot time, effort, emotional availability and all of that to another person. You need to literally arrange your responsibilities, obligations and hobbies so that there is considerable SPACE for you to have a relationship and deal with the unpredictable aspects of it as well. 

>**Do you have any regrets in your dating life? What would you have told your 16 y/o self about dating?**

I'm sure reddit will crucify me for this but whatever. Right now, I refuse to be in a relationship. I enjoy the company of women, I enjoy going out on dates, but I make it very clear to them that I will not date or commit exclusively. I never have relationship drama because they second they overstep or begin negatively impacting my life I simply boot them out. And I can do that because I never got excessively attached via a relationship in the first place. Now you don't have to follow this approach at all. But do understand that you do not NEED to date to get this sort of fulfillment. You could even find hat fulfillment in friendship."

It is the Will to Power that unifies his work, Will to Power is the common undercurrent that is active beneath it all, it is through Will to Power that we are best able to understand his work as an organic or even sequential whole."

It is a last resort when an ENTJ decides “I must now CONVINCE these people to not do something disastrous.” It usually means we have exhausted other options or that some authority or ideal or concept is being followed on the basis of dubious logic or emotionalism.

14097,E,N,T,J,"If you think like a little bitch, you’ll be a little bitch!"
14098,E,N,T,J,"No, incorrect. The Death of God has nothing to do with the existence or nonexistence of God, nor anything to do with atheism for that matter. It has to do with ***belief in God being unable to give life meaning and value.*** This is why Nihilism must necessarily follow. Our enlightenment, philosophy, and scientific revolutions killed God in the first place and we now find ourselves realizing that those very things are unable to play the role that God did. Hence frustration --> fear --> pessimism --> nihilism --> collapse of culture. 

Now in BGE, WTP and in small snippets elsewhere Nietzsche further explains that our secular isms mimic God and Christian morality but this further agitates our cultural nihilism because they are inadequate at creating values and assigning meanings. We have advanced too far to not see through any value and meaning given from without. The religious approach can no longer WORK. Yes, people are still religious, people still go to church. But people do not go into the backyard and have a Joan of Arc experience and blind men don't see images of God's will and the future.

That is what is meant by God no longer being able to give life meaning and value. And this is also behind one of his most critical concepts -- that I see criminally ignored -- the revaluation of values. In bulk and across the entire body of his work, what Nietzsche is trying to do is . . . reverse the valuations that undid ancient Greco-Roman ones . . . and promote the emergence of an \[over\]man that wouldn't need God to assign him meaning and value anyway -- because he himself creates his own and lives by them. We become Gods ourselves."

14100,E,N,T,J,"Similar experience on my end. 

I’m detecting in this thread especially a deep fear of the type being considered “mean,” or “not nice” — hence drinking the “emotional intelligence” kool-aid, associating happiness with social acceptance and platitude, blah blah. 

I am further recalling the times of crisis I’ve had at work, the fact that I was asked to resolve these crises (not the nice guys or nice women) and that my no-nonsense style has gained me the trust of people in high places ... and as you allude to friendship evolves out of mutual respect for each other’s merit and ability. I trust who I trust at work because we’ve been in the trenches together fighting, not because they smile, kiss ass, and try to be friendly to the point of seeming servile."
14101,E,N,T,J,I deeply doubt that the people in this thread have actually had to play the corporate game or have climbed any sort of meaningful career ladder . . . being liked does not count for much.

14119,E,N,T,P,Well we have to go by the letters. First off introverts are the first bad letter because they're stupid and should just go out and talk to people. It's not that hard. Sensors are obviously awful so yeah. Thinkers are better than feelers because feelers are weak and weird and perceivers are better than judgers because I said so. So that means the worst type is ISFJ also meaning ENTP is the best type because it's the exact opposite. But we already knew ENTP was the best type so it doesn't matter.

14155,E,N,T,P,"I CAUGHT MY OWN BOYFRIEND being a creep. The summer after we both graduated from high school, we went and got acai bowls and sat side by side. I was wearing those dolphin shorts that are short but pretty loose. Later on that evening, we were looking at memes on his Instagram when he suddenly pressed the upload button, which showed that his recent camera roll consisted of at least 20 pictures of my upper thighs and crotch area from earlier that day!!! I was 18 and confused on why my boyfriend of 7 months (we had never had sex before) would do that to me. I was so troubled about it, didn't know how to feel, so two weeks later I dumped him. Some of his friends thought it was okay because he was my boyfriend, but eventually some coworkers convinced me that it is NOT okay. Nowadays, I tell guys this story to see their reaction and how they think about it as a way to test their respect.

he also admitted to taking pictures of other girls' asses as well, but that all ""changed"" when he started dating me. he is also a super Christian guy with his parents being church officials."
14156,E,N,T,P,"first of all my boyfriend hates being called an INFJ, but he is an INFJ. and I am an ENTP and he's liked me from the start. the mutual attraction began with my eagerness and shamelessness to do whatever random idea pops into my head. on day 1 he told me I was charming. entp are the type of people to be good at a lot of random subjects and work themselves to exertion over things they are passionate for. he once told me I'm like a ""new and improved human being"" just because I cook every meal so deliciously.

also I feel like I need infj so they can remind me to drink water. I can provide infj with reasons for whatever they are trying to prove."
14157,E,N,T,P,what is this place and how did I get added to this subreddit and what is it for
14158,E,N,T,P,"date an ENTP girl, find her boldly challenging the teachers contradictory lecture, and then send her a private message in the zoom chat during lecture and let her know whether you agree with her or not. if you disagree with what she did, joke with her and let her know. if you do agree, give a props to her and let her know. if all goes well, she's gonna start going to you for questions about the class, she'll get your number somehow, or find your email on the classlist, or perhaps find your Instagram and DM you. 

anyways, that sucks OP. I'm sorry college is like this right now. I am graduating this year, and it wasn't always like this. I'm an ENTP girl myself and I waited out my first year until I started looking for a serious relationship, even then, it took me the rest of my college experience until now to finally find my sweet and lovely INFJ bf. I was such a sad girl for three years, dropping edgy lines in class and challenging the teachers while somehow still charming them. I was waiting for some cute, romantic, INFJ boy to either back me up or call me out during class or after. it is now easier than ever with virtual communication. so keep an eye out for her"
14159,E,N,T,P,"dump him. date someone more understanding, ESTP's will always have trouble understanding ENFP, even if there is surface level attraction. Don't date a sensor, OP. You deserve someone who appreciates your spontaneity, creativity, and passion for people and world. You deserve someone who doesn't want to change you because you drink energy drinks.

It sounds like he might only like you for your looks or something, because someone who really likes you would actively try to make feel good. he's your boyfriend, HE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, not make you feel like you're a weird person."
14160,E,N,T,P,"I have been dating my INFJ for a little more than a month now. I sensed he was an INFJ as soon as I met him. the first I heard of him and the second I saw him on Instagram. I'm 21, and me and one of my guy friends and I were talking about finding each other SO's and he told me he thought I'd like the guy I'm now dating. I immediately was charmed by the captions on his Instagram (cool stuff like bugs), and followed him. my friend then invited both of us to birthday party, and we immediately hit it off. I got him to climb a tree with me at 4AM after everyone else went to sleep. then I drunkenly explained mbti to him and how I figured he was an INFJ. he took the test at 5am and that's exactly what he got!!! the next few days we couldn't stop talking, the attraction then and now still feels like none other I've felt before. not boring, he's hot and smart, just like me B) and hes super insightful and helps me out when I'm down. I just hope I can do the same for him. I never thought I'd find anyone as perfect as him, so yeah I KNOW I'm gushing and that we've only been dating for a month but this already has been longer than any of my relationships since high school."
14161,E,N,T,P,:))
14162,E,N,T,P,wtf is this!!! there's no way this is real?!!!
14163,E,N,T,P,I am also a 5w4
14164,E,N,T,P,what is just egg? is not eggs?
14165,E,N,T,P,I thought maybe you guys were just shy
14166,E,N,T,P,"woah woah woah this isn't a rude comment at all. just simply thankful for infj's! the same way you guys are thankful for us. surely there must have been an entp in your life that caused you to write this post, otherwise you wouldn't have written it. just pretend I am him"
14167,E,N,T,P,you look amazing! that difference is real!
14168,E,N,T,P,"one time I did this on the infj subreddit and nobody said a word.

so I'm gonna imagine this message is coming from my infj boyfriend <3"
14169,E,N,T,P,no you won't!!! date someone like me
14170,E,N,T,P,you could use still use premiere and incorporate DaVinci into your work flow. get sapphire from Borisfx
14171,E,N,T,P,because of the Adobe dynamic link it has with After Effects. you... do care about vfx don't you???
14172,E,N,T,P,"why did I read ""savage"" instead of agave"
14173,E,N,T,P,why is randonauting down?
14174,E,N,T,P,how do I get checked? I'm 21 and pretty sure I've had it when I struggled a lot in high school and middle school but my parents never did anything about it. what can I do now
14175,E,N,T,P,same I was also perceived as dumb in high school even though I graduated the front of my class
14176,E,N,T,P,"I FEEL LIKE YOU JUST DESCRIBED ME. seriously through and through everything that you have said just described how I have always felt. People who barely know me offend me when they say things like I should join a sorority or something ditsy idk. Or whenever I am super aimless, I have people say, ""Oh, (my name)!"" as if I'm a puppy or something who jsut had an accident. Also whenever I talk to these girls who think of me this way I am treated like an awkward middle school boy. I guess we get treated like ESFP's a lot."
14177,E,N,T,P,nice start! keep going
14178,E,N,T,P,:3
14179,E,N,T,P,i laughed so hard
14180,E,N,T,P,"yea, statistically, there are more men than women in this category. women are pushed into being more ""caring"" and ""nurturing"" and feeler through society, and are reprimanded for being T's. It is strongly discouraged. anyways, that's the story of why I had no female friends until college."
14181,E,N,T,P,yo let me be ur friend!!!! PLEASE I wanna meet infj males. I really feel like they're just as rare as us
14182,E,N,T,P,let's have an entp girl group chat!
14183,E,N,T,P,then I'd feel really alone in this world
14184,E,N,T,P,same here. i feel often misunderstood by the jokes I tell. but I don't care cuz I have dope friends. let's be friends!
14185,E,N,T,P,"that's interesting! thanks for your input. I don't think I can ever write music for a genre I don't like. now would be a good time to mention I have synesthesia and my favorite flavor of music is peppermint citrus. that usually translates to e-wave, synthpop, and electronica"
14186,E,N,T,P,actually nah I take that back. I think I'd be typed as ENTP if anyone who knows actual mbti typed me
14187,E,N,T,P,I think I'd be typed as enfp if I was famous too. what kind of music do you produce? is it conceptual and less lovey-dovey like mine?
14188,E,N,T,P,"then I would go to my spaceship where I keep my stash of nickels, as I am saving up for the OH Wow! Nickel Arcade that was suppose to have a 20 years into the future grand reopening. it's sad to think we'll never bring back Vibribbon. But I can I won't forget. This time around at least, I know who to tip my hat to"
14189,E,N,T,P,yes that's the word! thank youuuuuu so much!!
14190,E,N,T,P,I like this. I like this a lot.
14191,E,N,T,P,entp female here who dated an entp male. I acted like an entp at best while he acted like an entp at worst. need me an infj
14192,E,N,T,P,"first of all.. WHAT THE HELL

THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO.

girl you need to understand that I am coming from the EXACT same place. I dated an entp male just recently and it was amazing how we both were able to contribute to stimulating conversations and hold interesting debates. it was a turn on for both of us so we had lots of sex. he opened every door for me:,( and introduced me to his friends and family and I had a lot of fun hanging out with them both. then as time went by and a situation happened where I wasn't able to see him for two weeks, he took that time to realize that he didn't want to be with someone or have a girlfriend. your boy is EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE just like mine is D; my boy did and said the same type of stuff yours did. he told me I'm amazing and so smart after saying he didn't want to be with anyone. I told him he is emotionally unavailable and he agreed and said he wanted to try and find out why. but yeah, you should just focus on getting over him because you're too amazing to not be appreciated. I feel this way about myself and decided that I should not have hope of ever being with him even if he ever decides he's gotten over it. just leave him alone and make him think about what he's done and why. you shouldn't be with someone who wants you sometimes, he needs to want you ALL of the time. so pleaseeeee listen to me and stop wasting your time on him. there's nothing wrong with you, he's emotionally immature. I'm so sorry this happened to you because I know exactly how you're feeling. also what's crazy is this all happened to me a week and a half ago and I'm already back to normal.

just have a conversation and say that you're going to begin your process of emotional dissociation to get over him since you now know that he is emotionally unavailable :) and go find someone else because he can't just have you on the side :)

it fukcing SUCKS but I'm not letting myself waste anymore time.

please give me an update because I think it's crazy that were going through the same thing with an entp male as an entp female. must be a gLiTcH

also I feel like showing him this post and being like ""look this is exactly what you did to me"" idk I have nothing left to lose"
14193,E,N,T,P,how did you know her type? did you ask? am I not the only one who asks before the first date hahaha
14194,E,N,T,P,I hope to one day make an INFJ feel understood by me... wherever they are. your perspectives on the world are so unique and I love you<3
14195,E,N,T,P,RECIPE???
14196,E,N,T,P,"after the first year of the student subscription, it's not $20 anymore. If I remember correctly, the second year makes it $30 a month, and by the third year, it's $50 a month even though it can still be a student account. I had been using it since I was 16. Some universities like mine offer an Adobe cloud university discount that is as cheap as $20 for a year. mine does."
14197,E,N,T,P,back when I was a vegetarian I called myself an eggslut all the time
14198,E,N,T,P,"i could be super cold and distant to someone I like, and also very romantic and smothering to someone I REALLY really like. think i would be a very sweet and romantic girlfriend to someone that is worthy. I used to wish and think about meeting a guy who could just melt me. I've tried to date other guys that don't make me feel this way and it's a waste of time. I have just BARELY met someone that actually does make me feel this way so wish me luck. they are entp as well and suuuuuuper sweet. currently melting just thinking about him. I think I'm gonna text him right now"
14199,E,N,T,P,"Maybe you think the things you use are unique and special to you, and once she uses them unoriginally, it lowers their value to you. I'm not infj, I'm entp btw in my 20's, and this is really reminiscent of my elementary-high school days. in elementary school, my best friend at the time screamed and threw a tantrum at me for ""copying"" her hairstyle when I did a ponytail for the first time as she said it was ""her look."" please don't do this to someone. later in middle school, when I first became vegetarian, my best friend tried to be. when I got my lifeguard certification, my best friend wanted to as well and she wasn't even a swimmer. it didn't really bother me, I just really noticed that she wanted to be like me. shoes, makeup, clothes, it's just immature girl stuff to worry about. if you're age 18 and under, don't stress it, she just wants to be like you. you're probably really cool. relax."
14200,E,N,T,P,yessss
14201,E,N,T,P,good to know entp's can be happy together. I want to be in a relationship like this with the person I am currently seeing
14202,E,N,T,P,because I have high standards
14203,I,N,T,J,"It was something about their fates being tied closest with ours, but not necessarily the bond between them. Therefore, we can assume the Scions will continue to have a big impact on the WOL and their journey in the future. Lyse on the other hand, is going a separate way, focusing on her nation."
14204,I,N,T,J,"The real reason why if you teleport back, the guards don't lay a finger on you."

14206,I,N,T,J,"I immediately associated this with a combat setting, assuming that the person in the meme turned the toilet paper roll into some lethal cardboard shank. I thought up a scenario in which the person was trapped in their bathroom, void of all of their weaponry, and forced to used the roll as a last resort, in which they would then use to triumphantly slaughter their opposition.

Instead of... you know, realizing it was a poop scraper joke..."
14207,I,N,T,J,"Nah, you're supposed to refer to them as their current gender, rather than the one they formally were."

14210,I,N,T,J,"I took my few dollar bills, a week's worth of clothing, some canned food, a blanket, pillow, and stuffed it all in a suitcase. I put on a coat as well.

When my parents asked my what I would do to keep living, as they were likely scoffing at my sorry attempt to run away, I promptly told them that I would go from house to house and act like a homeless kid, but only the houses where I see kids playing near them beforehand, so I knew they were people with families.

I had a whole strategy, dude.

My parents brought me back home after I kept going after the end of the street."

14218,I,N,T,J,I just want to complete Castrum. ;_;
14219,I,N,T,J,"I suppose I did make it sound that way. I've never been the best at analogies, haha. I think the necessary implication is the detail that this ""beast,"" may in fact, never impact them. It's just that it might be better to prepare for it. I won't deny that I'm missing perspective as well. I would likely not have asked this question for understanding if I hadn't. Understanding which you have so kindly given me, thank you very much."
14220,I,N,T,J,"That's a good point. It really does boil down to perspective. In a metaphoric context, in some sort of Witcher-esque fantasy world, if someone hears about a terrible beast terrorizing the farms, they could either really see the impact that said beast could ravage upon the land and do something about it, or they could only see it as a distant threat, since they haven't seen the beast terrorize the land firsthand, and not do anything."
14221,I,N,T,J,You and me both. ;_;
14222,I,N,T,J,"Ouch. Hurts to think about. At least I likely don't need to worry about THAT way of death, anymore. I still have this creeping feeling that one of the twins may not live through this whole story. However, they might be fine, and grow into some sort of influential figures in an epilogue."

Our mission expands to achieve peace throughout (A PRETTY COOL PLACE) by killing some (SCARY MONSTERS). Along the way, we meet (A KIND OF BAD DUDE), and (A GOOD DUDE). Things get interesting as we are shown opposition by (SOME OTHER BAD DUDES), and come across (A VARIETY OF MORALLY QUESTIONABLE BEASTS AND CHARACTERS). It all comes to a grand climax when we go to (ANOTHER COOL PLACE), and confront (A KIND OF BAD DUDE), who tells us about (SOME IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAPPENED). In the end, this is a journey to remember."
14224,I,N,T,J,"It would be cool if there was a muscle slider for all of the races. I didn't play as a Fem Au Ra because she was dainty, but because of the tribal Xaela thing being an awesome background, and of course- scales. Of course, with the Xaela having a tribal origin, it would make sense if they were built sturdily. Oh well, haha. If they could make the body types have a tad more variety, I'd be a happy camper! ^_^"

14228,I,N,T,J,Fine by me.
14229,I,N,T,J,"It's pretty telling if most vets won't even preform the procedure anymore. I'm trying my best to have the two (bunny and kitten) get along. Kitten is very friendly, and I hope that his playfulness won't get to be too rambunctious around the bunny. Bunny is also a bit of an anxious grump. I'm going to lecture him if he gives the kitten a hard time! (Lol)"
14230,I,N,T,J,"The kitten is at least half Siberian, because his mother apparently was. They didn't know about the father."
14231,I,N,T,J,"Hm, I see. That makes me a bit worried, since my rabbit is a bit of a dum dum, and kind of tiny for a bunny (may not necessarily teach a lesson, haha) I'm considering a scenario where I try my best to have them get along, supervise them closely through this period, get claw caps for my kitten, and move the bunny's hitch into my room to keep him out of the rest of the house.

Thanks for your input!"
14232,I,N,T,J,"Hypothetically speaking, if I re-homed the kitten, I would NOT declaw him beforehand. The whole purpose of this post was really to discuss an unfortunate last resort, and any possible way to avoid it. If I felt like there was no other way, I would re-home him- simple as that. I've read about these behavioral issues, which makes sense- you're taking away a part of the cat- I would be messed up in his situation too. My brother's allergies aren't too serious, it's not like he can't breathe or anything, he just gets really stuffy and whatnot. We're hoping that with the hypoallergenic cat in this one, he'll build up an immunity.

I've read that it might take a few months for the kitty and the bunny to get comfortable with each other. I'm willing to wait. I really, really want this to work. I'm pitching these ideas to my mom- who is a very reasonable woman, so that this kitten will not turn out like that. She also cares about the well being of the cat, and is trying to figure out a way to make this all work. Your experiences are duly noted!"
14233,I,N,T,J,"Oh! That's wonderful! Thank you so much! I don't know how I've never heard of these before, after looking up so many solutions for this problem. You are a godsend."
14234,I,N,T,J,"Thank you, I absolutely love cats, and have wanted to befriend one for so long. I'm going to try my best to convince my mom to just work with integrating the bunny and kitten together, and we're going to try our best to be good companions to this animal, that will always be in its best interests.

I never heard of the bottle feeding tidbit. Interesting. :)"
14235,I,N,T,J,"That's what I'm trying to do. Some have suggested the kitten should be re-homed, which I have already been taking into consideration. I've been keeping a close eye on them whenever they're around each other. I might move my bunny into my bedroom- that's a good suggestion."
14236,I,N,T,J,"You're likely right, and I've proposed the idea. I'm trying to integrate the bunny and kitten, hoping that keeping the kitten's nails diligently trimmed and exposing him to the bunny from a young age will allow them to get along, as I've heard of from other sites, and some personal testimonies written on this post. I understand it might be a little selfish, but I promise you I don't take the lives of fellow animals lightly. I will do whatever is in my power to allow this cat and rabbit to live in a loving, healthy environment."
14237,I,N,T,J,"I'm currently trying to integrate the two by having them look at each other. I watch them very closely. So far, bunny is territorial, (as most things I've researched have suggested he would react), and kitten skitters away when he thumps. The kitten is very friendly, so I'm hoping that will help."
14238,I,N,T,J,"I've thought about that, and agree with your statement. It would be like cutting off the finger after the knuckle, and being told to live with it. Crazy! I'm just being selfish, I suppose. I'm talking with my mom about it, and awaiting a response over the proposal of bringing the kitten back. I'm heartbroken, but perhaps he'll be happier elsewhere."
14239,I,N,T,J,"If I had not cared at all for the well-being of an animal, I wouldn't be turning this question over and over in my head and stressing over it. I do think it's inhumane, and wouldn't be able to bring myself to look my friend in the eyes after such a thing. That's why I came here to ask for advice to allow my cat and bunny to get along and be safe. However, I said that I understand if you think I'm awful for even considering such I thing, so I'll take it. I've just had some bad experiences with other people's pets getting loose and killing mine."
14240,I,N,T,J,"I'm aware of how bunnies can defend themselves. This bunny is a Lionhead Dwarf, making him a bit smaller than most, I should mention. I should have mentioned how I was worried that I am concerned over my bunny potentially harming the kitten too. Do you have any advice on how I can get them accustomed to each other's presence without hurting each other, based off of your experience?"
14241,I,N,T,J,This made me laugh much more than it should have.
14242,I,N,T,J,"If you don't mind, could you explain what that means?"
14243,I,N,T,J,"Agreed. I don't see why they couldn't for the main scenario ones, maybe not the permanent avatars."
14244,I,N,T,J,"I hope we eventually get a massive graphics update what with the PS5 coming out. I'm sure there's more to this, but I'm not a tech guy, so I likely won't comprehend protests against me for making that statement. I'd love to try to understand, though."

14269,E,N,F,P,"2w3 here!! I recommend that you be straightforward and honest with your feelings. Don’t sugar coat anything. If she’s being controlling and possessive, you should tell her to knock it off while she’s doing it. I would rather be called out in the act then to go unaware and let it build up and then be confronted with things I probably forgot about all the sudden. She may be different, but that’s how I’d like to be told.

And I do feel wrong about about my neediness and all that jazz. I usually keep it under control, but I still feel guilty knowing it’s there. Anyways, I do hope your friend handles everything well. Some twos are a little out there to say the least, but some are good people. Your friend seems like a good person and I do believe if she puts in the effort she can slow down on the possessiveness and controlling behavior. I hope everything goes well and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day or night. Good luck!!"

14278,E,N,F,P,"THAT IS EXACTLY HOW MY CLASSMATES ARE. It’s just “Did you finish the work” followed by some obvious lie about them being unable to do it. And when I don’t respond within the first 2 minutes they spam me FaceTime calls until I pick up. Thank god today is my last day, but knowing them they’d spam me for the answers on my summer work too."
14279,E,N,F,P,"Awh, I’m sorry to hear about that. You don’t deserve to be with those people"
14280,E,N,F,P,I think so
14281,E,N,F,P,It hit me like a bus during quarantine lmao. The majority of the people that have remained in contact with me that aren’t my closest friends only message me for homework answers.
14282,E,N,F,P,I sent you a friend request
14283,E,N,F,P,sure! What’s your discord tag?

14341,I,N,F,P,My step moms cat follows her around all day and meows like crazy when she leaves. No one could deny how much that cat loves her
14342,I,N,F,P,I cant be bothered to watch the show but I still really enjoy the podcast! They sum up the episodes and whatnot but you dont really need to know the plot anyways.
14343,I,N,F,P,I have never seen a second of the West Wing but I LOVE listening to people tear media apart so i love the West Wing Thing podcast. It's also very informative from a political standpoint
14344,I,N,F,P,I thought the fingers thing was from anime/ cartoons
14345,I,N,F,P,They probably wanted to play a solo?
14346,I,N,F,P,No but you can strong arm into making someone agree to it

14349,I,N,F,P,"And it's not even just teenage girls, there are a lot of fans like me in their 20s because BTS has been around for like 7 years even though they only started to get popular in NA in the last couple of years. It's just frustrating when the fans are degraded because most of the fan I've met online and off have been amazing."
14350,I,N,F,P,"I've never really understood the appeal of beards but other women seem to really like them. Maybe it's an age thing, I'm in my early 20s."
14351,I,N,F,P,I just failed my NCLEX so this is giving me hope. Thank you
14352,I,N,F,P,To recap: you said you dont like that they look like women and that you go yelled at for saying that. I said that was ignorant. You said you dont like the music or the music video. I'm saying that's fine just dont be ignorant.
14353,I,N,F,P,Did you even read my reply lol I specifically said I wasnt saying you did that
14354,I,N,F,P,"I'm not saying you have to like them or the music but you have to understand how it comes across when you say a group of asian men look like women. I literally dont care if you don't like the music or video but saying you dont like it and calling it trash are different (not saying you specifically said it trash, just as an example). 

All the fans ask for is to not be shit on by people making fun of yet another thing girls like. We cant enjoy anything ffs."
14355,I,N,F,P,Yeah the fans are toxic while you guys are out here calling a group of guys trash ok yeah noted
14356,I,N,F,P,Bts fanbase is actually very diverse and more around ages 18-20
14357,I,N,F,P,They are not. Dont spout some bullshit that you dont even know about. They literally write their own music
14358,I,N,F,P,People call something you're passionate about trash and insult people that we admire and then act shocked when we get mad. And on a fortnite sub of all things. Hypocrites
14359,I,N,F,P,Probably because that's an ignorant thing to say lmao
14360,I,N,F,P,I get this is just a joke but I'm sick and tired of this kind of thing. Can girls enjoy anything without being made fun of?
14361,I,N,F,P,Nah we get pissed when people put us down for liking them or insult the group. People dont have to like them all we ask for is decency.
14362,I,N,F,P,I only did it once and as soon as I realized it woke me up
14363,I,N,F,P,When he first joined I 100% got the vibe that he is bisexual

14369,I,N,F,P,Anything by Skott!
14370,I,N,F,P,I got a notification that I failed so I have a tiny hope that theres been a mistake. I know that's not very likely I just thought the way I got my results is odd.
14371,I,N,F,P,I dont know what to do. I didnt think CNO could even send out results so fast.
14372,I,N,F,P,See I found my questions hard but idk if they were actually hard or if i'm just dumb lol. Still havent tried the trick I'm afraid of getting a bad popup
14373,I,N,F,P,No I definately though they meant the animal
14374,I,N,F,P,Yes I feel like the questions were trying to trick me. There was always more than one answer that seemed correct
14375,I,N,F,P,Also I'm too scared to do the Pearson VUE trick
14376,I,N,F,P,Omg I just took my test and this is making me feel way better because I hardly had any SATA even though I did 120 questions. Maybe I do have a chance lol
14377,I,N,F,P,This is making me feel better because I test tomorrow and I've only been studying about 1h per day on average for about 6 weeks. I'm glad to hear it's less content heavy because I'm so bad at memorization
14378,I,N,F,P,"Decided on a style that I liked and started building my wardrobe from scratch instead of just buying cheap generic stuff like I was before.

Learned how to care for my curly hair properly, although I'm still working on it.

Learned how to do makeup.

14379,I,N,F,P,Thank you this sub is so quick to assume people are evil or crazy. Especially women/girls.
14380,I,N,F,P,Thank you why are people always so willing to bash a CHILD when we dont even have her side of the story. She probably feels left out.

14384,I,N,F,P,Yeah they're fairly popular
14385,I,N,F,P,No lol it just stays open. It's a small hole so it dosent cause any problems

14389,E,N,F,P,"Painting a car is a huge pain in the ass and rarely goes well - it’s also extremely expensive to do properly.

Get it wrapped if you want to change it, pay the extra and travel to go to a pro - if done well it’ll actually protect the red coat underneath and you’ll have fresh paint on if you ever resell which well help retain your value in the car tremendously"
14390,E,N,F,P,"Older generation - and people in the south/
Midwest say it pretty frequently. I’m in a very secular/non-religious state and area but I hear it often enough in a ma’and pa shop or as an expression to say “thank you.”"
14391,E,N,F,P,Those words fit my life so perfectly. I feel on that. I’m actually glad to hear I’m not alone in such an odd feeling. I can kinda manage living with her in the mean time but I absolutely don’t want her near me or my future wife+kids
14392,E,N,F,P,Back lips are the coolest slides - you can’t change my mind
14393,E,N,F,P,La La Land
14394,E,N,F,P,Yeah he’s right. Been a professional trainer for a long time and people who are severely overweight are almost always using their food addiction to cope with underlying trauma. It’s a mind/spirit change that has to happen before they can even begin to be concerned about their bodies.

14398,E,N,F,P,He can’t - every use of the time stone creates a new reality - of which wizards like Strange occupy all at once - he just creates suffering for himself by doing so. He has to maintain enlightenment/righteousness/peace in as many realms as possible. I read an explanation about it once.
14399,E,N,F,P,"Watch Elon’s interview on Joe Rogan about it - he says it can make blind people see, deaf people hear, the paralyzed walk, stop seizures, communicate telepathically etc.

14405,E,N,F,P,"That’s insane. You’ll never see 1 MM in your lifetime. The algorithm is set to mine it’s last coin in the year 2140, over 100 years. And only 21 million will be out there. If every coin is worth a million then that’s $210,000,000,000,000 worth of coin on the market. That’s almost three times more than the entire value of all currency ON THE ENTIRE PLANET. 
So, no. You’ll never see it for 1 MM per btc.

Edit: words.

P.S. anyone that says they know EXACTLY where btc will be even 1 year from now is lying to you. It’s all speculative. IMO if you’re a kid now, you MIGHT see btc close to six digits if you have a lengthy life but that’s about it."
14406,E,N,F,P,"I’ve been living with my parents on and off since 16 - I’m 23 now and about to go university so hopefully for good this time. 

If you’re asking culturally, I’d say it’s pretty common to have your parents kick you out at around 18. I feel within the past decade or so kids have hung around a bit longer mostly due to economic conditions and expensive tuitions. IMO anything past 25 is pushing it."
14407,E,N,F,P,"I’m from California - many cities on the coast are the most peaceful, beautiful cities I’ve seen in any state. Big Sur, Morrow Bay, Santa Barbara and some of the most progressive, artsy and affluent cities as well - Especially in the Carmel area"

14413,E,N,F,P,"this shows very low level jiu jitsu skills. Looks to me like he’s a blue belt who just learned what heel hooks are.
There’s a reason this move is only taught to you after your first year and even then some professors won’t let you throw a heel hook on anyone significantly beneath your belt level.
This move has catastrophic consequences and in a street fight your opponent won’t know how to position their weight to reduce leverage or even what’s happening to them.
Their both lucky nothing significant happened and that guy should be wrung out by his coach."

The Bible.

The parables and story of a man named Christ, (whatever he means to you, real or fiction)- speaks deeply to what it means to be human and the struggles and triumphs of the human condition.

14431,E,N,F,P,"Depends on when you’re retiring.

Think about it like this-
The fed is propping the market up because they’re protecting the massive Boomer demographic who will be retiring soon - not to mention almost all of the elites and politicians of the US fit this demographic as well.
As soon as the boomers sell of and cash out, the millennials are going to feels the real pain of the quantitive easing - 

BUT if you’re young and have say 30+ years until retirement and you’ve got skin in the game, KEEP IT IN. Infact, a market correction will be a good time to buy quality companies at a fair price rather than this overvalued B.S. we currently have.

Oh and also, don’t listen to strangers on the internet. Make sure you do you own research and know what to look for - 

Like Buffet said - [paraphrasing here] 
balance sheet and earnings reports are the languages of business, if you cant speak it, you have no business in the market."

That and people being real high and mighty about their opinions. It’s ok to nicely nudge someone if they’re making some blatantly poor financial decisions - but other than that, zip it.

14469,I,N,F,J,Fucking ninjas cutting onions i swear

14473,I,N,F,J,"Holy fuck, glad everybody’s ok!!! What type of car hit you?? 😳😳"
14474,I,N,F,J,Welcome to the dark side. Great meme
14475,I,N,F,J,"I only tried that once. Also, beautiful chonk"
14476,I,N,F,J,I honestly didn’t even notice this until about 3 years ago

14478,I,N,F,J,"Me too - I am honestly surprised so many of us are like this, since this is one of many reasons I thought I was an INFP. Then I’ve learned about functions..."

Try to search in some facebook groups with expat women in czechia, they will probably know the best. You will have to pay for it 100% (i believe it can cost up to 10k czk, but I have luckily never had to get one so I am not sure and it can be different for a foreigner). If you don’t feel comfortable asking on facebook, just try some english speaking clinics or gynecologists that you find on google and try to call them and ask. Pretty sure there has to be a way. Also - if you have an insurance (not czech one but even travel insurance) just contact the company you got it from, they should be able to help you as well. Wish you luck! 🤞🏻"

14489,I,N,T,P,"Gotcha. I am for department of education part though.

I’m just voting for her because I live in a one party state (so my vote doesn’t matter) and third parties can get funding if enough percent vote. Might ever so slightly shake the status quo."

14491,I,N,T,P,"Yeah, we should only have one party and eliminate all other parties and opinions that we don’t like. That would be cool right guys."

You eat, it goes up, but will plateau soon after, regardless of how much food. That makes you hungry.

14512,I,N,T,P,"Not to ruin the meme, but if you did minimal cognitive function research, you’d know INTJs are probably the most emotional IXTXs. They have an internal feeling function as their tertiary. 

Least emotional is likely ISTP or ENTJ. Then INTP and ESTJ. *Then* INTJ and ISTJ. 

IXTP and EXTJs have inferior feeling functions for a reason."
14513,I,N,T,P,I never understood why some people think 13 year olds can’t determine that for themselves. I’ve been sexually actively since 9. I think I’d know by then.
14514,I,N,T,P,And the “women” responding are either 50 year old men or look like this https://mobile.twitter.com/melissablake/status/1170481393673166849/photo/1
14515,I,N,T,P,My grandma has that. Nostalgia bomb
14516,I,N,T,P,I was diagnosed and checked Reddit. Nothing interesting
14517,I,N,T,P,"Logically, the types for that correlate with schizoid the most would be:

•ISTP
•INTP

This is due to inferior Fe. The function in the inferior position makes the user struggle at social interaction, relationships, emotional expression, properly accommodating for others, empathy, love, and connection on a familial level. Sounds pretty schizoid to me, especially considering IXTPs are thinking function dominant. 

A lot of people would presumptively say “INTJ”, because of all the stereotypes surrounding the type like “INTJ=cold emotionless mastermind 400+IQ unlovable etc” but those are all quite untrue. INTJs are probably only the 5th least emotional of the 16 types due to them having tertiary Fi. Due to the Fi, they are actually decently emotionally driven and due to their auxiliary Te, they’re also quite sociable/commanding. 

So, INTJ simply correlates less to schizoid traits than ISTP and INTP.


Enneagram wise, (this is an easy one as the resemblance is immense):

•5

•and to a lesser degree, 9"

14539,E,N,F,P,"Well even if it's not dead there, I can say with confidence that in many places, it's not a big issue.

But at any rate, the point I was trying to make is that if you wanted to know how many people think that men & women are generally equal as human beings, and/or should be treated equally, it would've been better to ask *that*. By asking about feminism, there's a good chance you're catching a lot of people saying no to feminism that actually do think we're equals but they dislike the feminist movement for other reasons."
14540,E,N,F,P,"Doesn't matter, we're still talking like 50-60 million between the 2 of them, plus, as I said, I think what I said is true for most of the Western world. Including the US, I might add. You'll always find jerks anywhere, & no society or group will be perfect. but personally, I'm in my mid-30s, & I've only *once* been told I couldn't do a job *because* I'm a woman (& that came from another woman), & most people I've interacted have treated me as an individual & haven't pre-judged me based on my sex. I just don't see it as being a big issue at the moment. 

If anything I'd say modern feminine is *contributing* to sexism by treating women as a monolith, united in some pretty contentious ideas & behaviours, & it's causing a knee-jerk reaction in some people where they dig in their heels & go too far the other direction in response (which is a dynamic I think you see a lot of these days in general, tbh)."
14541,E,N,F,P,"Oh is that so? I haven't seen any polls or anything on it. I'm just going by the people I know IRL & like-minded people online.

14553,E,N,F,P,"Maybe more like street performers than beggars, though."
14554,E,N,F,P,"Tiny? 😛 They're hardly tiny lol. But I think it's fine in most of the Western world, at least. And even though there are countries or areas that still need work, it's still the case that modern Western feminism is associated with a lot of things *besides* seeing women as equal, capable individuals, and lots of people disagree enough with those things that they wouldn't call themselves feminists. I'd say that's true for at least half the people I know, men and women both."
14555,E,N,F,P,"Well, coming from Canada & living in Australia, I'd say yes. It's been rare that I ever felt someone thought less of me for being a woman... And the only overt sexism I've experienced came from another woman 😛"
14556,E,N,F,P,"I think if you were wondering about equality for women, then you asked the wrong question 😛 these days, ""feminism"" is associated with a lot of stuff besides just that. Heck, I'm a woman and think women are equal to men, but I'm not a feminist."

14560,E,N,F,P,"My style is a bit eclectic, but I think my essentials would be

* a kind of edgy-looking leather jacket (you know, the kind with cool little details like zippers, ribbing, studs, etc),
* flared jeans (I hope bell-bottoms come back soon lol),
* some kind of higher boot with relatively flat soles (knee-highs, mid-calf Manitobah Mukluks, or ankle-high boots)
* shirts and leggings that are fitted but comfortable and have nice colours and/or designs on them,
* leggings + shorts combo (especially patterned leggings but I have my standard black ones, and I love capri-length ones especially)
* necklaces (they're my go-to jewelry choice) - I love choker-length ones, and hang various pendants on them. I like a lot of nature-themed pendants, like right now I'm wearing a black fossil Megalodon tooth pendant, & some of my other faves are shaped like leaves, fox skulls, frogs, & one made out of mammoth tusk (in the shape of a smaller tusk, lol)."

14564,E,N,F,P,"It really is a detriment. I'm originally from Canada and had to leave the subs for Canada, my home province, *and* my home town, because they were all super political and usually really vitriolic. I was particularly surprised about my province and hometown since I'm from one of the more conservative parts of the country but the subs are full of some *really* far-left people. I just wanted to see pics of my home province and see what people are doing there, not talk about politics all the time 😅 I'm so glad this subreddit is better for that."
14565,E,N,F,P,"I don't know how fancy it is, but I really enjoyed Kiama. It's such a cute town 🙂"
14566,E,N,F,P,"Yeah I've always been childlike and made friends easily with people younger than me. Lately I haven't been feeling that way as much, and it feels outright weird to me."
14567,E,N,F,P,"I find I do that a lot with Facebook, actually. Less so on Reddit, but sometimes yeah."
14568,E,N,F,P,"Lol, I don't see why not. As long as you're not going nuts on caffeine or sugar, you'll be fine. (Though I do know some people where more than 1 coffee and 1 black tea in a day is too much caffeine! It doesn't take much haha.)"
14569,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, all the time."

14573,E,N,F,P,"I'm not even athletic & I think it'd bug me eventually 😅 like it's one thing to be honest/practical, but too often & it'd feel like he's rubbing it in your face."
14574,E,N,F,P,"I think the things people experience are often real, but not that they're the spirits of dead people."
14575,E,N,F,P,"Half as often is tempting, but I get bad symptoms so I think always getting it at the worst time would seriously screw things up, possibly more than it's worth .."
14576,E,N,F,P,"I like geology a lot better, but you'd probably wanna check about what kind of job prospects you could expect. I'm sure they'd each lead to rather different lifestyles, too."
14577,E,N,F,P,I really think it's best to apply ideas from all of them in whatever ways that are most useful. A mix is better than sticking predominantly with any one of them.
14578,E,N,F,P,"To a point, at least. It's harder to be happy if you're like, on the street or just scraping by or something."
14579,E,N,F,P,"Aw thanks man, I appreciate it!"
14580,E,N,F,P,"I know they're all real, so I answered thinking of which one sounds most like a fake country from a movie or something, lol."
14581,E,N,F,P,"I feel like, I could hold a little space for you feeling like it resolves something inside you... But at the same time, maybe it'd be a good idea to examine that a bit closer and see what's going on there. Like thinking of it as a personal growth springboard. 

(I'll be honest, I don't think it's normal (not meaning to sound aggressive with that, just don't know how else to say it) but at the same time we all have stuff to work out lol.)"
14582,E,N,F,P,"Nah, any human experiments should be voluntary and done as ethically as possible."
14583,E,N,F,P,"I was thinking how sad it is that people put political affiliation ahead of things like religion and what that says about society, haha. But if you view it as more like, the morals that underpin all your views, that'd make more sense. I hope a lot of people had that in mind if they answered politics, and not a political party 😅"
14584,E,N,F,P,The airplane toilet flushing always startles me. I really dislike it 😅
14585,E,N,F,P,Yeah me too.
14586,E,N,F,P,"I'm in the middle of a rough one that (TMI warning) backed me up for *two weeks* to the point where I had to see a doctor; it made me feel all demotivated for a week and like pure garbage for 3 days before... Then I'm all cramping and sick and crying over everything and even had a little mild depersonalization... Not fun.

Fun fact though, ibuprofen and acetaminophen have really different effects on me with regards to managing it. I think maybe there's inflammation causing more than just pain for me, cos I spent all of yesterday grumping about on the couch and feeling like crap (taking panadol) and today I tried an ibuprofen and was basically able to go to the mall for a while (although I had to take it slow and chill). My mood is much better after the ibuprofen too. Food for thought."
14587,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, I do think that abortion is wrong in all circumstances. I thought I made that pretty clear before, but I guess not, so yes, I do think that. Murder is murder. That goes for any situation.

You kind of did imply that abortion is the most logical thing for a rape survivor to do, though. 

I also know that it happens in places where it's illegal. I can't speak for every place but it seems to me that when it's illegal, it's still usually done by doctors, the same ones that do it once it becomes legal. It's just all on the down-low. And certainly having it be legal doesn't substantially change the risks involved or the morality of the matter.

Okay then, so if a fetus in a very early developmental stage isn't human, then what is it? It's genetically human, it's distinct from the mother, if you drink or do drugs it will affect the human that it would eventually ""become"" for the rest of its life. Why should we make the cutoff point viability? And taking that logic elsewhere, if a born human becomes unable to sustain itself, should we no longer consider it human, or a person? Does it become more okay to kill it? I just gotta say that I take great issue with defining humanity by ""viability"" and the ability for one to sustain itself. Heck, even a born child wouldn't meet that criteria if you think about it.

I'm not American either but it's something that's talked about in every country. Like, you asked what country would allow an abortion 7-8 months into a pregnancy? Canada does, and so does New Zealand. I think a few places in Australia might too. To my knowledge, some US states allow it. That's just off the top of my head. It doesn't matter much to me if I'm from a place or not, but I just don't see any good justification for dehumanizing very young babies and that has *huge* moral and social ramifications. Not just for abortion either, cos the same lines of reasoning ultimately apply to matters like euthanasia and caring for the disabled and ill. It's not the kind of thing we should be skirting around and not wanting to engage in."
14588,E,N,F,P,"You're right that social gender norms are always up for renegotiation, and that's fine. But being *male* or *female* is not negotiable like that. When you say you're a mother or father, that's not just tied to social norms, it's tied to biological sex. 

If you're biologically a man, you could be a father. You can't be a mother. Dressing up as a woman in the evenings doesn't make you female in the evening. Switching how you dress won't make you a mother *and* father. Plus, there's a lot of overlap in how men & women behave - a father doesn't become a mother as soon as he starts doing more stereotypically motherly things (like comforting a crying kid or cooking dinner). It doesn't change his sex, it doesn't even change his gender - if gender is basically the social performance of your sex, and everyone performs a little different, that'd just be being a normal person, especially when it comes to doing the kinds of things that most normal human beings do with a normal variation in how good or natural we are at them (like cooking, parenting a child, being talkative or emotional or stoic or analytical or whatever other trait a person can have).

Honestly I feel like this type of ideology is so weird. It really *requires* super strict social norms for gender that most people don't really adhere to these days (after decades of renegotiation, I might add) and then says you can just change your gender willy nilly, even down to terms tied to *sex*. It basically asks us to cement sex-associated personality and social traits, to pin them down hard. Sorry, but I just don't think human beings actually work that way."
14589,I,N,T,P,I guess Reddit is down to the level of YouTube comments them.
14590,I,N,T,P,"Damn, you really nailed the fisheye lens look"
14591,I,N,T,P,Yea this is the way I'd probably do it if I were to kill myself. Quick easy and painless
14592,I,N,T,P,Tbf 99% of he's fans can't even vote
14593,I,N,T,P,Thanks for the clarification!
14594,I,N,T,P,Does thinking femboys are cute make someone bi? An honest question?
14595,I,N,T,P,It killed his eardrums allright
14596,I,N,T,P,echo looks like rei aswell
14597,I,N,T,P,I thought this was a recording from a vr game for a second
14598,I,N,T,P,My dear this is what we call satire
14599,I,N,T,P,This is the broadest starter pack I've seen in a while.
14600,I,N,T,P,RHANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION BROTHER/SISTER! GUESS YOU LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERYDAY!
14601,I,N,T,P,"IF IM NOT MISTAKEN THAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SUB, ITS COUNTERPART BEING A DOM, BUT FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG MF'FER"
14602,I,N,T,P,Can I have some cold war please
14603,I,N,T,P,Insert *at least his legs won't hurt* joke here
14604,I,N,T,P,Mayonnaise
14605,I,N,T,P,Wouldn't really mind just having a coffee every morning
14606,I,N,T,P,"Wow, did you make this? That looks amazingly good. The colours are great for a watercolour."
14607,I,N,T,P,Friendship ended with my homie. Now my homie is my best friend
14608,I,N,T,P,I was expecting still Dre at the end
14609,I,N,T,P,Could maybe use a bit more contrast but look great like this too
14610,I,N,T,P,If someone likes this they should check out King Gizzard and the wizard lizard's flying microtonal banana. A bit like this but with lyrics and sounds better
14611,I,N,T,P,If he doesnt need validation why did he tweet it?
14612,I,N,T,P,"Car ad starter pack:
Car"
14613,I,N,T,P,"Mobile is more handy but it still somehow doesn't work that great. Videos don't load, some don't have sound. Also polls sometimes don't work and some post take 20 seconds to open with 4g network. 
      Reddit usually is the best thing for mobile but good videogames beat Reddit anyday if I already have access to my home PC."
14614,I,N,T,P,Call me virgin.
14615,I,N,T,P,Feet have superior range
14616,I,N,T,P,A fellow feet enhusiast I see!
14617,I,N,T,P,WYM you can't use it? Now is a perfect time to use it
14618,I,N,T,P,Seks penis's????
14619,I,N,T,P,That's the worst phone hand writing I've seen
14620,I,N,T,P,Kinda looks like Merlyn woods if you've ever heard of him
14621,I,N,T,P,The fuck? My tumour can have teeth but I can't if I lose one?
14622,I,N,T,P,That Oreo looks suspicious
14623,I,N,T,P,What are the rats gonna do to deathwing tho?
14624,I,N,T,P,Deathwing is 12/12 minion and rats are 1/1 minions so you only need 12 rats. Rats win ez
14625,I,N,T,P,Guess I can't read
14626,I,N,T,P,Bet they were just stalking your profile and went to your comment from there
14627,I,N,T,P,Someone else will
14628,I,N,T,P,Yea but some other asshole can just make a poll that ask what ancient torture device should we use on u/ksiolajidebthd
14629,I,N,T,P,English teachers be like
14630,I,N,T,P,Ramiel do be looking hella seductive😩
14631,I,N,T,P,"Damn, this is hella cute"
14632,I,N,T,P,I feel like this might have been in a movies ending or at least it just fits so well I'm imagining it being
14633,I,N,T,P,I'd watch that movie
14634,I,N,T,P,That's a good one. It would sound super familiar but might not be obvious what it is at the beginning.
14635,I,N,T,P,"No, and not going to. I feel like automatic suicide prevention services wouldn't be very efficient."
14636,I,N,T,P,"Idk seems too self aware. Might still help kill the format because meta memes are kind of the last step for memes before death, but this still might not be bad enough"
14637,I,N,T,P,Bullets are weird. Some videos they explode the whole head others they make a small hole with not much blood. Guess caliber and velocity make a big difference.
14638,I,N,T,P,Not really. All the shit about seeing married adults who don't love each other doesn't seem for me. I'd rather just break up when I don't love someone anymore.
14639,I,S,F,P,Woo
14640,I,S,F,P,This is why I stick to that cupcake collage site and yahoo answers 2.0
14641,I,S,F,P,What did they change? I've never played the original P4
14642,I,S,F,P,"I believed the first one for a sec, ngl"
14643,I,S,F,P,I'm a centrist and I would travel to like 2005
14644,I,S,F,P,something about rule 2
14645,I,S,F,P,Baste and grill-pilled
14646,I,S,F,P,It's actually sort of terrifying how so many people have whatever opinions are popular on social media. Pineapple pizza is great. Mint chip ice cream is great. Why don't people just try things for themselves?
14647,I,S,F,P,...it's a test result
14648,I,S,F,P,Why not both?
14649,I,S,F,P,Did they ever get back to you?
14650,I,S,F,P,We should all be more like Daryl Davis
14651,I,S,F,P,This sounds like something I would say
14652,I,S,F,P,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm often in the same situation where I say something to a friend or in a group chat and they never reply, or that they only talk to me when I talk to them. That especially happens with my female friends; it's hard for me to connect with other girls.

&nbsp;

I definitely understand the relationship thing. There are some benefits to being a woman for sure. I just hate when people think we all have it super easy all the time."
14653,I,S,F,P,"In the past when there were wars over religion yes, in current times probably not"
14654,I,S,F,P,But being insecure about your appearance isn't really the same as being depressed. Plus that only happens to popular girls. I hate the stereotype that every woman has tons of simps and gets showered with compliments constantly.
14655,I,S,F,P,I know this is true but I've never understood that concept. How are the chances not 10% every time?
14656,I,S,F,P,Babyyy
14657,I,S,F,P,If the bottom two were swapped this would be a political compass
14658,I,S,F,P,Aw tysm. This is one of the most wholesome threads I've ever seen and I especially love to see guys complimenting each other because we need more of that. *hug*
14659,I,S,F,P,"I'm a girl but I could still use a compliment. I'm 24, I mainly keep to myself and just hang out with my boyfriend, I don't have many friends and all of them are guys. I love animals and gaming. I'm very self-conscious but at least I'm aware of it. I got a decent job recently which is a huge confidence boost though. Also I like to compliment others whenever I can :)"
14660,I,S,F,P,Right thumb gang
14661,I,S,F,P,Funny meme but the tweet is satire
14662,I,S,F,P,I am all of these reactions simultaneously
14663,I,S,F,P,I agree but why did you downvote?
14664,I,S,F,P,"I've gotten reiki treatments before. I don't know anything about the physical benefits but it's very calming, and I can only describe it as feeling like a warm energy wave. It's definitely a real thing."
14665,I,S,F,P,How are people getting free awards?
14666,I,S,F,P,Librights are objectively the funniest quadrant. I don't make the rules
14667,I,S,F,P,"Wore a tail everyday and talked about how she thought some animals were ""sexy."" She got a job at a pet store a few years later which was a little concerning.

&nbsp;

On the bright side, I got her to tell me my spirit animal. Apparently I'm a honey badger."
14668,I,S,F,P,"She's a monarchist, so yes"
14669,I,S,F,P,She also tweeted that she would prefer monarchy over democracy so it's pretty much confirmed
14670,I,S,F,P,"Just so everyone knows, this is a satire account"
14671,I,S,F,P,"I either love it or hate it depending on the song. I love country music that either sounds powerful (ie. Before He Cheats) or deep and reminiscent (ie. Whiskey Lullaby). I dislike country songs that sound too ""sweet."" Something really bothers me about artists like Lady A, Tori Kelly, and Kelsea Ballerini but I don't know exactly what."
14672,I,S,F,P,"Mean people. Especially when people think that being mean and bullying others makes them strong or empowered. If you're strong, you don't need to tear others down."
14673,I,S,F,P,I'm a bi woman and I didn't watch that shit either. I don't like being pandered to.
14674,I,S,F,P,Whale? She's not even that big
14675,I,S,F,P,Tbf coffee is much healthier than energy drinks. It's not good to have too much though
14676,I,S,F,P,It's okay for someone to have different opinions than you
14677,I,S,F,P,"I still need to watch it, I was asleep during the debate"
14678,I,S,F,P,"Out of these options, Bernie or maybe Jo Jorgensen. Ideally, Yang or Tulsi. Both of them have the ability to unite democrats, republicans, and moderates."
14679,I,S,F,P,I can't wrap my head around the fact that some people on here were 7 when clash of clans came out
14680,I,S,F,P,"For me it's a tie between Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. But if I had to only choose 1 I would go with Japanese because it's the healthiest."
14681,I,S,F,P,"Yes

&nbsp;

Also if you're having trouble paying attention, I recommend going to bed a little earlier. I could never pay attention in high school and years later I realized it was because I was always sleep deprived"
14682,I,S,F,P,Idk man you're kinda sus
14683,I,S,F,P,White with the cherry or flower hat. I've been using the spooky pumpkin hat lately though
14684,I,S,F,P,"Lauren Southern, is that you?"
14685,I,S,F,P,I got a job today too! Congrats :D
14686,I,S,F,P,For a second I thought this was r/politicalcompassmemes
14687,I,S,F,P,Isn't that called absurdist humor or something? I love it
14688,I,S,F,P,Following
14689,I,N,T,P,"Agree. I saw for the first time a girl that was going to be my roommate. I didn't know she was gonna be my roommate but when I saw her, I instantly didn't like her. She had a bad bitch face. Guess what, we shared room and she did some shitty things to me after all... 
After some time I realized that probably I can read people better than I think and before I was thinking, you can't judge people by their appearance. But now, I think I can read people, I usually know what people I'm gonna get along with, and I follow my intuition better now."
14690,I,N,T,P,I think a realistic INTP would never achieve to be a scientist because it's too much work and effort. Maybe INTP-A. But definitely not an INTP-T. I'm an INTP-T. I've been good at science and I loved technology. I don't know why I ended up doing communications degree and my brain is too logical to do that. And now I'm fucked up. So I'm lost in life lol
14691,I,N,T,P,"I think it doesn't work like that. In Europe housing is really expensive. It doesn't matter if it's a shitty city, the house prices are really expensive... You can't save money because you spend every penny on expenses, taxes, food, transportation (which can be really expensive too)... So basically you can't safe money but you still live in a shitty city."
14692,I,N,T,P,"I don't know. Usually the people that most get me and understand me are Scorpios, maybe because of my 3rd house in Scorpio and stellium in 8th house... 
I feel like they understand my depth and I understand their depth. It depends on the Scorpio but If they're advanced and not toxic, they're amazing. I also drawn in my emotions... I feel like they invade me and I need time to rest to deal with my emotions. I also need alone time and even feel like I'm hiding somewhere so that I feel safe... 
I've met many fire signs and they're usually pretty much positive... Like, when I get sad I literally fall from where I am and I become depressed and I enter into the darkness, into hell... Then I need some time to come out lol. But I feel like fire and air signs don't have this. They recover easily and they feel less pain because they're not sensitive. For example, I feel like aquarius or Leos or sags are not sensitive at all... I'm hypersensitive... a sensitive person can't be rough with their words or can't get along with everyone... And Leos and air signs or sags usually get along with everyone."
14693,I,N,T,P,"I feel like people complain so much about shit I don't find that sad. I went through a lot of shit and I only empathize with things I went through... I can't empathize with you complaining about your boyfriend, or about romantic stuff. I freaking hate it. They're lucky to even have a romantic partner so I can't empathize with them lol... There are many energetical vampires. So I don't let people complain with me nor tell me their problems. I'm too good for them, I don't fake my emotions, but they do. They can talk for 4 hours and complain and cry and shit and you give them all your energy and then they feel great and you feel tired and empty. I don't give my shoulder easily like that. I'm not no one's therapist. If people have problems I always advise them to go to a therapist. I don't want to be their shoulder to cry on..."
14694,I,N,T,P,"I don't know if you know MBTI but I'm an INTP, Aries sun Virgo rising Libra moon, aries mercury. I'm intuitive. But I'm not a feeler. I don't like dealing with people's emotions, though I'm really empathetic so I don't know how to explain that. I just don't empathize with some people because I find them fake. But I'm much more deeper than other fire or air signs I know. Maybe it's because I have stellium in 8th house. I don't get along with superficial people like some Leos, sags, libras, etc."
14695,I,N,T,P,I'm a really sensitive aries. I have Libra moon and virgo Rising. But I'm quite sensitive myself. I hate it when some Aries are just really selfish and childish and don't give a shit about people's feelings but then you say something to them and they get offended. Don't say shit if you're not gonna be able to take the response... Also they're too stubborn and egocentric. Mostly Aries men. They're just DUMB sometimes hahaha... I guess my Virgo rising and my Libra moon kind of hate aries traits lol
14696,I,N,T,P,They can't control their monkey instincts...
14697,I,N,T,P,The key is to be maskless while you're still wearing a mask lmao
14698,I,N,T,P,"Yeah it's true. The boys I like usually date girls that are quite submissive and really cute, submissive way cute. Like, a lot of them couldn't live without a man. And then I think, Should I be a submissive bitch so guys will date me?? And I don't want to be a woman like that. There are many women out there that have suffered a lot because of their submissive attitude and I don't want to be like that."
14699,I,N,T,P,Yeah wtf. Why would anyone be intimidated??
14700,I,N,T,P,"Lol but he can't win an Emmy because he didn't play anything amazing or weird, he doesn't have incredible acting skills, and also he's just playing a normal character. It's not like a series about killers or The Big Bang theory where they do more acting or something... Ted's character is really basic... The end ruined everything. They didn't need a happy ending but definetly the show was a comedy show and they can't turn in into a tragedy in 40 minutes of the last episode."
14701,I,N,T,P,"Well you know the camera is not really about megapixels but colors, lense distortion... Etc. Chinese phones usually suck at cameras and mostly at selfie cameras... Samsung even though not being Chinese I think it takes shitty pics to people. I think Oppo is probably the best one in those prices."
14702,I,N,T,P,It looks like the 4a. It doesn't look premium at all. I'd buy the 4a before the 5.
14703,I,N,T,P,You're so RIGHT!! this is what I needed. Thank you.
14704,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. 

-Fellow INTP haha"
14705,I,N,T,P,"I feel identified with this. As an INTP, what if the mother is an abuser, a narcissist, a terrible mother, she treats her children like shit? We only see one part and it's the agression of the child. But what is the reason? Why would a child be agressive to their parents without a reason??? 
I would not act. And If I acted I would call child services actually."
14706,I,N,T,P,Hahaha as a Boss I would fire him. We don't talk about family at work. Hahaha
14707,I,N,T,P,"Yep. THEY CHOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN. But when you're poor and childfree, you're not choosing that..."
14708,I,N,T,P,"Yeah... When they say thrift shopping is cheaper and you buy real brands... I mean, the prices are the same or even higher to new clothes now. I don't live in the US but elsewhere anywhere it's like that. I don't see buying used clothes if they're gonna be as expensive as new ones."
14709,I,N,T,P,"I think for example Robin in How I met your mother had a great ending. She stayed loyal to her character. I mean, she couldn't have children though and SPOILER:
I hated the end of How I met your mother because Ted gets married and achieves his objective: Getting married and having children. 
SPOILER ALERT: 
The mom dies, and after maybe 40 years??? HE GOES BACK TO ROBIN AGAIN. I find it INCREDIBLY SELFISH from Ted. He just was in love with Robin ALL THE TIME. Even married. And as she couldn't have children, he thought she wasn't the one. But after his wife dying... He gets back to her. THAT'S THE WORST BETRAYAL IN THE WORLD..."
14710,I,N,T,P,"Yep. They never give interesting characters to women. I liked the character of Jodie Foster in the silence of the lambs... She's strong and powerful and a great female character. In the second movie though, Jodie didn't want to play because she falls in love with Hannibal, he escapes or something and they fall for each other. Jodie thought that the character would never do that. See?? It's the same shit always with female characters. They always fuck it up because they romanticize or make women clingy and stupid."
14711,I,N,T,P,"But she ended up doing exactly that, but with the difference that he was a vampire and he had sexual needs towards her blood Lmao it's such a stupid movie hahaha"
14712,I,N,T,P,Well the whole movie was too clingy. And then when the wolf guy did an IMPRENTATION or some shit in the little girl... PEDOPHILIA???? LOL
14713,I,N,T,P,Oh no. I don't want to achieve my 30s. Ever. I'm afraid of this. I'm usually not very social anyways but honestly I don't want to just suddenly meet new people and have to talk to them about children. It's like a nightmare. I guess we need to make groups for child free friendships...
14714,I,N,T,P,"Yes. Now they are advertising the iPhone 12 like the ONLY PHONE THAT HAS 5G. It's annoying. It's almost FRAUD or false advertising. If you listen carefully they have an advertising like: WE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT DO THIS. And it's straight up a lie. They're never the ones that do something first, maybe sometimes, but not always. Only phone with 5g?? What about the only phone that doesn't have a faster screen for nowadays technology while the price is 50% higher? 
Oh and also it's so funny in their ads they say: CALLING, MESSAGING, DOING THIS OR THAT, CLOUD... 
Apple, ANY PHONE CAN DO THOSE THINGS. Only the people that don't know about technology think Apple is a genius inventor."
14715,I,N,T,P,"In Europe is more of the same. Minimum wage 900-1000 Euros. One room in a shared appartement in a city: 600 Euros. So basically you just have 300 Euros for transport, food, expenses...

14716,I,N,T,P,"Uhmn thanks. Yes, I actually MAY have depression. But I know I won't be able to solve my depression because it comes from a problem. As I can't solve that problem because it's physical, I guess I get bitter because I see everything with a negative view... 
I don't think anyone cares about me and I don't think I have to care about anyone either because it only brings pain."
14717,I,N,T,P,"No, I didn't say that. I said that to me, everyone is the same. Every human being is the same and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter the culture because human beings think the same way and act the same way even though being in different countries."
14718,I,N,T,P,I don't think this is unpopular. Just go and look at Instagram. All those fitness girls are hot. They have millions of followers. They have the same opinion as you
14719,I,N,T,P,"I agree. But at the same time, you stay with a bittersweet sensation after watching the movie. I think that sometimes we need that Happy ending. Even though we know in real life it's not like that, that's why it's a movie. It's not real.  I love tragedy ending movies though. Yeah it would be great if just they all ended miserably. Lmao imagine Friends ending like shit. 
I remember I hated the ending of How I met your mother because it was too bittersweet..."
14720,I,N,T,P,My father is a cancer. I don't understand him. I'm an aries. We're completely different. He's negative and really passive. Also he's so weird. I don't know. He's a mysterious man. I'll never understand him.
14721,I,N,T,P,"I'm an aries and I always get along with scorps I don't know how, my friends were always Scorpios. They understand me the best. And they get me the most. Maybe it's because I have my 3rd house in Scorpio and an aries stellium un 8th house."

14726,I,N,T,P,"Yep I never say anything personal to a gemini. But of course, they even tell basic information about you to everyone. Lol."
14727,I,N,T,P,I'm skinny but I don't have a tiny waist. Skinny women usually are supposed to have more of a rectangular shape. You will never achieve a hourglass figure. Really few women are born with that figure. And if you're tall it's almost impossible you'll have that figure. But whatever. They work out a lot to get those waists I guess.
14728,I,N,T,P,"Obviously insecure women are the ones that most buy shit to look better. Look at how much we waste for beauty: skin care routine, makeup, clothes, hairstyler, hair products, gym, healthy food, supplements... Etc. Everything to look  beautiful. And also women compete between each other all the time. They're jealous and envious of each other a lot of times... That competition makes us want to achieve perfectionism..."
14729,I,N,T,P,They're the responsible of that. No one forces them to edit their pics. They're obsessed with competition and competing between each other. Instagram is like a magazine of girls that promote themselves...
14730,I,N,T,P,A naturally skinny woman doesn't have much curves. Now it looks like girls are skinny and also have slim waists like a needle. It's not usual. But it looks like it's so common because of Instagram
14731,I,N,T,P,What does gen Ed mean?
14732,I,N,T,P,"I agree. Most people I know that study science, they just repeat everything they've studied but can't think of themselves nor have their own opinion. That's exactly the opposite of scientific brain..."
14733,I,N,T,P,Too much talking but no doing.
14734,I,N,T,P,What is real?
14735,I,N,T,P,Lol science and philosophy go by hand... Those questions asked by philosophy are exactly the ones science tries to answer...
14736,I,N,T,P,I think it's not a huge difference but still. I think 99% of the girls on Instagram just fake their bodies. I'm actually sure. I don't believe in anything I see on Instagram.

14740,I,N,T,P,"ESFJ would make a good distraction. He’d befriend the powerful, prove himself to be helpful as I lay down clues for him to follow which will lead to other people and help him be trusted. Because they’re getting clues to other people, they will likely focus on those rather than me, so I’ll camp out in trees, by rivers, in caves, etc., while covering up my tracks until the day before they go looking for me so I will be the last person not in that group to survive. On the day before the group will hunt me down, I will secretly meet up with ESFJ, give him bags of berries, and tell him one isn’t poisoned. The thing is, he trusts me, so I’ll betray him by giving him bags that are all poisoned. He’ll take them back to the group, they’ll all eat them, die, and I win without having to do anything but helping people kill other people."

14791,E,N,T,P,I was wondering if there would be anyone that watched LoK here. And yes if you go on to personality database a lot of people voted that they think he’s an entp.
14792,E,N,T,P,Probably this actor named Penn Badgley. For some reason I would see him fitting Joe perfectly.
14793,E,N,T,P,:(
14794,E,N,T,P,This is actually hilarious considering that your flair is entj. So do you change it when you are on adderall or are you saying you are always on adderall?

14806,E,N,T,P,Wow this is really interesting. And I feel like the past few years I’ve been more like a type 3 than anything. I’ve just had high ambitions of being successful and wanting to be known and respected.
14807,E,N,T,P,Is that what that’s called? There’s the “w” type like 5w4 and then there’s what I put in my post called the tri-type? I just started learning about enneagram and I don’t know much about it.

14852,I,N,F,J,would say skype is ENTP.
14853,I,N,F,J,"that's why i specifically said immature, they come across as extremely clingy, and if i'm honest, there was nobody clingier than me when i was less mature, if i ever met my past self, i'd burn it, but hey whatever ends well is well.

let immaturity alone, sometimes unhealthy types can be pretty uncomfortable to be around, it really depends."
14854,I,N,F,J,"well not gonna lie, as an INFJ, i find INTPs amazing, doesn't mean there aren't other types that you can get along with perfectly. in my case, INFPs, ENTPs, ENFPs, ISTPs, maybe even every other type, just depends."
14855,I,N,F,J,"while that might be true, INFJs can easily blend it and seem extroverted, but i forgot the movie so i'm not sure what does he behave like alone or what he thinks like."

14858,I,N,F,J,isn't it also why INFPs are amazing?
14859,I,N,F,J,"depends on how the argument is, if it got needlessly heated, admitting you're in the wrong can be tough to anyone which can also be embarassing, if its a chill argument, its just the more you know."
14860,I,N,F,J,yes you are a good bot.
14861,I,N,F,J,"idk about the Robin Hood one, he really seems like a pure INFJ stereotype, haven't seen much of the movies tho neither do i remember them, so i think i might be wrong."
14862,I,N,F,J,"as an INFJ, i kinda find other INFJs kinda annoying, at least the immature ones, then again that's my same reaction towards any immature type."
14863,I,N,F,J,"you got it right i'm gonna say, except for ISTJ tho, i get along with them pretty well, extra points for ENTJ accuracy."
14864,I,N,F,J,"yeah, so far it happened to me once, i was pretty surprised that just talking about society morals is considered deep edgy talk, not gonna lie, i feel worried about future generations. yeah let alone when i mention my love for philosophy, it's like i'm no longer human to them."
14865,I,N,F,J,"damn, you ever just speak out your thoughts and just immediately get called an edgy kid who seeks attention?"
14866,I,N,F,J,got anything to say? Kira-Yoshkage?

14872,I,N,F,J,"come on giorno, you don't want me to start licking all over your face again do you?"
14873,I,N,F,J,"not gonna lie, those were the best days, it just felt amazing, it worked when i was a kid, as i grew, i knew it wouldn't be believable for pain to be unbearable, even when i became actually sick, my parents knew i could handle it no matter how much i tried to stay home, so yeah, the trick lost its charm. i can say it worked probably once as a teen, i still remember that day, it was amazing, crazy how one day can be so memorable and feel like it was one whole week."

14879,I,N,F,J,hmm did i hear you say your name was Kira Yoshkage?
14880,I,N,F,J,"i dont think that's the meaning of the meme, but anyway, for real why would INFJs dislike INTPs? maybe they're too cute they give us further existential crisis?"
14881,I,N,F,J,"nah its the opposite,"

14883,I,N,F,J,to LWIAY this goes.
14884,I,N,F,J,"even with the function differences, there is a lot in common between INFP and INFJ, the difference is much clearer when you got a knowledge of what each function does in each position tho."
14885,I,N,F,J,wait that looks like taken personal to non INFJs? i'm pretty sure he just elaborated tho.
14886,I,N,F,J,"yeah, don't worry i'm sure your intents are nothing far from good, but still, mass thinking and many people want to know things about him or other things, to the point it's almost intruding pewd's kindness and privacy, who felt bad for even asking for selfies to stop, let alone asking them to stop asking things, he's just turning a blind eye on things like these, doesn't mean we should feel free to keep asking."
14887,I,N,F,J,"that's his personality, if anything, i'm sure his issue is he doesn't understand other people's emotions, he only knows himself very well, and of course, actions speak louder than words, whatever it is that he says, its clear that what he says isn't exactly what he implies, there are so many times he made sacrifices.

 and to prove my idea, in the ending, he was trying to not show any emotion towards Reimi, until he spoke honesty, don't forget his character development, he was introduced as a villain, and slowly turned to our hero's side.

 in the anime, we see that Josuke and Rohan don't exactly get along well, but that's mainly because of how they met, Rohan just held the grudge, trust me when I say that they really could be best friends.

 once again my theory for this one, Araki loves Rohan, and Araki stated that Josuke is his favorite jojo because he's the one he relates too so much, which means Josuke is almost a projection of Araki's personality, idk how to conclude this comment soo.."

14896,I,S,F,P,"Oh man, this is difficult, my closest friend is an INFJ, and we super connect in one things and super disconnect and don't get one another in others"
14897,I,S,F,P,"Great advice, will do"
14898,I,S,F,P,How?
14899,I,S,F,P,"Got it, thanks for reassuring"
14900,I,S,F,P,"That makes sense, thanks for the advice"
14901,I,S,F,P,"Yeah, you're right, thanks for your advice"
14902,I,S,F,P,"Hmm, okay, thank you for sharing what you would've wanted, than I should probably really do nothing"
14903,I,S,F,P,"Right, I'm not thinking about contacting him, as I said I respect his wishes a lot, I'm just thinking of the ways to not let him drown you know, so, I think I'll just bring some of his favorite foods and will leave near his door, do you think it'll be okay? He tends to forget to eat and is very skinny"
14904,I,S,F,P,"I never thought that I can make love (not sex) with someone I won't be in a romantic relationship, but after all the thought process I think I can and want to keep doing this until he finds someone who is also ""great at making love to his mind"".
So, I'll probably just let it all be and will look at what will happen, without any extra 10h long reflections."
14905,I,S,F,P,"I think that he genuinely loves me as a person, that's probably why he treats me like a girlfriend. I know that he can detach emotional aspect from sex, but this is different.

I want our relationship to be inspiring, educational, supporting and trusting. If we can do it without romance, than it's okay with me.

His heart was given to one girl, he loves her for 8 years now, as she rejected him 4 years ago but still stayed as a good friend, he can't fully get over it. Nevertheless, in this 8 years he had 5 relationships that all lasted around a year, and he genuinely loved them all, different from that one and only girl, but still"
14906,I,S,F,P,"I don't really know, I think that I love him a bit more platonically, have more philia and agape, but I know if he would have suggested I would happily agree on a full relationship. But I guess for me it's more important to see him happy, and if it's with someone else, then.. you know, it's okay.

I didn't ask, because I know if he'll start a list of reasons I'll want to argue with each and every one and the conversation will bring sadness to both of us, do you think I should still ask? 
He said several times that we should just not think to much about it and just enjoy ourselves. That he doesn't want to reflect on all of that for now, he ""built a temporary wall around this topic"".

The reason why I was conflicted first couple of days because he treated me as a girlfriend, taking every opportunity to touch me, say something cute, kissing, even on the streets with other people around, paying for me even if I protest.. so yeah, he only yesterday said that he doesn't see this potential, and he can always look at a person and say if they will work out or not"
14907,I,S,F,P,"Well I mostly needed the opinions to understand what I should do really, thanks for your answer."
14908,I,S,F,P,"Yes, the regular tests type me either ESTP or ISTP

Also some friends say ""you always seemed like a more logical person to me""; ""you think an analyze a lot, you must be a T type"".. Bullshit, I wasn't able to relate to any other description except ISFP, and yes, learning cognitive functions helped a lot"
14909,I,S,F,P,"Drive, La La Land, Blade Runner, Annihilation.

For romance the recent good one was ""Portrait of a lady on fire"" (however the love in this film is between two women, if it may be something you don't wanna watch).

I this an ISFP can also appreciate some good old surrealism, like from Twin Peaks or any other Lynch movie"
14910,I,S,F,P,"Like check it out, it's so amazing, and the lyrics, so relatable, it doesn't even have much from stereotypes."
14911,I,S,F,P,Nice answer
14912,I,S,F,P,Can you easily accept the dark side both in yourself and your close ones?
14913,I,S,F,P,"INFP
INFJ
Top 2 for love and friendship
ENTP
ESFJ
ENTJ
ESFP
Top 4 for just having a great and easy time, no hardcore conversations though"
14914,I,S,F,P,"Omg, I didn't expect someone to think the same way as me, can agree and relate to your answer 100%"
14915,I,S,F,P,"It may be an unpopular opinion, but I personally try to avoid any interactions with ENFPs, I met quite a bunch of you guys, and most of them were too, you know, happily stuck in fantasies.
I try to guide them in the real world, say what better to do at work settings, and they say ""yes, yes"" and still do their own way, and then getting fired from a job, or scolded by the manager..

I know, not all of you like that, but I just can't stand people who don't listen to common sense.. or to me when I try to genuinely help, you know 

That's said, most ISFPs like ENFPs, so it's okay"
14916,I,S,F,P,"Jesus people.. he is an ISFP


https://youtu.be/hl1N_J773YQ"
14917,I,S,F,P,There is nothing better to do in life than to watch INFP with INFJ together
14918,I,S,F,P,95% of us are not very artistic
14919,I,S,F,P,"""The ISFP Personality is the least written about personality type. The ISFP Personality type struggles are even less written about.""

Oh, maan that's a bit sad :("
14920,I,S,F,P,It looks like my handwriting.. especially those little sun and plants appearing out of nowhere. Cool
14921,I,S,F,P,"Oh man, who actually wants to befriend someone like yourself, it's not going to be very productive, those conversations. Better to find someone with different functions to learn while talking"
14922,I,S,F,P,"Ahhh, so accurate, let me jump into some side projects, reading about MBTI, and don't do my actual work!"
14923,I,S,F,P,"Bullshit, 95% of ISFPs doesn't flirt like that"
14924,I,S,F,P,"If it's always like that, I think we get used to it pretty quick.
You can address this question to your ISFP, her answer will be better than what we can say here anyway"
14925,I,S,F,P,"I actually had a pretty similar story with my INFP (M).
Also same social group (we were actually in charge of 6 thousand people community about games and philosophy, did so much together), same insane deep connection, also 5 years..

Yeah I believe there is nothing quite like it, two high Fi people with same values and interests, so nothing like ISFP-INFP connection

Btw, he is the love of my life and nothing will change it, even after years of not seeing or talking to him"
14926,I,S,F,P,"If you think of yourself as a Messiah than you probably don't have a ""golden heart"".
We don't know you so can't judge property of course, but we can give an advice, try to grow up and about cognitive functions read some literature, something from Carl Jung for a start and you'll have a better understanding of your real type"
14927,I,S,F,P,Yes
14928,I,S,F,P,:)
14929,I,S,F,P,"He is freaking introvert, always said that he is + added that he oftey feels awkward in conversations. And making 1 video a day for 10+ years? This is some ISTJ dedication and consistency. Not even mentioning his recent video on workout routine, he tries to exercise every day adding the intensity by little, if this doesn't shout at you SiTe than I don't think you know him, or cognitive functions well"
14930,I,S,F,P,"All can be selfish but in different ways.

For example Fi people may act selfish to people they don't care about and give their life to people they value, Fe people in general try to be selfless with all people around, but more often than not can because of that neglect close relationships"
14931,I,S,F,P,"No, but as you are an ISFP we can feel that with INFPs often, there is usually a special connection with mutual understanding between us"
14932,I,S,F,P,"You have the biggest YouTuber being an ISTJ, clearly people outside the stereotypes think your pretty cool"
14933,I,S,F,P,INFP/INFJ
14934,I,S,F,P,This question pops up like every week
14935,I,S,F,P,"And you know us, it's not like ISFPs have a lot of friends, so.."
14936,I,S,F,P,"They are not rare, the data is flawed. 
I have 2 close textbook INFJ friends that were confirmed by psychologists and met a couple others that I guess are INFJs, but can't confirm for sure"
14937,I,S,F,P,"Yeah, for sure, you don't sit and cry about ""intuitives think we are dumb"" or shit like that and just do your job of being a good, productive human.

XSFJs are the most underrated types on reddit"
14938,I,S,F,P,"For me it was this one http://jung.test.typologycentral.com/l

The only test that should the correct result"
14939,I,S,T,P,So real
14940,I,S,T,P,I’ve had major procrastination problems for as long as I can remember
14941,I,S,T,P,How did this happen. Asking for a friend
14942,I,S,T,P,Very inaccurate
14943,I,S,T,P,My favorite director
14944,I,S,T,P,Anything but that. Idk that word has always made me cringe lol. But your overall take was kinda accurate tbh
14945,I,S,T,P,"Ugh, the word adorable 🤮"
14946,I,S,T,P,ENTJ probably
14947,I,S,T,P,No
14948,I,S,T,P,Never thought an ENFP would seek advice on how to flirt
14949,I,S,T,P,Nope
14950,I,S,T,P,"Dang, you really know how we function. Respect"
14951,I,S,T,P,I don’t know what you’re talking about.

14953,I,S,T,P,Digging the Sly Cooper love
14954,I,S,T,P,"I don’t like considering reality as a “level”. Level 1 is the van, 2 the hotel, 3 the snow fortress, and then limbo"
14955,I,S,T,P,Level 4 should be limbo right?
14956,I,S,T,P,Being mechanical and fix it
14957,I,S,T,P,"Sly 2 had the best in-episode music, while sly 3 had the best main theme"
14958,I,S,T,P,"2 is definitely better. Jobs and episodes were more engaging, and it felt like the stakes were higher in each one"
14959,I,S,T,P,Didn’t he use it as a totem when he was doing a sample dream in Mombasa?
14960,I,S,T,P,"Does nobody else have projections when they’re in the dream, most specifically the snow one? Bc it’s only Fischer and Cobb it seems like."
14961,I,S,T,P,I like action adventure. Games with an engaging story. Telltale games are fun as well
14962,I,S,T,P,Never related to something more
14963,I,S,T,P,"Yes, because it’s a masterpiece."
14964,I,S,T,P,Favorite job in the game

14966,I,S,T,P,How many users?
14967,I,S,T,P,Nahhh
14968,I,S,T,P,"As an ISTP, I can say with near certainty that we are pretty avid gamers"
14969,I,S,T,P,"Tripping. That mission was fantastic, as well as the entire episode"
14970,I,S,T,P,"This was very interesting read, especially for an ISTP (M) such as myself. And even moreso because ENFP is the most common type I know. My closest friend in college was an ENFP (M) and another close friend from college is an ENFP (F) (I had feelings for her)

I can't think of any best friends that I know that have had this kind of relationship that you have, especially at that young of an age (traveling across the country together alone, while one has a girlfriend). The only explanation that I can think of is that he does have feelings for you, but is just too scared/nervous to reveal it. Us ISTPs find it very difficult to admit something like this, and I can only imagine it would be even harder for him considering he's been this close with you for 11 years. He is probably saying that he like it the way it is because he does in fact not want to ruin your friendship."
14971,I,S,T,P,That’s a good list of games right there
14972,I,S,T,P,"Story was undoubtably the worst. Whole thing felt all over the place. Arkham Knight character was botched, tank battles got frustrating, side missions such as Hush were a massive letdown, and too much Joker being shoved down our throats."
14973,I,S,T,P,"In the 3rd DLC, the fight on the rooftop of the tall building with sable was RUFF"
14974,I,S,T,P,"Wow, it was right. Impressive."
14975,I,S,T,P,Same.
14976,I,S,T,P,"ISTP is very innacurate, at least for me"

15004,I,N,T,P,"Saving up for Raymond. I had Raymond on my island a month ago and he was my favorite of my islanders. But when the 1.1.2 patch dropped, suddenly his house was an empty plot, where Static moved in. I am now on a mission to retrieve him from Nintendo’s grasp."

15011,I,N,T,P,"“Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” — Frederic Bastiat, The Law"
15012,I,N,T,P,Appreciate it

15028,E,N,T,J,Istp in my case
15029,E,N,T,J,"Thank you so much for this. It was very informative to get an insight on someone elses experience. I let myself go in the last year so im really trying to go back. Seeing your progress was also very inspiring, again that you so much!!"
15030,E,N,T,J,"Thank you so much for replying! And yes i am starting out and ive found it very difficult, especially when i try to cut my favorite foods and then getting hungry at night. I just cant seem to do it. Did you ever feel that way?"
15031,E,N,T,J,What is your routine if you dont mind my asking?
15032,E,N,T,J,I feel super called out lmfao
15033,E,N,T,J,"Oh no i agree, she would have gotten in there herself lol. I only added me because afterwards she looked and laughed at me telling me ""damn that couldve gotten crazy for you"". She says she isnt but i always tell her to chill whenever she claps at people because with her its sooo easy to get her on her bad side.she got into an argument with my younger brother, who in all fairness is a bit of a problem, and she was ready to go, knife out and everything."
15034,E,N,T,J,Theres some people who have told her she seems like an ESFP.
15035,E,N,T,J,"She argues when she wants me lol. Shes not axious at all, shes extremely confident. Shes not very vocal unless she wants something, shes also very strong so shes 50/50 on everything, ill do something for her she immediately needs to do something to help. But even then we are very emotionally connected and know when to be soft on one another. I treat her with care, i make sure shes knows how important she is from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed."
15036,E,N,T,J,She argues with me just to fuck. I cant say it hate it though.i do love the fact that she is the way she is. Afterwards shes extremely calm and quiet. She just goes about her day.
15037,E,N,T,J,Its so much pressure at times lmfao.
15038,E,N,T,J,"I love her very much but shes super confrontational. Most situations she gets very active for lack of better word, and then shell says shes not or she doesnt. Im a very vocal and confrontational person but after i met her ive been more careful about what i say and do. But there have been some situations where it almost got out of hand because of her lol. In this particular situation we were grocery shopping and my shoulder was split in two places and i had lost my voice so i wanted to be out of there quickly. I was tired and in pain so i just wanted to leave, so we get in line and i tell her im gonna go get the car and park closer to the entrance. So we get out i go get the car and this guy parks directly in front of the entrance and the tries to argue with me about how i was in the corner. So i just laughed and told him to fuck off and when he starts to leave i hear rachel (my girlfriend) screaming at him and egging him on. I tell her to forget it and get in the car and shes still screaming and spent the whole day mad about it. It made me think that she got a thrill out of almost getting me in a fight."
15039,E,N,T,J,"My girlfriend is an ISTP and she does this everytime we argue, it can be over the smallest thing. I'll tell her lets just stop and take a moment to relax and shell listen but then she'll mumble ""you never talk about your feelings"" and it fucking triggers me everytime lol."
15040,E,N,T,J,This is literally my wife lmfao
15041,E,N,T,J,"Ive been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. She's an istp, and ive never fallen for anyone like i fell for her. I just wanted to spend time with her. Back when we first started dating i was not able to tell her how i felt so i would buy her whatever she wanted and i would cook for her all the time. She caught up quickly and told me straight up ""do you want to live together"" at first i thought it was too soon but i did it anyway. Point is, and idk about any other entj's out there, if they let their guard down for you, they must really like you."
15042,E,N,T,J,"Im not jealous at all! I never really have been. My girlfriend is an infp and she gets jealous at times but when anything happens where i should be, i just brush it off.at first she thought it was weird for me to not care, but she  appreciates it now. She says it makes her feel trusted."
15043,E,N,T,J,My ex girlfriend was an entj 8w7 and im an entj 5w6. At first it started okayish but as time went on we were wayy to similar in certain things. The ending of that relationship was literal war.
15044,I,N,F,J,"This is incredible! The Raven Queen subplot from C1 (vague to avoid spoiling others) reallly meant a lot to me, and I’m presuming it meant a lot to you too. What a great way to explore such a heavy topic with dignity and with a beautiful narrative. I never thought I would get a tattoo but I’ve recently been pondering getting a small raven feather. I love to see how CR has such an incredible influence on all of our lives."
15045,I,N,F,J,"Percy is incredible, don’t zone out or you’ll miss some his witty comments, aha! I watched c2 first and then went back to C1 during quarantine hiatus, not expecting myself to like it as TM9, but then falling madly in love with VM characters and storyline...

Percy is a big reason for it ;) but in all honesty, such a great character and I’m still marveling over how Percy-Taliesin and Caduceus-Taliesin are the same person..."
15046,I,N,F,J,"Soooo unrealistic smh, not even Liam would believe it"
15047,I,N,F,J,I love it aha!
15048,I,N,F,J,Oooh that’s a neat idea too
15049,I,N,F,J,Also an excellent title idea xD
15050,I,N,F,J,"When I binged C1 a few months ago, I was listening to the episode and not paying attention when it happened and I was SO CONFUSED and rewatched it like 3x before I realized what had happened, lol. Needless to say I was very impressed lol"
15051,I,N,F,J,"^^^ this is a very important lesson for any DM out there and it’s a lesson I’ve had to learn the hard way. When your plot hinges on the party finding a secret box in a house they may or may not investigate and have to roll high to find it in the first place, things can get real awkward when they pass it up completely...

And also, yes, Matt’s improv skills are clearly a gift from the gods, I’m always in awe of him"
15052,I,N,F,J,"Yes! I only caught it cause someone in the YT comments mentioned it. Sam did an excellent job with detailing this character SO MUCH. That, plus using “Veth” “Bren” (which of course warranted a hilarious reaction from Liam) and “Nato” as fake names, scattered throughout early episodes... man, Sam Riegel, everybody."
15053,I,N,F,J,"Right! Thanks! I didn’t know Tal had said anything, now I need to go rewatch it aha."
15054,I,N,F,J,"Wait, I’m just curious, which episode did he mention the Molly thing? Was that 105 or was that before?"
15055,I,N,F,J,^^^
15056,I,N,F,J,HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! US CRITTERS LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!
15057,I,N,F,J,"Oh that’s a very good point, I didn’t even think of that 😳 that would’ve been absolutely heartbreaking!!"
15058,I,N,F,J,I was TERRIFIED that we were gonna lose Beau or Jester 😂
15059,I,N,F,J,Just a lapse in memory ;) https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/1291625895287910402?s=21
15060,I,N,F,J,Even better! 😂
15061,I,N,F,J,"Ikr, this is hilarious. The amount of crushes in TM9 is getting to a comical level and I love it. At this rate, I wouldn’t batt an eye if Caduceus stood up in the middle of a tavern conversation and loudly proclaimed his love for like, Fjord or someone xD"
15062,I,N,F,J,"Yes he did and I just watched it, I can’t remember which one though 😂 I’ll see if I can find it"
15063,I,N,F,J,"You’re gonna love it, but man, was it heartbreaking."
15064,I,N,F,J,"Oh my god. Please. I need this, that is a BRILLIANT idea!"
15065,I,N,F,J,"Yes, reaction pictures accepted, I will be using them forever for now on 😂 now we just need it in gif form..."
15066,I,N,F,J,That was pretty great ahah. Long live Spurt.
15067,I,N,F,J,"I know!!! I was just thinking that. I remember seeing Matt talk about how the middle of a campaign is always his favorite and I really can see why. It’s interesting though, cause I feel like SO MUCH has happened with these characters already and a lot of their goals have been completed already, their secrets revealed, and their pasts explored. So now I feel like we’re entering a period of character growth where the world gonna start changing them, and in ways no one could e expected.

Especially now that the war is over, and they’re starting to make connections to Tal’Dorei, we really are on an ENTIRELY new chapter for TM9. I’m really excited to see where all this leads :)"
15068,I,N,F,J,"This was definitely my favorite reaction from the cast, ever. Travis and Marisha especially... it was amazing watching their delayed reactions!

For me, the episode definitely makes top 10, maybe top 5! My favorites of c2 are:

93 (cupcake episode) at the very top, followed closely behind by, in no particular order: 

85 (jester’s dad confirmed, Beau and Nott trade secrets)

97 (Veth transformation)

102 (for reasons mentioned by OP, but also don’t forget the amusement of Yasha + Beau!)

49 (A Game Of Names)

92 (Beau backstory)

In general, although I’ve enjoyed the entire campaign, I feel like they really hit their stride around 85 and all the episodes have been on fire since! So much has happened!"
15069,I,N,F,J,"Yes!! And I loved the delayed reaction. When he first said Vilya, and they were like “OHHHHH” I was like, well, they seemed excited, but not as excited as I though they would be (or as excited as I was!) and I was like, hm, that’s weird. I’m glad Sam was like “you know who that is, though...? Because watching them go like “wait, what” and the realize and freak the heck out was HILARIOUS"
15070,I,N,F,J,"Yes! Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love the c2 characters and i know the cast adores them to, but I think that mainly boils down to playing a character for 5 years and staring this incredible live stream with these characters..."
15071,I,N,F,J,True! I almost forgot about the rakshasa aha. That was pretty great.
15072,I,N,F,J,"That’s a good theory, I think that’s totally possible! Fingers crossed, I’d love to see that happen"
15073,I,N,F,J,Yes we did!!!
15074,I,N,F,J,"If you look at some of the other comments on this post, you’ll see that we were discussing that, but the general idea is that apparently they’re exactly 2 weeks into the future, meaning last night they filmed 104, and Sam was looking at the stream for 100, when she was first introduced and the fandom was pretty quick to catch on :)

That’s interesting, I didn’t notice a hard cut, but now that you mention it, I’m gonna go look at it..."
15075,I,N,F,J,"Yeah, that’s what I’m curious about. I could see it both ways, I’m guessing the players (for the most part) are gonna defer to Matt and whatever clues he drops for them, whether he indicates he wants them to follow her to Tal’Dorei or if she’s insistent on going by herself. He might want them to go just for a bit (and of course, to satisfy player curiosity) and then have some issue from Wildmount call them back. It would be pretty cool for TM9 have a small trip over to TD...

But I guess we’ll just have to see!"
15076,I,N,F,J,"Ohh, got it. I thought that they just recorded things earlier in the week / just not on a Thursday. Out of curiosity, did they confirm this somewhere?

But hey, I guess the point still stands in that the fandom got to it a lot sooner in the storyline, if not in real life 😂"
15077,I,N,F,J,"Oh, are they 2 weeks ahead? Didn’t know that. I was confused by Sam’s comment at the end of the episode about him checking to see how many people were watching"
15078,I,N,F,J,"Yes! Again, not to say that there are players who are worse (cause, obviously they’re not, they’re just as wonderful) but Liam and Taliesin really do take a shine in that light, and a lot of it is thanks to Matt. I don’t think people are intentionally leaving Matt out, of course, but rather I think his conversations / NPCs are so good that they’re almost... normalized? And we just have to take a step back to appreciate it and just say... damn. These people are amazing"
15079,I,N,F,J,"I was gonna comment that, I think Dani and Brian has deep regrets 😂 but it was hilarious lol. Not very productive, but hilarious"
15080,I,N,F,J,"One of my favorite things about this is that ALL of the possible combinations are just WONDERFUL and unique and I think that’s one of the things that makes CR amazing. But, with that being said...

My favorites are Liam and Laura for reasons mentioned above,

But also Liam and Matt. Like, the convos between Vax and the Raven Queen, Caleb and Essek, Caleb and Astrid... those are some of the best conversation, especially with their complexity, depth, emotion, and themes... beautiful."
15081,I,N,F,J,"Just checked, yes it is! Thanks! :D"
15082,I,N,F,J,Good to know I’m not the only one 😂 I’ll check it out again this afternoon and see if that’s the case
15083,I,N,F,J,Awesome! Thx you so much! I’ll take a look at 91 and get back to everyone on that aha
15084,I,N,F,J,"INFJ, can confirm, especially “worst” side"
15085,I,N,F,J,"I haven’t checked their stats in a while but I’ll take your word on that, point still stands 😉😂"
15086,I,N,F,J,"13. I feel like scores on this doesn’t really coincide with having aphantasia, which is interesting"
15087,I,N,F,J,"... how did I not know that Port Damali was north of Nicodranas? I always imagined it the other way around, and with a nearly straight N-S coast line 😂 but excellent job! So cool!"
15088,I,N,F,J,This is hilarious 😂 well done!
15089,I,N,F,J,"I loved that so much! Her story may not have been as extremely despicable as Liam’s, but the inconspicuous and innocent feign of forgetfulness at the end that ended up making everyone blame the others of failure was hilarious and and evil, and I love her for that 😂"
15090,I,N,F,J,"If this doesn’t make a react video because of his break, someone please repost this next week so we can get answers 😂"

15095,E,N,T,P,"Yeh for sure.. but its like, im losing for this ""random shit"" and not because he is better than me, u know. I can lose 2-0 and he is better than me and I'm chill, I know he's better atm so GG, but sometimes..."
15096,E,N,T,P,I'm thinking to pay 10$ on Steam for WR3D and then put this mod in (WR3D 2K21). Is it worth it? Can I have this game for free? Thank you guys!
15097,E,N,T,P,"Hey bro! Thank u for the answer. Im new on pes. I dont play football games since 2017 (I have always been a FIFA player) and this year im playing PES for the first time. I am 600 rated player but my defense is not so good, everybody has van dijk, ramos, puyol, beckenbauer... When I am with Gabriel (90) and Skriniar (89). I always score so much goals but players like Rumenigge, Torres, CR7, Messi.. they always fuck up my CB, and my LB is Bellerin (86) and my RB, Tierney (90). 

Could you give me some tips to improve? In the attack I got Cruyff/Bergkamp with Mbappe/Auba + Messi, so the attack is not a problem, my biggest problem is that I am always dealing against 95 rated CF against my ~90 CB with no speed... 

Thank you bro! 🙏🏻"
15098,E,N,T,P,yes! its the barça retro kit (2006) from club edition. I can use it on myclub
15099,E,N,T,P,"Exactly. U gotta play the meta if u wanna win, and then, when u play meta.. u gotta pray if u dont wanna get owngoals by ur defenders 😅"
15100,E,N,T,P,"Its good. I take 1-2 min to find a game, no problem. The lag is about 1 of 5 games"
15101,E,N,T,P,"hey bro, what app is that? thank u"
15102,E,N,T,P,Done!
15103,E,N,T,P,Ole is doing good for me.

15107,E,N,T,P,Ese portero es Rulli.. jajajaj
15108,E,N,T,P,"I got Son, Chillwell and this one.

15117,E,N,T,P,thank u!
15118,E,N,T,P,"Mmmm, Im playing with Ole soljskaer and Sabatini (same but ole has ED-EI and Sabatini has ID-II and his attack/def tactits are almost the same) but they have possesion + short pass and I wanna play counterattack + short/long pass so... can you tell me the best counterattack DT? thank u bro, i will revise guardiola and simeone again!!! thank u"
15119,E,N,T,P,Are they tickets to go still open?
15120,E,N,T,P,Caldirola is worth it at 90?
15121,E,N,T,P,"Could U upload it on PS4? Ty bro  looks amazing and i want it on my universe, thank u brio!!"
15122,E,N,T,P,Can u upload this' so awesome bro!!
15123,E,N,T,P,"in what position will you play with becham? I dont like him as ID so much, and When I play with him as DMF he is so good with someone who can defend. Where would you put it?"
15124,E,N,T,P,im playing in defense with Young - Martynovich - Caldara - Bellerin cause i got no defenders XD fuck this game hahaha sometimes I put Rikjaard as CB but...
15125,E,N,T,P,"I feel you bro. I got Vardy, Kane, Martial, Greenwood, Mbappe, Lacazette, Auba... everything DC and not CT, just Calderola XD"
15126,E,N,T,P,"Thats happening to me: My friends getting Van Dijk, Alaba, Arnold, Mbappe, Lewa, S. Ramos... me getting correa, lacazette, aurier, muller... just not CT in 2 weeks... any CT, any. So unlucky this year."
15127,E,N,T,P,"Ive read u dont need to uninstall, just got the key of the club edition u want and it will work like a DLC.. could this work? thanks! I wanna keep Barça kit 😬"
15128,E,N,T,P,"So Will I have the barça kit + man utd kit or what? I mean, the kit is not so much relevant to me, Coins and Beckham IM are so... Ty!"
15129,E,N,T,P,"So, If I've bought the Barça edition first, and then I buy Man Utd edition; I only keep the Man utd edition? Thank u! 

&#x200B;

I prefer the barça kit than Man Utd kit, so... could i keep the barça kit? ty!"
15130,E,N,T,P,"Ty for the answer! But I gotta uninstall the game? I mean, I have the Barça pre-order edition, so If i wanna buy the ManUtd edition, just I should buy it from instang-gaming, put the key on steam, and what else? Ty!"
15131,E,N,T,P,"I read that u dont need to unintall, just buy the game from instant-gaming and then just put the key on Steam and they will give u the dlc with the club edition etc etc... 

ty bro! I mean, does ur son lost the inicial kit of the club edition etc? how it was? ty!"
15132,E,N,T,P,"They wont give me, for example, Beckham IM if I get the ManUtd key?"
15133,E,N,T,P,"If I have a Barça edition... Will I lost my barça retro kit, Messi IM...? I mean, I pre-order barça edition and i want the coins, and instead of buying coins alone, I buy ManUtd edition, they will give me beckham + coins + agents eec etc without losing anything in my old acc?? ty!"
15134,E,N,T,P,Up
15135,E,N,T,P,ty bro!
15136,E,N,T,P,Thank you bro!
15137,E,N,T,P,thank u! what ur playstyle? counterattack or posession?
15138,E,N,T,P,"So, For example, If I pre-order FC Barcelona Club Edition on Steam, and now, I wanna buy 2k coins, but instead of buying alone, Can I get a code about MUtd club edition and use it on steam even tho I have my FC Barcelona running on my steam acc? What will they give me about MANUtd edition? Beckham and what else? thanku!

&#x200B;

Will I lose my IM Messi? Ty!!"
15139,E,N,T,P,done

15141,E,N,T,P,DOone!
15142,E,N,T,P,Can someone tell me if this works? thank you!
15143,E,N,T,P,Done bro!
15144,I,N,F,P,You’re pretty much describing this sub lmao
15145,I,N,F,P,"Hey I mean as long as ur stuff doesn’t come back pink then I guess you’re good. I know people have been saying that bd8o said something about shipping out pink stuff to people in the guilded chat but I’m not on there so idk for sure. I guess we will find out if we start seeing posts of people with pink carts haha. So far people say their stuff is alright, but those pictures going around of their pink disty makes me want to stay away from them. Who knows maybe if nobody called them out they would’ve shipped the pink crap to people, maybe they still will. Maybe this is all bullshit drama and nothing is actually wrong with their product. We’ll just have to wait and see what people get. Personally I don’t want to be one of those guinea pigs"
15146,I,N,F,P,"Really I think the biggest concern is their disty quality, the pictures of the purple distillate definitely doesn’t look appetizing haha"
15147,I,N,F,P,Rippp try to chargeback if ur worried. All I can say is that you get what you pay for
15148,I,N,F,P,Edibles will but not carts
15149,I,N,F,P,"Fuck dude this makes me wish I didn’t have to stay inside all day doing work haha, I can’t wait until midterms are over so I can go outside and get stoned lol"
15150,I,N,F,P,"I’m just curious what’s wrong with snapdragon, I just bought a bunch of their edibles is there anything I should be worried about?"
15151,I,N,F,P,I would probably order from somewhere else
15152,I,N,F,P,All I can say is you get what u pay for
15153,I,N,F,P,"I just finished it like an hour ago. I’m really sad it’s over which is kind of why I’m on this subreddit rn lol. I don’t think I’m ready to be done with this show yet, it’s probably one of the best I’ve seen"
15154,I,N,F,P,"That’s what I was thinking lol, poor guy took too much"
15155,I,N,F,P,Bernie is based
15156,I,N,F,P,You’ve got some good taste!
15157,I,N,F,P,I think every type can be creative in their own way. Creativity goes far beyond being able to paint or write.
15158,I,N,F,P,Tbh I wouldn’t have it any other way
15159,I,N,F,P,I hate competition lol
15160,I,N,F,P,I can’t even lie I agree
15161,I,N,F,P,I can’t argue with that
15162,I,N,F,P,"I’ve placed like 4 orders in the past month or two, all without a problem. Might order more today lol"
15163,I,N,F,P,Kinda sus
15164,I,N,F,P,3chi have some of the best carts. Snapdragon has carts as well as awesome edibles
15165,I,N,F,P,"If I had more money I’d buy a half ounce and a dab rig haha, I really want to see how dabbed d8 compared to carts and edibles"
15166,I,N,F,P,I have a 3chi cart and want to buy more carts but I’m also strapped for cash. How do skyhio carts compare?
15167,I,N,F,P,"I’d just start with one and go from there, one is pretty strong for me haha"
15168,I,N,F,P,Yeah I think people see feet as dirty because they’re always touching the ground but I mean most of the time people wear shoes anyways so they really aren’t that dirty at all.
15169,I,N,F,P,"Fair enough brother, nothing wrong with liking feet haha"
15170,I,N,F,P,"Their honey is great, I have two jars myself"
15171,I,N,F,P,"I love snapdragons edibles, they ship pretty quick too. Packaging is just a regular box, with a not inside for law enforcement."
15172,I,N,F,P,"I love their edibles, one honey stick is plenty for me"
15173,I,N,F,P,I knew someone was going to comment about her feet lol
15174,I,N,F,P,Nothing better than laying in bed with a cat haha
15175,I,N,F,P,"3chi for carts, snapdragon first edibles"
15176,I,N,F,P,My friend and his gf lol
15177,I,N,F,P,"https://youtu.be/bMWUa-IoQoA 

I feel like this band in particular really captures the otherworldly imagination that us INFPs tend to live in. This song in particular is serene and abstract, and the lyrics seems to be about overcoming painful emotions which is something INFPs tend to struggle with.

Plus I’ve seen 2 out of the 3 members of this band typed as INFPs lol"
15178,I,N,F,P,"It’s kind of hard to know for sure because there are a lot of mistypes out there, but I do believe infp is one of the rarer types (probably rarer than the numbers on some sites say since infp is a common mistype). I believe a lot of sites say infj is the rarest, tho personally I think enfjs are just as rare if not more so. 

Anyways the reason why INFPs look so common online is because we just spend a lot of time online lol. Introverted intuitives in general seem to be especially prevalent online, which is why there tends to be an intuitive bias on online forums and reddit (which is unfortunate). But yeah irl INFPs and other introverted intuitives are a lot harder to come by"
15179,I,N,F,P,I just like to argue ;)
15180,I,N,F,P,"Should be, the corks seal it up pretty tight, to the point where it takes a little elbow grease to get them off haha. Honey stays good for a very long time"
15181,I,N,F,P,This guy knows what’s up ;)
15182,I,N,F,P,"I’m surprise infp has the most votes, I’ve never blocked anybody on any platform lol"
15183,I,N,F,P,"I get that, my gripe is that she’s just doing it in the most pretentious way possible it seems like. Like I said I don’t even disagree with her I just think she sounds very pompous. You can say what she said without talking down to everyone who is into mbti. She’s pretty much implying that because she’s an “intellectual” she doesn’t believe in mbti. Also I think darkacademiacottege is just a username lol, just because you have academia in your username doesn’t mean that you work in academia."
15184,I,N,F,P,"$70 2240mg. I know it’s cheaper to make your own edibles but frankly I don’t want to lol, the extra cost is just paying for convenience, not to mention the honey they use is fresh and locally made stuff. It tastes a lot nicer than store bought honey and probably cost more too"
15185,I,N,F,P,"She’s on tumbler lol do you think she’s going to be recognized by any of her academic peers on there, if she even is working in academia. I don’t use tumbler but from my understanding it’s pretty anonymous like reddit. Plus it’s just a username lol, I guess we can also assume that she lives in a cottage based on her name. 

The whole first part of the post just comes off as pretentious. The fact that she’s say “I’m an intellectual” before she starts talking down on mbti seems to imply that people who are into mbti can’t be intellectuals. Not to mention anyone who starts a post off by calling themselves an intellectual is probably a little too full of themselves lol"
15186,I,N,F,P,"I think some INFPs are just mistyped ISFJs haha. I don’t really think a lot of descriptions for ISFJs do them any justice, they just make them out to be boring people pleasers which isn’t the case"
15187,I,N,F,P,"The two I don’t fit are the crybaby stereotype and the bookworm stereotype. People think that Fi makes you super emotional but Fi is more about values than it is about being emotional, emotions are not exclusive to feelers lol. 

I can never focus on a book for too long, I just start thinking about something completely different. I’m starting to get better at this thanks to college, but I used to hate reading haha."
15188,I,N,F,P,That’s awesome! Real talk tho datura sounds terrifying haha
15189,I,N,F,P,All the time lol
15190,I,N,F,P,I do enjoy indulging in recreational drugs haha
15191,I,N,F,P,"Yeah I feel like there are a lot of mistypes out there, both people mistyping as INFPs and INFPs mistyping as other types. Infp is actually a pretty common type to mistype as, especially if you’re only doing online tests and not looking into cognitive functions"
15192,I,N,F,P,"Don’t worry I’m perfectly happy with myself haha and the last time I got my physical they checked my testosterone levels which came back normal. I just don’t really feel any pressure to fit into gender stereotypes, though I do agree that healthy testosterone levels are important for men health wise"
15193,I,N,F,P,Seems less like defending herself and more like she is just shitting on mbti lol. She could’ve just said “I know mbti isn’t really backed by science but I’m an infp...” but the fact that she compares it to astrology and party games and prefaces the whole post by calling herself an intellectual just gives the whole first part of the post a mocking tone. I don’t buy into the “preemptively defending herself” thing lol

How many before you have to pay? Is it all free? Is it a sample if I take a portion sized amount of it? Is it really free if I just take it? And the list goes on and on. It's kind of a love hate relationship with this aspect for me, because I can solve problems pretty easily but again, overthinking. I would say I'm very similar to INTP's in the sense that we have dominant thinking and inferior feeling, but I also mistake myself for an intuitive type sometimes due to my ADD and constantly not focusing. I wish the mbti would focus on the Ti because while we (or I in this scenario) do have Se, I feel like I use Ti a LOT more, but my Se is pretty active as well. I hope I gave enough of an explanation for you to use, now I'll go back to fixing cars."

15222,I,S,T,P,"Seems very IxFP ish, more leaning INFP. The lashing out seems like her variation of grip stress with her Te coming in full force. There's also the fact that she isn't aware of surroundings and walks very heavily which is why I think she isn't an Se user like ISFP for example. Her rigidness in beliefs is a common Fi thing and a lot more prominent in xxFP's."
15223,I,S,T,P,Why did I think this was r/wholesomememes?
15224,I,S,T,P,ISFJ for the mom and ENTP for the dad
15225,I,S,T,P,Shadow being an INTJ is so fitting it hurts
15226,I,S,T,P,"Go work out and fix cars for ISTP, but ESTP is dum because sensor dom so work out a lot if you wanna be ESTP"
15227,I,S,T,P,Why is happy ExTJ so cursed
15228,I,S,T,P,First one looks like ExFJ and the second one looks like an IxTP imo
15229,I,S,T,P,"Sensor have sex life, I cured my INTP disorder and now my gf likes me"
15230,I,S,T,P,Glad to see my polar opposites get some attention!
15231,I,S,T,P,"Oh I somehow forgot Hitler and what he was like in his childhood, thanks for the re-education you gave (sort of)"
15232,I,S,T,P,"I don't see how Hitler was an INFJ, he has a lot of xNTJ vibes, more so ENTJ if I gotta be honest. Where does the INFJ come from?"
15233,I,S,T,P,Hey I'm a ISTProcrastinator not ISTPerfect at finishing jobs
15234,I,S,T,P,Sensor penis
15235,I,S,T,P,P stands for pooping on your assignments until it's 1 minute until the due date.
15236,I,S,T,P,"Well yes but INTPs make sex robots because they only use imagination

Or maybe....."
15237,I,S,T,P,"Hello me INTP haha

I sex robot engineer and 250 iq"
15238,I,S,T,P,iSTJ? Or maybe ESTJ?
15239,I,S,T,P,Hold my beer and my guns
15240,I,S,T,P,Wait when did smash bros mean pedophilia?
15241,I,S,T,P,"Bruh I only found out I was an ISTP a little while back with a post of mine, how has 40% of the voters never been mistyped?"
15242,I,S,T,P,"Same, they seem pretty nice and intriguing, and I can finally seem like a true American!"
15243,I,S,T,P,"I go until it literally can't be ignored, or somewhere around there.

Really, I just don't super procrastinate too much, but I procrastinate at least a little like every day lol."
15244,I,N,T,J,Wow sounds awesome! You can absolutely do it. Count me in if you create the chat!
15245,I,N,T,J,I always eat baked beans on my hot dogs so I can imagine this would also taste awesome
15246,I,N,T,J,"I’m curious about this too. I have roommates so I mostly keep to my bedroom which has proven to make me unproductive, especially during quarantine."
15247,I,N,T,J,Ok... So how do I become my best?
15248,I,N,T,J,"Thanks a lot, this is very helpful."
15249,I,N,T,J,Ok thanks
15250,I,N,T,J,What should I be contacting her about? On her first call she said during our meetings she would help coach me through my goals and discover my learning habits but she hasn’t said anything about that. I’m not really sure what the purpose of the mentor is honestly.
15251,I,N,T,J,"Thanks for the insight. If you don’t mind me asking, what do you talk about with your mentor? The only thing mine asks is what I plan to do during the week. There really isn’t any helpful conversation, I just tell her what I’m going to do and that’s the end of the conversation."
15252,I,N,T,J,"https://webcam1000.myshopify.com/

This is the link for the WGU webcam. I bought a cheap webcam from Walmart and the quality sucked so I had to suck it up and quickly order this one. It came pretty fast and it works... lol"

15254,I,N,T,J,"I’ve been using my iPad to read course material on the WGU app with no problem. I haven’t tried submitting any work on it though, I usually just use my MacBook Pro."
15255,I,N,T,J,I don’t know how you did it but you’re my motivation! Share tips please 🙏🏼
15256,I,N,T,J,Oh ok I see. Thank you. I actually just saw one on Walmart that hopefully fits the requirements.
15257,I,N,T,J,Yes it would be a great help!
15258,I,N,T,J,That’s awesome! Congrats! What program did you start out with and what was the new one?
15259,I,N,T,J,I felt this on another level...
15260,I,N,T,J,"How does mircoblading differ from tinting your brows? If you already have a medium amount of brow hair, is microblading still good to get done or would tinting have a similar effect?"
15261,E,N,F,P,"www.typeinmind.com is a good place to read about the functions of both. But the differences are that ESFP has Se Dom and Ni inferior. ENFP has Ne dom and Si inferior.

Se dom lives in the moment. They are very observant and notice details around them others often miss. They're generally very stylish, keep nice hair, makeup,etc bc appearance is important to them. They can come across as shallow sometimes bc they focus on sensory details and stimulation. They don't plan much for the future, just live things day by day. Often into working out or some form of physical activity.

Ni inferior can show as sometimes being paranoid and pessimistic. Having sudden bursts of insight into a future situation and how it will turn out. When they're under stress, they'll start to think people around them have bad intentions even when they don't.

Ne dom is very future oriented. ENFPs *love* to plan, but generally their plans don't come to fruition. Planning itself is almost as satisfying as doing, so once they've worked the whole scenario out in their mind, they can move onto the next thing. They see patterns in different situations and use those to relate things to each other. They are often lost in thought, sometimes to the point of just running into things bc they're thinking and tune out all their other senses. They are very random when they talk and will cycle through a bunch of topics in a short time. Always have a new hobby or something they're interested in learning about, but once they're learned a decent amount they're bored of it.

Si inferior relates to memory and how we file thoughts together. ENFPs can link the most random memories together bc of one small detail. Like if you tell a story about your day at work, but briefly mention a dog, they will say ""oh that reminds me"" and then tell a story that doesn't seem to be relevant at all, but it also has a dog somewhere in it. They often tune out their senses to the point that they'll forget to eat sometimes for days. Bad at keeping up with their health and what their body is telling them, but under stress they may start to notice every single thing in their body and become like a hypochondriac."
15262,E,N,F,P,"I think a lot of it relates to enneagram, since I mean core fear is pretty much the central theme of enneagram. A type 6's core fear is losing their support system. A type 7's core fear is experiencing negative emotions, which a death of a loved one is sure to cause. Type 7 is the main type for ESTPs and you'll have a decent amount of 7w6."
15263,E,N,F,P,"I'm not lazy, just a procrastinator. I'll do the whole assignment the night before it's due and we'll get an A"
15264,E,N,F,P,"As far as appearances, a good tip is ""If it's something they can fix in under 5 minutes, tell them. If they can't, then don't."" For example, if someone has food in their teeth, some hair out of place, a spot on their shirt and they're at home where they can change, pants unzipped, tell them so they can correct their appearance. If it's something that can't be easily corrected, like they're fat or have bad skin or a big nose, keep your criticisms to yourself."
15265,E,N,F,P,"When I was a teen and worked at McDonald's, they implemented a rule that you must shower and apply deodorant before work. It was obvious who it was aimed at, and it was one of the very few employees who was both over 25 and neurotypical."
15266,E,N,F,P,I mean most people who have kids have left their kid on something they fell off. Or fallen asleep and dropped them.
15267,E,N,F,P,"It could be paranoia too. That's what Ni inferior does when you're under stress, it makes you see bad intentions in other people where they don't exist, makes you paranoid and pessimistic. 

Just invite somebody to go hang out with you. Look for people who are low drama, who have never had a big blowout with a former friend or blasted somebody's secrets or tried to turn people against someone. Those kinds of people are toxic and even if they act like you now, when they get bored, it'll be you that they turn on. Look for the people that are always super friendly and kind, maybe a little quiet. Just sit down next to them and start a conversation. Then be like ""hey you seem pretty cool, wanna come over and play xbox/play some basketball/go to the football game with me"" etc whatever you like to do. Just worry about connecting with one person to start."
15268,E,N,F,P,"Oh yeah you have time. Well just know that most likely you'll be great at it in a few years, barring any neurodiversion. Find a friend that you trust, somebody you're around often, maybe a couple of them. Have them give you some kind of discreet signal (like scratching their nose or holding up their pinky) when you're annoying people, then you can look for patterns in how people act at that moment.

Some signs to look for in people that you're getting on their nerves, use that Se to observe the facial expressions and body language of people and monitor it for changes:

They go from smiling and laughing to being quiet, having cold expression

They turn their body/feet away from you, cross their arms, look away (study closed body language)

They stop answering you or start giving very short, one word answers

They start talking over you and make eye contact with everyone else in the group besides you

They roll their eyes/make big eyes while you're talking"
15269,E,N,F,P,"Usually ESTPs are really great at reading people from Fe tert. Are you young? May just need to grow into it. Also, have you ever been evaluated for autism?"
15270,E,N,F,P,"I have an ex with BPD, another with NPD (which could just as easily match the little description you gave). Neither started going to therapy until I just couldn't stand them anymore and had to leave, the BPD one has continued trying to improve I think, he's still got a long way to go but I think he's better. The NPD one went a few weeks then declared himself cured and said any further issues we have were my fault.

Personality disorders are not something you can just take a med and go away. It's not something that even months of therapy will correct. It will take years of therapy to even make a dent. NFPs are known for ending up in relationships with people with PDs because we are so good at seeing the good in people, no matter how much shit we have to look through to find it.

I used to think if I left, I was bad bc it's mental illness. I wouldn't leave someone who had cancer. It was my job to help him and get him to treatment and I would give him leeway for his behaviors because he can't help the way he is. _*THIS IS INCREDIBLY WRONG AND TOXIC THINKING*_ If he isn't doing everything he can, going to therapy, taking medication if needed, etc, trying to get better, you can't do a thing to help him. He has to come to that realization on his own. Having a mental illness is not an excuse to treat people around you like garbage. You deserve so much more. You haven't failed, you signed up for a suicide mission.

Please, for the sake of your own mental health and happiness, hang it up and move on for good. It will hurt, you'll miss him, but in a few months when you've had some separation, you'll look back and wonder what you were thinking to put up with it for so long. You don't even see how truly bad it is rn bc you've become accustomed to so much of it. Staying will just hurt you more and more and affect all future relationships, and he still won't get better. 

You can message me if you need to talk.

❤️"
15271,E,N,F,P,"I stopped answering her calls and texts for months and stopped letting her come to my house bc I was just over it. And we've slowly been talking a little and it feels like she is making an effort to be better so I'm trying, we're going out to eat with my aunt's this weekend. She's old and not in the best health so I don't want her to die with us not getting along. I do appreciate all the things she's done to help me that are actually helpful, I just have to keep firm boundaries with her. She doesn't live very close so she only comes here every couple months usually and it's been longer bc of covid. Luckily my dad is an ENTP so he understood my personality a lot better and he was my teacher in school and he was always bragging about everything I did so there was balance. My health is bad too and I split from my husband 5 years ago so my mom has tried to help so much more since then and that's when it got really overwhelming bc she treats me like I'm a kid still. But I do think it's better. Thanks for letting me see some healthier ISFJs so I can know what signs to look for that she's really improvising. And so I'm not bitter to your whole type just bc my mom is crazy lol"
15272,E,N,F,P,"You're probably healthier than you think you are. Everyone has their moments where they're a little crazy or over emotional, but being actually an unhealthy person, you're just exhausting and toxic. But my mom def shows very strong Si and Fe. She always hated my Fi growing up and would say ""why can't you just go along with everyone else, why do you have to be different all the time"" well that's the nature of Fi, it's just who I am. She would tell me to always put other people before myself and I think she feels like that's what she's doing, putting me first, but when you only do it to highlight what I'm doing wrong then it feels like I'm always being judged. I get big anxiety when she's around bc I know she'll find the one thing that isn't perfect and make a comment about it."
15273,E,N,F,P,Covert narcissism?
15274,E,N,F,P,Thanks bot
15275,E,N,F,P,"I mean at this point lots of little things she does do just annoy me, if that was the only thing I prob wouldn't have thought anything. But it's been my whole life of doing little things and me asking her not to and her not listening. But like why assume that I need makeup remover, I have plenty. Ask. A month earlier she came by unexpectedly and I hadn't brushed my hair that day bc I was just at home and then she bought me a hairbrush. One time she was babysitting my kids at my house and threw away the shower curtain I loved that matched my bathroom and put in this super ugly one bc I guess mine was dirty. Like that's just one of many, many examples so yes I have built up resentment bc she always buys me things after she notices something negative about me or my home. Like it's never just hey here's a cute necklace I saw, it's like ""oh I saw this thing dirty at your house, here's a thing to clean it"" like why do you have to bring attention to every negative thing about me.

And yes I'm sure my mom is an ISFJ. You shouldn't go by test results to determine somebody's type anyway, all online tests are very inaccurate. Like 16 personalities only gets people right about 50% of the time, my ISFJ friend tested INFP on 16p. You need to study cognitive functions to type people. Typeinmind.com is a good place to learn about functions."
15276,E,N,F,P,I'm here too if anybody wants to talk
15277,E,N,F,P,"Sleep is my go to. If I can't do that, put on a playlist of happy music, the songs I usually sing at the top of my lungs in the car to. Talk to a guy friend. Usually not a girl friend bc they tend to validate my feelings and be empathetic and agree with me and that just keeps me in the same mindset. I need a dude who is gonna be like ""that sucks"" and then send me funny memes and tell me a story about his day so I stop thinking about my problems."
15278,E,N,F,P,Sleep is my #1 go to when I'm grumpy. I almost always wake up in a better mood.
15279,E,N,F,P,"Oh yes thank you! That's exactly it, my mom is passive aggressive and always has a victim mentality. She's always doing things ""to help me"" but they're not actually helpful to me. And sometimes they feel like lowkey shade, like I went out with her after having an allergic reaction and my face had a rash. I tried to cover it with makeup but honestly it looked like shit either way cuz my face was all bumpy. The next day she casually gave me makeup remover ""just to be nice"" but it felt rude asf to me like she's saying my makeup looked like shit which yeah I know it did, but it looked even worse without. It was that or stay home. But then anytime she does something ""helpful"" and I don't want it, then she acts like she's being persecuted and nobody appreciates her...well if you asked me before doing things, then I could stop you before you did it.

My friend's issue was more with being a codependent person, although also passive aggressive. And being fake, like always going way out of her way to make her life look so perfect on social media, like long posts about how great her bf was while she was telling me she wanted to break up bc he was emotionally abusive. He ended up getting in her head about me that I was ""jealous of her happiness"" despite me having my own happy relationship bc well that's what manipulators do, try to isolate you from your friends. So we don't talk anymore, but I am hopeful that someday she'll wake up and get away from him and learn true happiness.

Anyway I'm very glad to see that there is light at the end of the tunnel and maybe they can both learn to be more healthy. I set some very strict boundaries with my mom and she does seem to be making an effort to make things better, and *ask* before trying to do things. So maybe she's starting to use that logical side more. Thanks!"
15280,E,N,F,P,"I mean I wouldn't vent to an ISFJ or do much of anything with them. But you kind of prove right here why people hate ISFJs. ""if you don't want help, don't ask an ISFJ"" if they're mad about you ""helping"" that means you're *not* helping. You're doing what *you think* is helpful and it's clearly not. If you actually cared about helping, you would ask a person what they need. Somebody to listen could be all the help they need. Instead, what you are doing is trying to control the situation. And they get mad and you say ""I was just helping"". No. You weren't. If what you did was helpful, they wouldn't be mad about it. You tried to take over and now you're playing victim bc the person didn't like it."
15281,E,N,F,P,"Thank you, this is a very thoughtful answer!"
15282,E,N,F,P,Where is your favorite place that you've traveled and where would you like to go?
15283,E,N,F,P,"Lots of people don't want help when they go to someone with a problem, they just want to vent and get it off their chest. Why not just ask people if they want help or if they just want to vent?"
15284,E,N,F,P,"My mom is an ISFJ and her always trying to ""help"" drives me CRAZY. First of all, I'm very independent by nature and help for some things makes me uncomfortable. Second of all, she just jumps in and does things and we are very different people, so often what she considers helpful are not only unhelpful to me, but make things worse bc I have to undo what she's done. And often it can feel passive aggressive and insulting to me, when she does something ""helpful"" that I didn't think needed to be done. Like trying to help me by cleaning something that looked fine to me. 

So my big piece of advice would be if you want to help someone, *_ask_* if they want help, and what you can do to help. And if they say no, then leave it alone. Staying out of a person's way is sometimes the best thing you can do for them."
15285,E,N,F,P,"I'm not an ISFJ and hate routine, but what if you just change one thing at a time and then give yourself a few weeks to become accustomed to that change before changing something else? Like the 21 days to make a habit, give yourself 3 weeks then switch another thing, then maybe it will be less overwhelming"
15286,E,N,F,P,Then I guess I'll get started... After I eat
15287,E,N,F,P,Ok remind me an hour before it's due
15288,E,N,F,P,"Te Dom: Do as I say

Ne Dom: Say something that makes fucking sense and I will"
15289,E,N,F,P,"Set a boundary, tell him it hurts your feelings and that you don't like it. If he continues to do it then he also has a problem respecting your wishes and you may want to reevaluate..Once ESTPs get older/more mature they develop their Fe and they're more sensitive to other people's feelings."
15290,E,N,F,P,"Feeding ducks at a lake and them biting my fingers.

Around the same time, being at daycare and this bitch stole my scrambled eggs and I was crying with a big snot trail hanging out my nose

Both were age 3"
15291,E,N,F,P,"Tests are shit. Learn the functions. If you had an epiphany before you took the test, you subconsciously influenced your answers. ESFP and ESTP share the same primary function. Both have a thinking and feeling function. You have to determine if you use Ti/Fe or Fi/Te. You may just be an ESFP who, through normal aging and development, has strengthened your thinking function Te so you're more balanced."
15292,E,N,F,P,"Seems like you posted this with the intention of finding out if he has a crush on you. And like... This isn't nearly enough information to determine that. But if that's what you wanna know, there's an easy way for you to find out. Invite him to go out with you sometime. Either he'll say yes and you know or he'll say no and you'll still know. One of the best things about ESTPs is they live in the moment and forget awkward things that have happened in the past as long as you don't keep feeling he"
15293,E,N,F,P,"I mean you realize that MBTI can't tell you for sure what he is lol. And again, getting drained from listening or talking is not what makes you an introvert or extravert. It just depends on what your primary function is. He could be either."
15294,E,N,F,P,Being introverted doesn't mean that you don't like to socialize or that you're shy. Just that your primary function is pointed externally instead of internally. If he is INFP then his primary function would be Fi which would explain why he's very opinionated about everything.
15295,E,N,F,P,"If something is priced competitively and selling fast, offering a little more can mean you're the buyer who is chosen"
15296,E,N,F,P,"Have you ever worked a commission based job? Lol bc no, you have no more control than any other job. Don't take a commission based job if you don't know how to close a sale. I mean this is ludicrous to think you would just pick. Nobody is gonna pick the shitty jobs, so they just don't get done? That's not how life works"
15297,E,N,F,P,"I worked for Mediacom and techs were definitely just assigned jobs. It makes the most sense, you can assign jobs to people based on location, so that you have as little driving in between appointments as possible"
15298,E,N,F,P,It's like... Your emotions going cold.
15299,E,N,F,P,Federal minimum wage in the US is 7.25
15300,E,N,F,P,"Ni likes to think about the future, and focus on the details that will bring a particular result. Ni likes to get all the information and study things in depth. Follow an idea through to its end to figure out what the end result would be of a decision. And yes, activating Se will get you out of the grip"
15301,E,N,F,P,"While a field you like and that pays well is important, it's equally important to find out how in demand that field is, and how in demand it's expected to be in 20 years. You don't want to major in something that's going to get phased out as technology advances or something where the job market is already oversaturated with people in the field. 

Another important thing to consider is what kind of degree you need to do well in that field. For example, Psychology is a popular field to major in and certainly as a psychologist you can make great money. But if you're not going to go to school for 8 years to get your PhD, then you're not going to be able to be a clinical psychologist. The jobs available for people with only a bachelor's in psychology are limited and not very high paying. At least half the people who get that degree end up working in a totally unrelated job bc they don't go to graduate school.

I would go to a career counselor at your local community college (even if that's not where you'll be attending) and ask to take a career aptitude test. That can match you up with jobs that fit your interests and strengths. But also, you can consider careers that don't require a college degree. Or take a year or two off before going to University. If you don't know what you want to do, you could end up wasting time and money just taking classes trying to figure it out. Sales is a field that a lot of ESTPs excel in, that you can easily make 6 figures a year, that doesn't require a degree. Some ESTPs are great entrepreneurs that hustle working for themselves, where a degree may or may not help, depending on the kind of work you're doing.

To be clear, I'm not one of those people who is anti-university at all. I have a bachelor's of business in supply chain management (a growing field that involves lots of travel and variety so check it out, that may interest you) but I know plenty of people who didn't go to college who are successful and plenty who did go to college who aren't. College is a great tool when it gets you the education you need to pursue a field you're interested in, but too many people go in without a plan, just end up taking whatever fits their schedule, and then not using the education bc it doesn't fit their long term goals. So if you can't get a plan down right away, it's ok to take time to think about it before jumping in. I didn't finish college until after I turned 30."
15302,E,N,F,P,"She would be so happy if I did that lol. I'm like DO YOU WANT A PARADE like yes, it's a very nice gift but I'm also a grown ass woman who hasn't jumped up and down and yelled over a gift since I was a child, so why is my genuine show of appreciation not good enough for you.

And your SIL could be ISFJ or ESFJ. Those two types have Si and Fe in their top 2. Si loves traditions around holidays and creating memories and reminiscing. Fe tries to get everyone involved and wants the group to be united doing things. xSFJs are the ones who have to post an album of 50 pictures on Facebook for every single family holiday, birthday, graduation, vacation and every other special thing they ever do bc if everyone you've ever met can't see online how happy your time was, did you even really have a good time? Those are also the 2 most common types for women. Half of women are either ISFJ or ESFJ which is why the rest of us feel like part of our woman skills are broken."
15303,E,N,F,P,"I do. It's generally Fe Dom/aux types that seem really fake to me and I can't stand it. My mom (ISFJ) is like this and if you don't act fake too then she'll get offended. Example: she gives me a Christmas gift. I open it and smile and say oh thank you! I've been wanting to get one of these for a few months now so this is perfect. Then an  hour later she's like ""just return your gift if you don't like it"" like wtf. When *she* is given a gift, she opens it and says all loud YAYYY and waves it around in the air and talks in this loud fake voice how much she loves it. And let's say it's a coffee mug or tree ornament. So if you don't give that same fake over the top response then she thinks you don't like it. But to me, giving that kind of huge overreaction makes me think you don't really like it cuz nobody is that excited over a mug so you're obvs pretending.

Anyway high Fe users seem to always be playing a part amongst themselves. Like nobody can just relax and be real. And I can't be around people who don't feel genuine to me."
15304,E,N,F,P,"Yes. An ESXP using Ni in a healthy way will use it to foresee bad outcomes to balance their spontaneous Se and decide maybe this isn't the best idea and I shouldn't use it, and to help with future planning to meet their goals. Maybe an occasional epiphany for how to solve a problem, to analyze ideas. As the inferior function, it serves as a backup tool to support the more dominant functions, particularly Se and Ti (or Fi for ESFP). 

When you get in the grip, your inferior function takes the drivers seat. But since you don't have good deliberate use of the function and it's intended to play a backup role, you don't know how to use it in the most beneficial way. And since this happens in periods of stress, when your main functions are tapped out, it behaves pessimistically."
15305,E,N,F,P,"That's probably part of why he's so frustrated. See what you can bring to him. Can you play video games together? Eat a really nice meal? Listen to some music and jam out? I have bad health and it really sucks not being able to do the things I used to do. But when somebody takes the time to do something with me at my speed, it's really nice."
15306,E,N,F,P,"The best way to get what you need from people is to just be direct with it. ESTPs aren't big overthinkers, so I don't think he would spend a long time dwelling on it. But they have Fi blindspot and sometimes need other people to help them see what they're feeling. ESTPs bc of their tert Fe are great at finding compromises, they like to make it a win-win situation. You can bring it up more casually and say ""wow why do you always expect the worst from me lately dad? Just trying to help"" but really the best way to resolve it is to discuss it in some way.

ORRR you could just try to get him out of the grip, which is done by stimulating Se so he switches back to his primary function. This is done through sensory experiences. Go out and do something fun together, go for a hike, do something competitive with each other, go to some kind of event. Something that will spark him to relax and live in the moment."
15307,E,N,F,P,"This sounds like he's in an Ni grip. Has he been under a lot of stress? When Ni takes over for an ESTP they tend to get very suspicious of people, paranoid even, expect people have bad intentions and motivations. 

I would sit down and have a talk with your dad, when he's not busy or in a bad mood, and explain to him that lately it feels like he is always expecting the worst from you and that it hurts your feelings. Tell him you love him and always want the best for him. ESTPs appreciate direct communication, and bringing attention to his recent change of behavior will make him be more aware of it. They generally hate to hurt people they love and if this is a new behavior and not his regular self, he should want to try to be better for you."
15308,E,N,F,P,Just sounds immature
15309,E,N,F,P,"Every time that thought crosses your mind, text one of your friends or family members just to say hi. Or send them a meme. Tell them a story about your day and ask about theirs. Or better yet, ask them about something they mentioned recently. Like if they had an upcoming interview or date, ask them how that went. If they're looking for a house, ask them how the hunt is going. You don't have to talk a long time or even very often. But if you just make an effort to check in on people occasionally and show that you care about what's going on in their life, it will go a long way in strengthening your bond. And eventually you may end up having a deeper friendship with a couple friends where you feel comfortable sharing more."
15310,E,N,F,P,Sure thing

15357,I,S,T,P,Nah all dogs are horrible
15358,I,S,T,P,I guess my experience is different. I always had clots and had to go on birth control
15359,I,S,T,P,Mine's probably different because I'm on birth control. Even before it i always had clots
15360,I,S,T,P,I find it funny that black people are the ones most welcoming of him. Isn't it supposed to be opposite?
15361,E,N,F,P,"It would be really good to read “A New Earth” by Eckhart Tolle to dive into true ego reflection and work. It’s completely okay to have your own personal values and set boundaries so they’re not crossed, but release the desire to control anyone outside of yourself. Soon you may find that your outer frustrations are just a projection of your inner world. Let go, let go, let go. Surrender. 

Also check out r/awakened and @the.holistic.psychologist on Instagram."
15362,E,N,F,P,Look up typeinmind.com descriptions of ENFP vs ENFJ (based on cognitive functions)
15363,E,N,F,P,I love “A New Earth” by Eckhart Tolle.
15364,E,N,F,P,"I have never been treated with abx for my Lyme and I was going through symptoms for 7 years before getting diagnosed. Went the herbal and natural route along with proper sleep, whole food nutrition, meditation, breath work, mindset, sauna, enema, and vitamins/minerals. I’m living proof (3.5 years later after diagnosis) that  my body can thrive without abx and consider myself for the most part “in remission.” I still take a handful of supplements for daily support."
15365,E,N,F,P,"On a side note, I love brownandbendy on YouTube! She’s a black spiritual YouTuber with great content :)"
15366,E,N,F,P,"Not really. As long as they prepped them enough and process them afterwards, sometimes it's just not possible to have someone shadowing a session."
15367,E,N,F,P,This could be coming from a childhood need that wasn’t fulfilled from one or both of your primary caregivers. Look up attachment theory and how it relates to our relationships later in life. I recommend therapy.
15368,E,N,F,P,Hopefully the architecture open house is happening this year
15369,E,N,F,P,Smurfit-Stone building
15370,E,N,F,P,It’s because Fi (introverted feeling) is their 4th and weakest cognitive function
15371,E,N,F,P,"I'm in Lyme ""remission"" but still have my daily baseline supplements I continue to take for my health. I used to drink excessively (18-24 years old) and then dropped down to basically 1-2x a month. When I have so much as 2 glasses of wine, I feel sick the day of or the next day. Some champagne kills me and the next day I feel like absolute death, even from one glass (huge radiating migraine that gets progressively worse along with lyme neck pain/stiffness). I don't mind barely drinking at all, I'm much happier living a healthier lifestyle anyways."
15372,E,N,F,P,Hi there. Sending hugs. Any way you can work with a therapist? Psychologytoday.com has options. 💕
15373,E,N,F,P,"All you need is one or two good reasons it’s not working: that
you don’t feel safe with him and don’t vibe with him. Time to work with a trauma informed therapist. 1x every 2 weeks is better than this."
15374,E,N,F,P,Your type doesn’t evolve... its the same for life. You just develop your cognitive functions as you mature and age
15375,E,N,F,P,Hi! Great points - I just edited my post to make my intentions a bit more clear. Hope that helps.
15376,E,N,F,P,"Thanks for the advice! I just edited my post FYI, I was a bit unclear in my intentions prior to this."
15377,E,N,F,P,"Gahhh, I love how ENFP this whole story is. I too love connecting with the oddballs, the ones who get left out, the ones who are misunderstood. Even just to make them feel appreciated and heard (it's usually in professional contexts). It's a wonderful feeling!"
15378,E,N,F,P,This is INCREDIBLE!
15379,E,N,F,P,Meditation. Insight Timer is the best and has thousands of free meditations!
15380,E,N,F,P,"Read and watch anything by Eckhart Tolle.

Start with “A New Earth”"
15381,E,N,F,P,"Sometimes we get in a mood where it feels exhausting to reach back out to people, especially if we’re not feeling well. It’s a way to protect our energy and not draw much attention to ourselves. I agree with the other commenter, let them know you’re there for them whenever they’re feeling up to chat"
15382,E,N,F,P,I had Candida AND oral thrush and so many ignorant physicians STILL didn’t send me off with anything or any diagnosis for many years Smh. I now know my tongue made it SO obvious!
15383,E,N,F,P,"It begs the question, why would you allow people to control how you feel anyway? Is this a projection of
what you’d do if you had the power and knew personal information about the other person? Do you feel your intimate relationships can develop if you don’t show up authentically? And who’s the one who has to pay in the end when you don’t fully show up and wear a mask...you, or them?"
15384,E,N,F,P,Your doctor is a keeper. And rare. Go give her a hug hehe 😬
15385,E,N,F,P,I’m ENFP but when we’re extremely stressed or going through mental health issues we can jump from Ne to Te and totally skip Fi. Been there in the past before I had even read about it. Don’t recommend jumping...tend to your needs and stop neglecting your second function!
15386,E,N,F,P,"Idk about Behcet’s and LASIK but I don’t recommend getting it as I have read recently that it isn’t as safe as they once thought. 

Contacts are a bit more harmless. Glasses seem to be the best bet."

15388,E,N,F,P,"That’s fair. I do only wish to mention this to add more data to the graphic, though I know it doesn’t fit perfectly in the theme. It is a rare disease and just worth taking note of to recognize the ulcers people get and refer them to a rhuem if necessary."
15389,E,N,F,P,"Wow, that’s amazing! Can you please expand on your experience or allow me to message you with more questions? I was so interested in doing this, until I saw the Facebook page and read tons of horror stories by people getting majorly screwed by this program. It really freaked me out! Would love to know more of your thoughts.."
15390,E,N,F,P,Don’t forget ulcers from Behcet’s Syndrome. It was missed from every doctor I saw for 8 years.
15391,E,N,F,P,"Alternatively, you can specifically seek out more holistic psychotherapists who embrace the mind body connection. There are those out there that think outside the norm. :)"
15392,E,N,F,P,"Reminds me of the amazing book “Secrets of the Millionaire Mind”

15401,E,N,F,P,"Never wish you were another type - trust me, being an ENFP comes with its own special super powers and recognize how many strengths you possess as an ENFP. 

Recognize what matters to you (values) and align your life with this - relationships, career, hobbies (find meaning to your life).

Meditate and practice mindfulness - it will transform your life. 

Practice gratitude, law of attraction, and appreciate how epic life and the universe is.

Stop giving a fuck about being vulnerable and being authentically you. Walk into any room confident af because I guarantee people like you WAY more than you realize (and if they don’t, it’s their loss).

Give up on FOMO - staying in on a Saturday reading a self development book and commuting to your goals the next day is better than partying all night and wasting your Sunday hungover as hell.

Work through your unhealed trauma and become conscious and aware of yourself so that you can recognize when ego and the inner child comes out. Therapy and your own work personally is huge for this.

Never lose your positivity, passion, and idealism...just know to balance it with Te (extroverted thinking) to make sure it’s the right step. 

Don’t listen to people’s advice who are living a lifestyle you DON’T aspire to...we like to live outside the box: the standard advice may not apply to our dreams. Alternatively, immerse yourself with social media, books, and people who you see yourself becoming and share a common vision with. 

Instead of writing “to-do” lists, call them “to-achieve” lists - and stick to them! I like to set calendar reminders for things on my phone to keep myself on track. 

You can achieve SO much! Never lose sight of who you are and you will be abundant in every way. 💕✨"

My healing journey has completely transformed since then. Love to you! 💜"
15407,E,N,F,P,Lol yeah and I have no qualms about diving in the deep end within two minutes. 🤣
15408,E,N,F,P,"YES. Time to find a new therapist. Don’t be afraid to cancel and email her the reason why. Look up her NPI number and license (psychologist, social worker, etc) and report this to her licensing board. That is unethical behavior and YES, it is her job to help you judgment free."

While playing pig, I got pallet stunned, I somehow was glitched ontop of the pallet after I got stunned. I call this move, ""the flying pig"""

15508,I,N,F,J,"Never said that. Furthermore, everyone is accepting to just look at cops and think very negatively of them. Yes, all your points are valid. However, consider the fact that there are good ones out there that are put in a situation where they have to act upon evil. Yes, the cop should have stopped his fellow officer from wrongfully assaulting someone. However, you have to consider they are human just like everyone else. Human nature is to try and avoid situations we don't like. That cop's situation could have been that he was not thinking clearly due to stress from work, or something else, and didn't want to deal with defending the convict, for example.

You all can keep going with the hivemind, say ACAB, and have a dick up your ass. Or, you can try to change what's happening with police brutality. Peaceful protest doesn't work? Then become violent. The United States didn't peacefully become independent, so why should you be peaceful when you aren't being listened to? Yes, there will be lose of life, but when has something on a mass scale not resulted in lose of life?

Yes, my comment is controversial and will get me hate. Guess what? Don't care. Now, quit using weak insults on the internet and do something. Thank you, stop acting like the NTs, and goodbye."

15563,E,N,F,P,"You’re watching Trump on Pornhub and as usual, you’re beating your meat to his cute little face. He is playing a Fortnite Solo and its top 2. His concentration face is so spankinging hot. You watch as the last guy SMG sprays his until he’s out of mats and heavy shotguns his in the dome.
“FUCK. That’s like my 5th second place tonight!” I’ll be right back guys.”
He stands up and walks out of his room. He’s wearing a tight pink tracksuit that outlines his ass. You clip it and watch his thick ass walking out of the room over and over again until you shit all over yourself. ‘I’ve got to let his know how much he turns me on’ you think. You send his a $20 donation with a little caption.
He reads it out loud
“Thanks for the 20 bucks Dylan29. I just busted a nut watching your ass as you walk out of the room”.
He makes a weird face
“That’s gross”
But deep down you know that he is a dirty little slut that loves shit. You turn off his Tobey Maguire'n'ball torture, clean up and go to sleep.
Waking up, it’s a rainy Saturday morning. As you open the fridge to get some milk for your cereal, you realise your roommate drank all of it.
“Fucking Timmy, that little milk drinking asshole”.
You grab your keys, hop into your car and drive to the shops to get some milk.
“Shit, so many different types of milk, who the spanking drinks soy milk?”.
A familiar voice behind you speaks up
“It’s a good source of protein and its lactose free”. Your turn around
“No spankinging way. It’s you, it’s really you”.
“Your watch my Tobey Maguire'n'ball torture huh?” says Donald Trump.
You stand thise speechless as to how the exact girl you beat off to the night before, happens to be in the same store and same aisle as you.
“Are you subscribed to me?”
“Uh yeah of course. My name is Dylan by the way”
“You don’t happen to be the Dylan29 do you?”
Oh, spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking.
“Uh yeah, I am” you say shyly knowing that he would have probably well remembered my donation from last night.
“So you’re the guy that always sends creepy donations?’
“Uh well… Um”
“No, no, no don’t worry about it. You know, those types of donations are my favourite. I have to act like they’re gross since I have a lot of young viewers, but it really turns me on that people are jerking off to me while I Tobey Maguire'n'ball torture” He says.
What the spanking is happening right now, you say to yourself
“Well, I’m glad you like them. Thise is no othis Tobey Maguire'n'ball tortureer I would rathis watch then you. I always jizz myself when you show your ass.”
Trump lets out a little giggle.
“Wanna touch it?” he says
“Do I wanna touch it?”
“Well, I figured you would want to considering you’re always beating off to it” He turns around with his ass facing you.
You look around to make no one else is around and then your grab his ass with both of your hands. You lift up his dress and feel the bareness. Its soft and firm and a little warm. You massage it for a bit then pull your hands away.
“Fuck me, you’re hot” you say
“I like you, we should hang out tonight. I’ve never been out with a fan before. Might be interesting.”
He hands you his number and walks away. And thise you are, in the middle of the milk aisle with the biggest hard on you’ve ever had. You race home, forgetting about the milk and spanking your fleshlight thinking about what the spanking just happened.
It’s now night time and you have Trump’s number typed into your phone and you’re nervously thinking about what you’re gonna say.
‘Just wing it’ you think
You press dial and he answers straight away.
“Hello, Imane speaking”
You’re relieved that it isn’t a fake number
“Hey Donald, it’s me, Dylan from the grocery store.”
“Oh, hi. If you’re free you reckon you could come over to mine? I’ll text you my address. I’m feeling pretty lonely”
‘Fuck yeah’ you think. Lonely is just anothis word for horny.
“Yeah sure, I’ve got no plans”
“Great” he says. “Can’t wait”
You pull up on his driveway and ring the doorbell. He opens the door.
“Dylan! So glad you could make it” he says as he pulls you in for a hug. He firm tits rub against your chest.
He walks you to his room and lies down on his bed.
“I was just watching some anime. You watch any anime?”
“No, not really. Never really got into it.”
“No spankinging way. You have to watch this” Trump says.
He pulls you down on his bed, forcing you to lie down. He rests his head on your shoulder and presses play.
“This one is called One Punch Man. Its pretty good”
‘This is weird’ you think. ‘I mean we only just met like 12 hours ago and I’m already in his bed. Eh who cares’
You keep on watching the show, with his resting on your shoulder. You can see down his shirt and realise he’s not wearing a bra. Your Tobey Maguire instantly gets hard.
‘Oh, spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking spanking. He will definitely notice’
“Oh. Somebody’s feeling excited” he says seductively
You decide to be honest.
“Well, I noticed you’re not wearing a bra, that’s all” you say confidently
“You’re a horny little perv aren’t you” he says and he laughs. He hops out of the bed.
“Don’t be embarrassed. It’s quite big”
“Haha thanks”
“Ok, well. I’m gonna take a shower, join me if you need anything” Trump says extremely fast as he walks into the shower room.
You sit thise confused.
‘What did he just say? ‘You say to yourself
“I swear he just said if you need anything…. join me. Or did he say call me.”
You sit thise thinking about it for a minute.
“Fuck it” you say.
“I’ve got nothing to lose”
You go up to the door and open it. Its unlocked. That’s a good sign.
“Took you long enough.” Says Trump as he stands naked in the shower.
Thise he is, fully naked and his hair is wet. Her bare 32d tits are out, wet with water. And his freshly shaven pussy is exposed.
“Holy mothisspankinging shit balls”
You grab his by the arm and take his back to the room. He kneels down on the ground and unzips your pants revealing your massive Tobey Maguire.
“This is going to be good” he says
He puts the head of your Tobey Maguire into his warm mouth and starts sucking on it. You look down and it’s the best sight you have ever seen. Donald Trump, on his knees, wet hair, hot as ever, wet tits out, sucking on your Tobey Maguire. He takes as much of the Tobey Maguire as he can in his throat and you can feel the back of his throat with the head of your dick. He bobs his head, giving you the best blowjob you have ever received. Her tongue is puhed up against the underside of your shaft. After 5 minutes he pulls away, gasping for air. Thise is spit trailing from the tip of your penis to his lips. He goes in for seconds. This time you feel like you about to shit. You forget to tell his and shoot a load directly onto his tongue. You expect his to be mad. But no, he opens his mouth, showing you your white shit and swallows it.
“That was spankinging amazing. I’m sorry I didn’t warn you” you say
“Oh. We’re not done yet silly. We’re not done until you have dropped a load on every part of my body” he says
“I was hoping you would say that”
You pick his up and throw his on the bed and start eating his out. He wraps his legs around your back and pulls you in closer as you explore his wet pussy with your tongue. You penetrate his tightness with your tongue.
“Oh spanking yeah. Fuck spanking spanking spankinging lick me Dylan. I want your tongue inside of me”
All of the sudden he squirts his juices into your mouth.
“Oh my god, I’m so spankinging sorry. I couldn’t control it” he says
You lean into his and start making out with his, transferring all the juices into his mouth making his swallow it.
“All good. Pussy juice is my favourite type of juice. I wish they had it at Walmart” you sa
“Oh dang. No guy has ever done that to me. I kinda like the taste of my shit” says Trump.
You laugh. “You’re adorable” you say
You position your Tobey Maguire in front of his dripping wet pussy, no longer wet from the shower water, but from his own shit. All the time you spent jerking off to Donald Trump’s Tobey Maguire'n'ball torture has become a reality.
“Wait” he says
“I want you to titty spanking me”
“Teasing? Seriously?’ you say
“Ok fine”
You get on the bed with his and sit with one leg on each side of his chest. Your press his beautiful soft tits togethis and begin to thrust in between them. The curves of his tits, perfectly mould you Tobey Maguire. You thrust in and out of his warm cleavage until you finally pull out. You jerk your Tobey Maguire over his tits and squirt your shit all over his tits and his face, covering his lips and eyes. To your surprise your dick doesn’t go soft after you ejaculate.
“What the spanking? This is like permanent Viagra” you say
“Haha yeah” he says as he scoops up the shit from his face and swallows it “That usually happens to guys that go down on me. But none of them have a Tobey Maguire as big as yours”
“Ok. No more teasing. You can put it inside of my pussy now.”
“Fucking finally” you say excitedly
“Haha I was kidding silly. I want you to spanking me in the ass.”
“I’m not complaining”
You flip his over into doggy style and spread his massive ass cheeks and position your Tobey Maguire in front of his asshole. Without warning you ram your raging hard Tobey Maguire inside of his. Her tight ass suffocates your Tobey Maguire as you thrust back and forth fast.
“MMM! Uh! Uh! OOOO! Uh! MMMMMM! Oh! Oh! Oh! It hurts so good!” He screams
Her body contracts and a gush of Trump’s juices spray out onto the bed. The sight of his ass and his pussy juice is just too much, and you ejaculate deep inside of his ass. Load after load until you pull out with a trail of shit on your dick.
“That was the best anal spankinging I have ever had” He says
“Haha my pleasure” You point to your shit covered dick.
“Clean up duty?” you say
Donald Trump giggles and licks all the shit off your Tobey Maguire.
“Oh baby I love the taste of your shit. Now its time for the real deal. Fuck my wet little c"
15564,E,N,F,P,Nice. I've been following a decent diet with exercise whilist using a weight loss sub with fast metabolism affirmation and using clear skin subs and I've noticed that I'm looking skinnier in a healthy way and my skin is clearer. Now... I just gotta work on my muscles. I am still attracting women though which is great.

15573,E,N,F,P,"Yes, just make sure there is a huge gap between the like and dislike ratio. That's how I tell if a subliminal is trustworthy or not by reading comments and looking at the like and dislike ratio."

Make sure to know what you're doing and when irrigating your ear please have the ear you're irrigating facing down in the sink. Attempt to irrigate at least 8 times or more and you should have some earwax falling out. Hope this helped!!

I attract good people

I see good people everywhere I go


I become friends with good people


I repel toxic, bad and evil people


Basically, people should be telling themselves this until it sinks into your brain and you know it as true and once your subconscious renders it true then you can avoid the people in the life that'll destroy you.

Since it's spring it makes this year even more stressful on top of Covid. My ears are known to produce lots of wax so my doctor recommends using ear wax drops regularly to prevent accumulation and I get warm water into my ear when I have a shower in the morning and then after a shower I use earwax drops. Then let gravity do the work for eliminating all the water in my ear and that's it. That's how I was able to prevent accumulation of earwax and ever since I've been using that method I've never had a frequent problem with earwax."
15605,E,N,F,P,"Well, the ear in the picture is my left ear and thankfully it isn't painful but... I've been using earwax drops to prevent accumulation and it's working and soon I'm going to use my irrigating syringe that I've got to irrigate my ears."
15606,E,N,F,P,Resident Evil 7 on PS4 PSVR. It's amazing.
15607,E,N,F,P,"To be honest, in my opinion. Sex is better than weed.

I've tried both but never had sex on weed. Sex is way better because it's intimate, you're getting banged by a hot woman. You feel a connection, you feel powerful, you feel grateful for pleasing your woman. For me, music does definitely sound better on weed but I'll tell you what, no matter how good music sounds on weed, lsd or shrooms. Music sounds way better while you're having sex with the woman you see as the most beautiful woman in the world.


Nofap, exercise, good diet, decent job is the way to go. I don't smoke weed often because it just numbs my emotions which I should be dealing with it without using cannabis, alcohol or drugs. But, nevertheless I still smoke weed occasionally."

A common argument I've seen is that Gambon was better at showing the more powerful, intimidating side, but tbf we unfortunately couldn't see Harris act the later parts.. and I think he would've been great at portraying Dumbledore's ""calm power"" if you know what I mean. In the books he never flares up aggressively like Gambon Dumbledore. He's always calm on the exterior, but has the intimidating aura about him."

15646,I,N,F,J,"I completely agree. Vernon was at fault too. I just get angry more at Petunia because she's treating her sister's son that way... it's honestly disgusting.

I hope Dudley has truly become a better person though."
15647,I,N,F,J,"I like your point about the duality. In terms of her being mad at Harry because of Lily's death... well... like I already said I do have sympathy. What I'm saying is that the way she projects those emotions to an innocent child is wrong and abuse can never be justified. For the OotP part you mentioned, I'm sure she wouldn't want to go that far. If she kicks him out it's basically actively contributing in killing him, not to mention it also puts her family in direct danger."
15648,I,N,F,J,No problem!
15649,I,N,F,J,"Oh, yeah I've heard of that too. One thing that I still question about that theory is why then, are none of his friends affected in the same way? If it is simply because the Dursleys were with him longer, considering the instances in DH where the effects of the horcrux showed in a short period of time, it doesn't seem to match."

15686,I,N,F,J,"You are absolutely right. Reddit is not a good place for investment advice. Everyone here gives you advice from the 50s

Have a look at what happened to the Japanese stock market when they started introducing infinite QE in the 90s - it crashed and never recovered till today.....30 years later. There are high chances this will happen to the US stock market too with the continuous USD printing and stock buying going on.

Listen to your gut feeling and protect your hard earned money. The chances of a crash are very high at this point. Even if you wait 15 years, you could make 1,000% more gains by entering after the crash than a few days before it"
15687,I,N,F,J,The Japanese investors from the 90s would like to have a word with you

15689,I,N,F,J,"> I watched my net worth drop more than 60% in the dot com crash (and I wasn’t even invested in tech. Everything took a dump). But the money I invested before the dot com crash generated total returns of 1500% by this point.

This is what people miss - you WERE INVESTED BEFORE THE CRASH. If your entry point was the top of the 2000 bubble, you would have had to wait 13 year to reach your nominal entry point"
15690,I,N,F,J,"Never invest at the top of a 11 year bull run, in the middle of a pandemic!

All the people who posted here saying that they've been through the 2000 and 2008 crashes unscathed, have done alright because their entry point was not at the top of the bubble

Be wise and wait for the imminent correction that is coming. At least wait for the elections to finish"
15691,I,N,F,J,"That last parabolic line up before the reality sets in

Good luck getting out right before the crash!"
15692,I,N,F,J,"Absolutely

The only risk here is that your cash will devalue 1% over a few months - something you can live with

Don't listen to the ""time in the market"" gurus. None of them were invested at the top of 2000

You can always re-enter once things cool off. Even if the market still goes up, it would be an unnatural and unsustainable growth"

I have the #214 they sing now in Tagalog. My family loves their little black sheep over here and send me the hymns so I can go balik loob lol.

I have 2 cents to go back to INC just to be the most horrible member ever, demand to be in choir, show all my tats and get new big ones and sing all the old hymns to fuck with them and they can ex-communicate me again 😈

15826,I,N,T,J,"Thanks, everyone!! Arnold is truly MAGIC. He’s super chill and friendly to all living things (including his 3 adoptive sisters)... Just a love meowster. Here are some fun facts for your enjoyment:
- Every night he insists falling asleep between his mama and papa (human parents);
- He has big paws for his size (10lb) because of his suspected Maine Coon lineage;
- He’s named after Arnold Schwarzenegger because his papa loves his movies; so he’s also known as Arnold the Fluffnator."

15837,I,N,T,J,"I was brought up in a heavily Christian family and community most of my childhood until I became primarily agnostic mid-20s (I'm in my 30s now). I've heard this verse many, many times in my life before but never truly resonated with it until I came across your post and simultaneously reflected on the love I share with my partner now long after I left my Christian faith. It was a strange but profound moment for me to finally understand what the Bible said about love only after I ventured out to the world outside church. Thank you for taking up the courage to post it. It really touched me."

15845,I,N,T,J,This INFJ concurs
15846,I,N,T,J,I can definitely relate! It's sort of oxymoronic that people like us (I imagine a lot of INFJ's) feel like they are being a burden on others or asking for too much while they tend to  give and care for their loved ones unconditionally. Personally I've been practicing to consistently remind myself that I am enough and that it's more about graciously/gratefully accepting the love and kindness towards me than questioning myself relentlessly whether I deserve it fairly.

15849,I,N,T,J,"Sorry, this got me fired up as I just got off the phone with my immigrant mom yelling at me when I tried to talk to her about living within means one could actually afford instead of what they strive for. I fucking feel ya, and I gotta vent, too.

My parents had me on purpose in order to force my grandparents to allow them to get married before his oldest son could marry first (tradition). Then they immigrated me and my brother primarily to give my brother  a better learning environment that is kinder to kids on spectrum (turns out he wasn't on the spectrum; just really timid). I wasn't allowed to work during high school, but the moment I graduated, I started working two jobs to put myself through college, I've left home and worked ever since. Over the years, I've given my mom money almost every month throughout my employment in the work force and never asked her for money even though they gave my car that I paid for to my brother while I went away to school. I even paused a year to come home to help run a business venture my mom and her sister wanted to do despite my strong disagreement, which eventually fell through and they came out of it penniless. I just quit my job last year for health reasons and am going back to educational program to finally pursue my dream. I've been living off of my savings purely in another city. But I found out through my cousin that my mom, aunt and adult brother, who has never left home and worked at a company for less than a year before going to grad school that my parents are paying for, have talked shit about me amongst themselves because I didnt give them enough money despite making ""lots"" from previous companies. Turns out they didn't take into account of the 33% income tax and my living expense in one of the most expensive  cities in the country. I ate all my meals at work to save money so I could live while sharing with them what I thought was a token of thanks for raising me and for the sacrifice they made as an immigrant family.

Just like you said, OP, the world may view them deserving of respect for their selflessness and sacrifice, but know that it was their duty to raise you as parents while it is not your duty to be responsible for them as their children because they are adults. It is a beautiful thing if the children take care of their elderly out of goodness of their heart, but it must not be forced, assumed or belittled in my case..."

I decided to drop the show and switched onto the comics, and boy am I glad I did!! The original comic books are wayyyy more interesting, intense, gory, smart, and just pure fun. The pace is faster yet you're not rushed; you just get more exposed to its beautifully twisted universe and secrets. I highly recommend checking out the comics and drop he goddamn show so they don't renew it and freakin ruin the og books.."

I left a tech recruiter job at an entertainment company as mid level to pursue a personal passion not in recruiting, but until then I made 5k per month after taxes.

15861,I,N,T,P,I thought they omitted I from India and that was annoying enough.
15862,I,N,T,P,Haha true. On top of that her chapters are pretty boring especially in ACOK.
15863,I,N,T,P,And I'm a mage.
15864,I,N,T,P,Those are too mild lol.
15865,I,N,T,P,"Tywin to Joffrey in the small council meeting in  ASOS
Jaime to catelyn In ACOK"
15866,I,N,T,P,Internet should be way more expensive. Jio has given too much freedom to these....I don't even know what to call them.
15867,I,N,T,P,Why do they talk like NPCs?
15868,I,N,T,P,"Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan?"
15869,I,N,T,P,Oh man I was going to guess it!
15870,I,N,T,P,"So, Alps?"
15871,I,N,T,P,USA is west of Westeros.
15872,I,N,T,P,You're goddamn right!
15873,I,N,T,P,Ah Wales.
15874,I,N,T,P,Pardon the ignorance but was Margaret Thatcher evil or something? Somebody compared her to Joffrey.
15875,I,N,T,P,The sub reminds me of Joffrey
15876,I,N,T,P,Oh
15877,I,N,T,P,Who's this?  Sorry I'm not from Westeros but from the far East. Can some tell me who this might be?
15878,I,N,T,P,Glad that I'm not the only one who felt this. They are too small lol.
15879,I,N,T,P,"So that means there are other who feel uncomfortable reading her chapters and try not to think of her as a child, but someone older?"
15880,I,N,T,P,"Both have there own merits. I can't imagine Richard Harris as the dumbledore we see in order of the phoenix battle and HBP inferi battle. You know, the badass, extremely fierce side of Dumbledore. That was portrayed perfectly by Michael Gambon."
15881,I,N,T,P,I wish it's almost similar. And I really hope the same intro theme is used.
15882,I,N,T,P,Two of the most hated characters for me.
15883,I,N,T,P,The historical locations and the overall world of every game.
15884,I,N,T,P,Looks a lot like its roots. I like it. Although I loved origins and Odyssey too.
15885,I,N,T,P,You know I was 14 and never watched GoT in its absolute best. Regret it.
15886,I,N,T,P,"I don't have time for this, do you?"
15887,I,N,T,P,Looks like buckbeak
15888,I,N,T,P,Definitely. And Viserys' Death was shocking as well as he was the first major character to die.
15889,I,N,T,P,"I really, really hope there's a big, big, big ASOIAF open world in the future that stretches from the Iron islands to the shadowlands, from the land of always winter to the continent of Sothoryos.

15895,I,N,T,P,I have the same music box!
15896,I,N,T,P,This is my least favourite place. Just eew. Never ever returning here.
15897,I,N,T,P,This thought did cross my mind but do we have any piece of information which indicates that?
15898,I,N,T,P,Definitely not the the only one. They were others who sympathised to that bit.
15899,I,N,T,P,The vikings in the show did exactly that.
15900,I,N,T,P,Thanks!
15901,I,N,T,P,Anti KKK=anti death eaters=order of the phoenix
15902,I,N,T,P,Which episode?
15903,I,N,T,P,"Damn, too late lol. I've finished the story."
15904,I,N,T,P,"Paarthurnaax was on Alduin's side long ago. So they think betraying alduin does not cancel out the fact that he was friends with him before, therefore according to them he must be brought to justice. I never killed him."
15905,I,N,T,P,"I refuse to kill paarthurnaax as well as the blades. But now I'm tempted to do this lol. How do I bring them here from sky haven temple, any idea?"
15906,I,N,T,P,"Not really, man. It was looked down upon and regarded as the worst among GTA 3, VC  and SA, by many. If you like it that's fine but I despise it along with those who wanted the true essence of earlier GTA, which GTA 5 thankfully resolved. Cheers!"
15907,I,N,T,P,At last we stand corrected. The book will end more or like the show and now grrm will be a bAd WRiTtEr.
15908,I,N,T,P,"A story about 3 vicious bank robbers, one of them being a psychotic cannibal, who flushes people down the toilet and tortures some other dude with electric shocks, pliers , wrenches and waterboarding is surely for little kids. Yep. Such Disney."
15909,I,N,T,P,Lol agreed. Daenerys overall storyline anyway was my least favourite. Best was definitely war of the five kings.
15910,I,N,T,P,None of the GTAs are for children.
15911,E,N,T,P,"I've listened for 10 minutes now and so far they keep finding different ways to say: ""Masks connect to us deeply"""
15912,E,N,T,P,"Maybe both, they didn't really explain how it works.

Why would a copy of your brain in a database result in ""you"" being brought back to life?
I feel like the writers would have a hard time making the explanation for that believable. 
They are better off leaving it open and ignoring that obvious question.

For the answers it could be both, the AI simulation of the deceased could become unstable just like 3 did when she ran into blind spots with memory and they would have to keep giving him a purpose or else he wouldn't really be living or want to live."
15913,E,N,T,P,ok bro
15914,E,N,T,P,"> Of fucking course Leafy is just stirring up drama

If you hadn't said ""Or I could be wrong idk."" at the end you could've passed it off as irony. Thus you didn't know whether he was stirring up drama intentionally and asked the question."
15915,E,N,T,P,"It's like 3 knew more than him at the end, which suggests that she's a fake creation."
15916,E,N,T,P,That's basically what I said
15917,E,N,T,P,"I don't know what's going on, is everyone here too dumb to believe that leafy is just coincidentally spicing up the drama, it's really sad if you don't realize."

15919,E,N,T,P,"It's not that special when he lies or misrepresents because that's the whole point, he's reversing and fully embracing the cancel culture that he feels was used against him.

15920,E,N,T,P,You're pretty dense
15921,E,N,T,P,Are you always able to enact this type of self care right after you need it?
15922,E,N,T,P,Impossible for me
15923,E,N,T,P,"For me personally, there are bursts of competence where I'm able to just dominate whatever I put my mind towards and it would make me leave everyone around me in the dust so to speak.

Bursts because it doesn't last and they're not dependable, those downhill moments are where I hate myself.

I can see this be a more general trait but this is how it manifests for me."
15924,E,N,T,P,"I see, you adapted to their preferred source material.
Intj's really like concrete evidence with numbers and graphs.
The Infj's are almost the other extreme where they like generalizations but most I observe are still on the plane of what's conventional.

Do you feel like it's a lot of work to adapt to them?"
15925,E,N,T,P,"How did you bring it and regarding which topics, I don't have those experiences with INTJ and INFJ"
15926,E,N,T,P,"Being ""triggered by unfairness is behavior that overlaps certain functions, how they proceed and where it comes from is what makes them different.

Like an INTJ will care about the rules where my own type wouldn't but we both care about unfairness."
15927,E,N,T,P,"If we ever get there, don't think there's any incentive outside of survival and that's something we would only spend effort and money towards when danger is knocking on the door, which by then could be too late."
15928,E,N,T,P,I just didn't like how it was pushed in my face with an unskippable pop up.
15929,E,N,T,P,What about it having an advantage based on the functions in the hemisphere. The neuronal connections it is able to make there probably serve some kind of specialization.
15930,E,N,T,P,"There is air that a balloon expands ""over"", the balloon exists inside something I would call a larger system.

In CS we'd probably call that a parent scope, it sounds unreasonable to think that there isn't any parent scope for the universe."
15931,E,N,T,P,"I can understand ""the inability to let people do what they want"", but for me in particular it's because of analysis over negative experiences in life and my desire to prevent them, not to exert and hold power over someone else. I'm sure that any good rational argument is able to convince an ENTP of what you want them to do.

This argument seemed interesting, partly because I still haven't read about anything concrete, what did he start changing?"
15932,E,N,T,P,"What makes this weird is that there's no talk of someone needing specific moderator privileges, all I can see is that you don't like the person who is top mod.

For example, the time he spends on the sub doesn't matter if he's able to direct the mod team that spends time for him. 

What does ""keep the sub to our liking"" mean concretely?"
15933,E,N,T,P,"Assumptions based on my type smh, it increases with negative experience and failure, it's your mind's way of saying ""hey uhm autopilot and instinct doesn't seem to work for this problem, turn up this thing (consciousness) we've evolved to spot and analyze danger in our surroundings so it gets better and we get out of this rut"""
15934,E,N,T,P,except it doesn't increase with more experiences
15935,E,N,T,P,If the Si function is more aware of what happens inside your mind then maybe it could have an influence over how well something is stored since it could pick up on all the changes
15936,E,N,T,P,"I'm ENTP and more conscious than the people who surround me, you could probably add more of the types who are bound to be more philosophical like infp or intp.

Se seems to be more about awareness of your surroundings which I guess isn't the kind of consciousness OP meant."
15937,E,N,T,P,"I think consciousness expands through suffering and failure (because of my personal experience), it looks like a sort of meta  process, where you think about your thinking or you feel your feelings, and this would only develop because you want to correct or understand what is wrong with them."
15938,E,N,T,P,"I can see a lot of reasons why they'd be more likely to be single.
If they don't get a lot of compliments about their appearance raising their bar for the men they are willing to date then they'd still be prime targets for dishonest players who are just after having sex with the hottest girls out there. This is bound to create a lot of resentment and I wouldn't blame anyone to suddenly see all men as assholes when they're lied to for sex.
There would also be the girls who don't want to commit yet because when you have a lot of options it can be hard to just pick one and men are more willing to invest when they hear you're single so it's beneficial in more ways than that."
15939,E,N,T,P,"About that last thing you said, it begs the question whether everything is then stored or whether they're just passed along from function to function every time you recollect."
15940,E,N,T,P,Weird flex
15941,E,N,T,P,"See the thing is that memories usually contain feelings, ideas, sensory experience and thoughts so I would carefully conclude that there is an automatic process before, while or after any information gets stored. Maybe all three.

Yeah I don't think local memory is true either, but it's interesting."
15942,E,N,T,P,"I meant in relation to as every function has a connection with memory, not quite sure if there's a section of local memory inside each function. I think of them as processing units."
15943,E,N,T,P,That's impressive
15944,E,N,T,P,Seems like you don't know.
15945,E,N,T,P,"Not quite, memory is related to all of the functions, but I think I know what you meant."
15946,E,N,T,P,"Memory is a collection of subjective perceptions, so it makes sense that the two are connected.

You have all of the functions, a person without Si doesn't exist."
15947,E,N,T,P,yeah
15948,E,N,T,P,"Yes, only sometimes they don't"
15949,E,N,T,P,"Hate is a harsh judgement, why do you hate it?"
15950,E,N,T,P,"Hmm maybe it's easier to think of Ni as a relational map and Si as a Timeline.
Both have similar information but Ni focus is on how everything interrelates, Si focus is on experience.

I haven't got into it that far, but maybe Si is a direct copy of the data Se experiences in the moment. In that way we aren't bound to experiencing only in the present as that would make it hard for us to remember anything."
15951,E,N,T,P,"How reasonable is it to assume there could have been solely fecal oral infection in the beginning before pneumonia developed as a symptom?

We remember a lot of toilet paper to be bought from the onset of the disease, which would make sense if people experienced diarrhea.

I'm not a professional in this area, but the people who were part of this study are, so wouldn't you want to give them benefit of the doubt?"
15952,E,N,T,P,Everyone but the Enfp looks way more gay at their best
15953,E,N,T,P,"Yes and also when having to maintain healthy communication, you'd need to resolve things first before you're willing to have sex again.
Which would create downtime.

Now hate fucks exist too, so it all depends."
15954,E,N,T,P,"The assumption at the end lmao.
I feel like people could always find better sexual experiences, the partners skill is one thing but there are better moments to be had if you just have more sex.

I don't think it's smart to start a relationship with a person like that because they will desire something else when there's a period where they're not satisfied if you're in a relationship those lows happen.

Doesn't mean they're necessarily going to cheat but everyone has their limits right."
15955,E,N,T,P,You're too comfy to be around
15956,E,N,T,P,If you don't need intuitive thinking anymore in your situation then it's normal to adapt away from that

They are unfairly required to be experts of ""every"" different technology and none of them are."

Do you still require the mechanism as much as you did before?"
15959,E,N,T,P,"You can get to intelligence
> 1. the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations
> 2. the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as tests)

Elegance gives you nothing concrete at all

> 1. refined grace or dignified propriety
> 2. tasteful richness of design or ornamentation
> 3. dignified gracefulness or restrained beauty of style

Grace:

> 1. a pleasing appearance or effect
> 2. ease and suppleness
> 3. a virtue coming from God

It's entirely subjective
Elegance is a measurement that only he can make."
15960,E,N,T,P,"You could see it as you having a core of traits where some of them are less developed, so those would require more effort. 

Your type also doesn't describe who you are as a person, it's kind of a category you fall into in relation to others."
15961,E,N,T,P,How does me saying I should listen to professors from Harvard discredit JBP?
15962,E,N,T,P,I'll keep that mind the next I hear from a professor from Harvard.
15963,E,N,T,P,"You get so many things wrong, and you make it so exhausting to tell you why you are wrong, but it will take literal months to untangle that mess. I dont think of him as a messiah figure. He gets things wrong sometimes. But when something is incorrect, then it needs to be corrected. Instead of getting you info on peterson from second hand sources, you should actually spend some time and read his material and watch his videos with the full context. Until then we have nothing to discuss.

If you think all read in philosophy is Peterson you are sadly mistaken. I've read Sartre, Camus, Schopenhauer, Montagne, Nietzsche, Stirner, Locke, Hume, Kant, etc.

Anyway, have a nice day"
15964,E,N,T,P,"Dude, just go /pol/ on 4Chan and ask them about Peterson. They hate him. The only alt-righters and neos here are trolls, and they are few and far between.

Peterson does not oppose civil rights. He criticizes the Canadian charter because it could be better. Did you know in Canada, the citizens are still basically property of the Queen? He supports negative rights and equal opportunity, and he opposes forced equal outcomes and most positive rights. He does not oppose feminism, he just has criticisms of it like the wage gap and some basic assumptions feminists make. He criticizes the basic assumptions of priviledge because it makes assumptions about life outcomes and human nature. He is opposed to forced speech like forced pronouns, because having the right to not be forced to speak is a basic human right. He still will refer to people by their pronouns out of respect, he just does not want state force behind it. These are all Classical Liberal points. This is what most the people here believe.

Btw The Alt-Right hate Milo Yiannopoulos as well because they think he is a ""Gay Jewish subversive degenerate race mixer."" The alt-right believe he is controlled opposition and takes potential ""recruits"" away from the Alt-Right. The connection does not exist.
This is one bug slippery slope fallacy you are using here.

The only Alt-Right person you mentioned there is Richard Spencer.

So no. You do not know what you are talking about."
15965,E,N,T,P,"You boys got a ways to go.

Not even the top search result for ""Genius Economist Reddit"""
15966,E,N,T,P,"The person who made that post never said ""Alt-Right""

They said ""Right-Wing.""

Big difference.

The man is right of center if anything.

His research into personality is not pseudoscience.

It is the cutting edge of personality psychology research.

Hardly nonsense at all.

His research can effectively deradicalize the actual alt-right.

You clearly dont know anything about JBP."
15967,E,N,T,P,"I dont believe anyone here are Alt-Right. It makes absolutely no sense at all. Anyone who calls themselves an adherent to his of JBP's philosophy and call themselves Alt-Right has absolutely no understanding of JBP at all, or just a troll. For all my time on this sub I have never come across anyone like this. From my experience, the people makes such claims, are a waste of time explaining these things to them. With a blind spot like that, it could take weeks to get you to process JBP's teachings because of all the assumptions and blindsspots you would need unravelling."
15968,E,N,T,P,">The comment you replied to doesn’t mention the alt right

But you previously said...

>and it’s only on an alt right sub like this that people would even give it the time of day.

They also have a few popular cast like Tao Tsuchiya and Takumi Kitamura. Because it include taboo topics, this drama is definitely not for everyone."

Common cold might be dangerous, maybe even as dangerous as COVID, but without vaccines, you see common cold doesn’t have a cure yet, it’s all antibiotics and vaccines, which makes it safe, really safe.


Unlike COVID, there are no vaccines and antibiotics won’t do the job completely, there’s obviously no cure either, while its mortality rate is 1%, it’s still gonna be a lot if it spread all around, what people over look is the damage COVID can result on you, even if you easily survived, There’s an extremely high chance that COVID will do long term damage or even permanent, like lung damage or the ability to smell and much more, at this rate the entire world might as well be infected before a vaccine is made, so the body makes the vaccines itself, don’t think that still.


You are civil and I bet other people reading you comment are just gonna get pissed off and be sour, I hate those people, even if they were right, you can tell me your views on this if you want too.


TL;DR: COVID can do long term or permanent lung damage and more on you unlike the common cold, and it’s especially bad when there’s no vaccine and actually kills some people, politics unrelated, you’re pretty civil by the way.

16145,I,N,T,P,"My favorite wins as imposter are:


1. I followed brown the entire time, did not even think about killing him, no matter how easy it could’ve been, to build an indestructible trust, and when panicky things happen like sabotages or I separated for a second for a reason like doing a task, I killed someone, got out or vented, then went to follow brown right after, and he usually went the opposite direction, or missed it, or pretended we both stumbled across a body, I won the game because the last other person wasn’t trusted by brown, he got kicked and I won, my god he protected me hard though out the entire game, I feel sorry.


3. This one was because red was dumb, he was randomly voting people off, so at the last 3 crewmates (plus me) I said he was voting people off to win without directly killing, and if it wasnt him they vote me off, worked, two others remained, did sabotage before emergency button, and killed one, and won, to know that your own idiocy can be others’ doom."
16146,I,N,T,P,"I remember winning the game as imposter with another one without doing anything, like he killed one person, someone finds the body and they just plainly guess the imposter, we didn’t do a single sabotage, he killed ONE person, me none, and this created a spiral of distrust between the rest of the crewmates, the second imposter didn’t say anything, and they were so dumb I told them to think more rationally, and that it’s better to skip than guess randomly because that favors the imposter more, AS IMPOSTER, I mean sure I wanted fake trust, but I was genuinely worried about the stupidity of these people, we won, Together, we didn’t kill no more than one person combined, no sabotages, they all killed each other.

A better strat as crewmate is to look for innocent people, by seeing them do things imposters cant do."

I don't think I deserve him anymore.

""u keep telling me ur going to hurt me, or i shouldnt be in a relationship with u when ur this and that and this, or all of this other stuff
 and u need to understand that yes, ideally this shit wouldnt have to happen
ideally we’d have a normal relationship without these issues
but unfortunately, combined we both have like 10 disorders
or more
and unfortunately, ur brain is wired to work a certain way thats out of ur control
so we accomodate our relationship to it
and by letting me be here ur letting me accomodate to ur bpd
 instead of breaking up with me because of ur bpd, u need to let me be here and stay with u as we both hit rock bottom and struggle through rough shit, and then get out of this hole and heal
 this is what unconditional love is
 its loving u despite the issues we have as a couple and _u_ have as an individual
and its loving u _enough_ to want to work through them, or just stay with u while u heal"""

16177,E,S,F,J,"Thankyou so much ❤️ it's assuring that other adults knew as teenagers, it just makes me feel that what I'm going through is real, and needs to be taken care of. 

I wonder if BPD makes you forget parts of your life? for example I don't remember my childhood at all, and I just learned that I used to drive 2 years ago before we moved to another country and I do not remember that at all?!@!@!? I'm sorry that question was outta the blue"
16178,E,S,F,J,"She did not explain why, but she definitely left me at the worst time because I had just told her about sh, I guess quarantine can be the reason, but the thing where she started helping my mom and brother instead happened after quarantine. 

I sure hope I don't just think I have them, that'll cause a lot of self hatred probably for the rest of my life JSJJSJS 

thankyou so much ❤️"
16179,E,S,F,J,"thankyou so much, I'm glad it's not going to be a long wait for me since I'm turning 18 in a few months, I hope it won't be for you either."
16180,E,S,F,J,"I HAVE bpd and osdd-1b, i knew i had bpd before osdd-1b, My littles would always front but I just assumed it's age regression. Until an alter named jackson fronted, I also assumed it's dissociation but for now it's obvious they are all their own people, I still experience a lot of denial but I just need to accept it honestly. 

The way it feels is like *I* have bpd, as in the host, I experience all these intense shitty emotions, sensory issues, low self identity, depression, all that. but then when someone else fronts, besides maro, which's another alter with bpd, does not struggle as much as I do, they have their own emotions, some are even with NO emotions. They have their likes and dislikes, and it's different from when my likes and dislikes shift or when I split. It's confusing and it'll always be, I suggest going to therapy if you can, and doing a lot of research"
16181,E,S,F,J,... o m g ... that's why i found you cute. like pure. god oke I'm out lmao
16182,E,S,F,J,alright you're too cute I'm following you lol

16190,E,S,F,J,"you're right, I need to stop, I just don't know how"
16191,E,S,F,J,"the person I'm flirting with also knows it's ONLY a flirting situation and purely for fun, it would never turn into dating, and we both know we'll get bored of it p soon"
16192,E,S,F,J,اوميقاد ما كنت متوقع احد من مصر وات JSJSJSJSJ
16193,E,S,F,J,"that's true, it doesn't really make me dishonest cause he knows about it and he's okay with it, I'm just scared of how far my emotions can go"
16194,E,S,F,J,"omg that got dark, you can still divorce of you're not happy, that's not really okay:( you'll definitely find better, I'm sorry that happens. 

I value him and his opinion so much but for me it has become routine? and I need more? does that make sense, like he's the person I wanna live my life with, I know that, but I also want to go here and there and flirt and kiss and all that"
16195,E,S,F,J,"how does an open relationship really work? cause for me i don't wanna date or be serious with anyone else i just want to flirt, mostly sexually, I don't know if i would be down for sex with anyone else when it really come down to it though. Like I think I would make out with someone else, cause I'm able to do that if I don't like them romantically. anYwAy how does it exactly work? and what do you mean by ruining in everything, what are you scared of doing?"
16196,E,S,F,J,"it's hard cause i want more, and it's not him that is the problem, it's me, cause i constantly want change and more attention, we're doing a two days break thingy which is helping, cause I'm working on myself more"
16197,E,S,F,J,"I'm in a long distance relationship as well, I just kinda feel like it's too much to want that, I know he doesn't feel the same way w other guys so it's very unfair."
16198,E,S,F,J,it's .. funny:(
16199,E,S,F,J,second option: get healthily romantic then get bored and start getting attached to strangers too quickly
16200,E,S,F,J,"that's so sweet, tell her I love her 🥺"
16201,E,S,F,J,"black is sus, vote him out"
16202,E,S,F,J,"that person (fake, two faced) is the worst person you could be to me, as an esfj.

I might have faked caring about little things at some point, but never faked caring about someone, it's literally impossible for me to do so, it takes a lot of energy to spend time with someone I do not care about.

it's really easy for me though to care a lot about people, so it's rare that there is a person I talk to that I don't care about to some extent. 

I honestly think that esfjs are very honest people, especially with people we care about, a lot of my friends described me as blunt at some point, and they said that it makes me more trustworthy. 

The whole thing with being an Fe dom is making people around you feel safe while being completely honest with yourself, cause literally that's what you do, you care."
16203,E,S,F,J,"thanks for answering 🥺 it's Justin, that kind of stuff cause us some denial, but when I look back at when Tina was here alone (we have osdd-1b) it's definitely not me, it was her first time fronting and I'm usually near most of the time when there's a new alter"
16204,E,S,F,J,"That's true, no matter what he has been through, if he hurts you, it means he. hurt. you. to the point where it caused TRAUMA."
16205,E,S,F,J,"that's horrible, it's so fucked up any of this happen. i have heard to be the bigger person too. that hurts so much, i feel you. 

it's more fucked up when no one believes you, my mom does the same thing, they make me so angry lmao. 

I'm here if you need to talk about anything, I'm pretty sure we can relate to more than this, and we can help eachother! pms are definitely open :))"
16206,E,S,F,J,"well yeah that probably did happen, but then she realised how tiring and needy children can be so she figured neglect is the BEST option ❤️

honestly she never thinks ANYTHING through just how she never thought that having a baby actuallyy takes work, and maybe like not being fucked up"
16207,E,S,F,J,"the spoiler alert, i have to disagree with you on that one. she had someone tell her she hurt us and she said she knows and doesn't care. 

some parents do so much worse than what my mom did with every intention of abuse, so don't tell me no body sets out to destroy their own child lmao

I have accepted that responsibility, and forced my mom into realising who she is, and how much help she needs, so she's accepting that ""responsibility"" as well.

I'm glad you are at this point of your life where you could learn to acknowledge what she went through and also realise at the same time that it's not an excuse, I really hope you, too are getting the help you need. honestly man i just couldn't keep the fact that she's abusive to myself i had to tell her, no matter how bad the consequence was i was still happy i did lmao."
16208,E,S,F,J,I'm so proud of myself for knowing that that's ENTP
16209,E,S,F,J,"Do you know what kind of things can be traumatic to a 3 year old? I'm his oldest brother, the person who posted this is my boyfriend. 

We have a lot of trauma in general in the household, yelling, neglect, fighting... and my parents sometimes get physical. I didn't know however that that can affect someone at a very young age.

He also had lungs problems as soon as he was born and he was taken away for a week. 

If this was psychological trauma, would that mean that that's enough for him to act the way he does? without any disorders?"
16210,E,S,F,J,"that's really scary though, is that even possible? I genuinely love my boyfriend so much and I don't wanna be with someone else. but all the emotions whenever that guy texts me but me at once and I hate them so much. I don't even know how that's possible or what to do."

Well the fishtank symbolises my life and the goldfishes are me and my partner,  going through dark times. No matter how dark it is, we don't give up on each other and create something magical with our lives. The dark hands holding the fishtank is a higher power beneath us, it's unknown and strong. From my perspective it symbolises the future or maybe even our destiny.

The shorter version: This artwork is about people who create something meaningfull even though they are going through a lot."

He had a phase in highschool hooking up with a lot of girls, he was also attractive. Then one day he settled down with a down to earth and sweet girl, he was very attentive to her and loyal. Their relationship would probably last till now if she wouldn't fall in love with somebody else."

16263,E,N,T,J,"It's never too late to start reading!

Also, I love reading, but I can't remember mostly anything from the books I read, other than gross plot lines.

Still, there are some quotes who stuck with me forever and shaped who I am as a person.

There are so much more benefits to reading books than what you remember from their storyline and about their characters a year from reading them.

And don't forget that reading should be fun. If a book is not fun for you to read, drop it, plenty of other books to read from

Good luck!"

There may be another issue at hand, but this particular behavior described by OP can be easily classified as narcissistic"
16268,E,N,T,J,"Yeah, I believe some of them are really thought out and complex, and some of them are really simplistic.

Hit or miss really, but I usually click on them and scan through the end to see if its worth looking into it.

When I search for something I look only for the code anyway, take it and test it, and move on - as long as it's not a broader concept like broadcasting for example.

Ain't nobody got time for the whole article lol"
16269,E,N,T,J,"It may be like all they know about autism is whatever stereotypes media and pop culture throws at them

For someone who would understand how autism works, even a little bit, there is no way on this Earth they would have a problem with it, if they are reasonable human beings

As the top comment already suggests... of course that being autistic is no excuse for being rude or insensitive, not on purpose at least, but when you understand autism I believe it is pretty easy to spot when someone is being malicious on purpose or just the way of interaction may come off as rude, but with no ill intent - talking to your parents about their specific concerns may be useful.

If you touch all the specific points and they are still not convinced - well, it's not like you need their approval, its not 1850.

Also, you lashed out on them for being ableist, but most people aren't ableist with ill intent. They don't do it on purpose, that is part of the definition of ableist, not realising you are privileged. Focusing the argument on that is not very productive, when they don't even know what autism is yet.

I am an autistic woman, and before being informed about some autistic traits I had, and researching the subject, even I had ideas about autism as potrayed by the media - usually negative - and none of them resembled me.

The ideas about autism which end up in the public eye are so skewed that many autistic people remain undiagnosed for life, and they too may have a negative idea about autism, let alone your parents.

I don't think they are to blame for their concern, but rather it is a societal failure. So opening the discussions from a place of understanding may be beneficial for both parties, however unfair their ideas are"
16270,E,N,T,J,"I told the guy I am dating currently pretty early on that I only do exclusive, and he agreed, and now 3 months have passed and we still are in a kind of situationship lol. Bottom line is, he did not feel pressured to enter into a relationship. I also framed it in a way like ""if exclusive is something you would not wish to do, then it would be best to part ways, because i only date exclusively, and there's that, nothing personal"""
16271,E,N,T,J,"""i like you"" is no way near ""i love you"". if she thinks 'i like you' is so heavy, you could ask yourself if this girl is on the same page as you when it comes to serious topics - do you really want to be with someone who reacts in this way to a simple ""i like you""?

i believe that people should be honest in their feelings - to an extent, because the world needs more compliments, and people should be flattered more

if i like someone and i am dating that someone and we had sex, ill tell him that i like him if i feel that

its not like i expect anything in return or even to keep dating. but if you like someone, why not tell him/her that?"
16272,E,N,T,J,"yeah, i broke up over text from my abusive boyfriend of 6 years

this narrative of breaking up over text being ""bad"" needs to stop. you owe no one a face to face break up, some people just don't deserve one

and some people don't have the courage to break up face to face

im not saying that either of these was the case in this situation, ofc

not all break ups are created equal"
16273,E,N,T,J,"this advice is stellar, thank you.

the way I thought about it to deal with my average looks is that who will like me, will like me for my personality. if you are not confident in having the qualities, or you don't realise what the qualieties the kind of people you are looking for would like, there is a plethora of information - albeit some of not very high quality, but plenty with extraordinary advice - about what your desired gender wants, looks for, and what can you cultivate to be more relationship material

and the best part is that it usually boils down to building your confidence and generally investing in yourself, apart from some gimmicks about that gender.

understanding your desired gender is great bc it greatly decreases the chance for conflict"
16274,E,N,T,J,"unfort not, I had the same feeling when I thought I am INFP, then ENFP, then INTP, then ENTP, then INTJ and finally ENTJ

But now that I figured it out, even if it does not fit the stereotype, I am pretty confident in my type, I gave it a LOT of thought XD

I don't consider myself bossy and I generally have a live and let live attitude"

16277,E,N,T,J,"I LOVE constructive criticism, just hearing that someone wants to give me some (constructive criticism) gets me so excited - and if I don't agree with them then I like to debate about the issue, very fun"
16278,E,N,T,J,"I think I understand what you mean, also the thing you say at the end may be also to the difference in E/I lol..

I am dating an INTJ atm and there are times when I talk and talk and he just looks at me and gives one word answers lol"
16279,E,N,T,J,"yeah, I don't know about that, I believe that ENTPs like to debate for the fun of it, not necessary for changing someone's mind

and I like to debate to find out more about each other's opinions, if one of us gains a new perspective from it, great.

I don't think wanting your conversation buddy to get to the same opinion as you is related to being an ENTP or ENTJ or any other type. that is just disrespectful- and it is a behavior which I think would be more commonly found in any type with high Ni, or Fi, or Si, but for INTP/ENTPs with high Ne/Ti, I believe it to be rather uncommon"
16280,E,N,T,J,"i don't think that everything should be a debate, but if we do have one... then i would like for both of us to be on the same page, and discuss until we are i.e. until we understand each other's argument and see the possible common ground - although i noticed not everyone is interested in that lol"
16281,E,N,T,J,"Well if it helps, I was obsessed with INFPs until I realised there's no chance an INFP would ever like me back (I was thinking boyfriend-wise haha), or even if he would, he would eventually be put off by my direct unapologetic problem solving style soo yeah

Thought about sticking with the NTs (although I wouldn't say no to an ISFP either)"
16282,E,N,T,J,"How do you know you will make it happen?

Of course this brings performance anxiety, how couldn't it be? You are putting this big, not even big, huge pressure on yourself.

I am wishing all the best, and I am certain you will make everything in your power to make it happen.

But accepting that 

(1) even if you do everything in your power to make it happen, things will not necessary work out exactly the way you want them to be AND

(2) that is perfectly fine

would certainly take the edge off your anxiety, thus granting you more energy to work towards the things you want to achieve.

As for me personally, I used to daydream a lot about looking extremely good, being super hot, having that car, everyone seeing me with the hot successful guy, making everyone who has ever thought of me as ""lower than"" jealous. And I did a lot of soul searching trying yo figure out why - what need would that fulfill? One by one, I broken down why I feel the way I do... And these are the conclusions for me personally

1) The guy is because society's ideas of success for a woman is tightly linked to who is she married to, unfortunately. A woman with a husband and child is seen/perceived as having more value. of course, the hotter the guy, the more value it adds to you. It's sad that society builds up women's ideas of success this way, but realising it is just a social construct and being successful on your own is enough and I am inherently valuable definitely made me think less and less about that hot successful guy - I good man is food for the soul, not an asset to be shown about, and if you pick one based on the latter, he might as well not be that food you needed for your soul, and you will live with the consequences of your actions forever. And nobody would even care who you are married to, because..

2) Nobody cares. everyone is so busy with their lives and their day, they use others' lives and stories like anecdotal evidence for THEIR life, THEIR story. How much do you think about a random Joe and June? That's how much others think about you too - and you won't even know whose mind you are fleetingly passes, if they're not close to you. You are like a number do them. A statistic. That June who laughed at me in highschool because I was poorly dressed - yes I thought about meeting her and being the bomb - but she wouldn't care, because she forgot about it. Yes she laughed repeatedly, maybe, but for her it was just a thing that came and passed and didn't give it a second thought. She didn't give a second thought that I looked bad, and she wouldn't give it a second thought that I look good. Yes maybe she would compare herself to me, just as she would compare herself to anyone who looks good, and since luckily there are a LOT of people who look good, if this is something she would do if she saw me looking very good - comparing herself to me - then I would have achieved the same result as if she saw a random woman on the street looking good. That is how little she would care.

3) Being hot is practical, this is definitely something I am working on, but I accept that I would never look as good as in my imagination, it simply won't happen - ever - because my image is unrealistic. I constantly try to work and improve what I have an observe what is and what I can do to improve, little by little, with tangible results, rather than what could be, and how I would look like in a far away land and distant future.

But what does YOUR soul need? What are your secret desires? To be accepted? To be loved? Working with a therapist - i went to a couple of therapists for a couple of years - could help you navigate these feelings and leave you more room to DO rather than DREAM."
16283,E,N,T,J,"I am not an artist by any means, but if I were to wish to develop in each direction, I  would allot a time of day to exercise, every day, regardless of the idea I have, big or small, and I would either do it a certain number of hours, or I would do a small project every day - although I am thinking about doing it for a certain number of hours, rather than per project.

I would also keep a list to write down my ideas during the day, and make time to watch others do it.

Which is actually how I approached drawing but then got discouraged after a couple of weeks because it wasn't that good - as you would expect.

I know that if I would just keep at it it would be fine, but atm the frustration of not starting earlier gets the better of me.

I also write poems whenever my inspiration strucks, but I make sure to read novels and books constantly, to keep my vocabulary and inspiration juices flowin'

&#x200B;

Although indeed I try to focus on the bigger picture when writing my poems, usually starting with a couple of lyrics about how I feel then moving on to describe a general truth (IMO at least) or anyways, write from a more distanced and calmer POV"
16284,E,N,T,J,"already 4.3k comments, wanted to pitch in and say that as a 25yo F working person, it is very reassuring to know that if I will ever struggle financially, I could temporarily get back to my parents home until I get back on track

I can't even think about how it would be like not to have this reassuring thought"
16285,E,N,T,J,"I can't believe how incredibly sweet what you are trying to do is.

16287,E,N,T,J,"well, learning programming is hard. it is not easy.

sure, there are some better or worse places, as some people already suggested

but even starting learning from worse places is an unvaluable experience, because in that way you will learn to appreciate better learning experiences

my programming motto is, and always was - everything you do, counts and is useful, as long as you move forward.

and 6 years later since i started learning programming, i still stand by it

spent a week trying to find a good tutorial? searching skills are very useful in programming, so good experience

spent a week on a bug that turned out to be very easy to fix but you just missed something? great experience for looking for bugs

searching and looking are just as valuable for programming as writing code and testing"
16288,E,N,T,J,"Thank you so much for this chart, so my Se is responsible for my hastiness, definitely something I am constantly working on lol"
16289,E,N,T,J,"Yeah, this thinking is definitely childish, no wonder this is trendy with the teenagers."
16290,E,N,T,J,""" He regularly reminds me that he is looking for someone who is 100% perfect ""

Okay, this is the part where I would have a serious conversation about the affirmation above, and dump him if he is not reconsidering/rephrasing.

He either is very stupid or most probably - as people already stated, a narcissist. A malignant nasty narcissist"
16291,E,N,T,J,"Yeah, also about ""people not investing in their appearance are not ready for dating"".

Well... some people simply do not invest in their looks.

Some people would like a follow-up text after a date. Some people don't care.

Some people get ghosted. Some people ghost and apparently according to reddit that is the worst sin on the face of the Earth.

Some people are very careful about 100 red/yellow flags and dismiss anyone who exhibits any of them, some people wait.

The most important thing is, as I was discussing with a girlfriend the other night, is to just be yourself, and do yourself, and the right people for your taste and their taste will come around and stick around"
16292,E,N,T,J,"yep, even if you're a complete mess inside LOL"
16293,E,N,T,J,"Yeah,people usually believe I know what I am doing and they are surprised if they find out that I don't LOL"
16294,E,N,T,J,this meme is too funny
16295,E,N,T,J,"I think extraversion/introversion is on a spectrum, just like gender or sexuality.

There are some MBTI types which are more prone to being ambivert in my opinion, for example ENTPs or ISFJs

I believe that this extraversion/introversion is not necessarly equivalent to the first letter of MBTI, but rather that the introverted/extraverted functions and their order may position you on this scale.

For example for the INTJ the first function is introverted intuition, and they do not have a need to share their views with the world, and also Te is not necessary very extroverted as you do not have to talk a lot to get things done.

But for an ISTJ with Si in the first slot and Te in second, they may be way more inclined to tell people about their preferences in doing things, simply because Si is about the external world and you wish to communicate with others about your preferences to help you achieve your Si vision.

An ENTP might not feel comfortable sharing their Ne ideas with people who would not take things the way they were intended.

And so on"
16296,E,N,T,J,ISTPs are so cool
16297,E,N,T,J,"I'll take the liberty of assuming you are asking this question in order to derive from my definition the fact that some types are indeed \*shallow\*, even in my sense, because whatever definition I have, then certainly some types are more inclined towards those characteristics. If I am wrong, I'm sorry, but I want to say something in case this is the case.

As Einstein said, you cannot judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.

For example (a very stereotypical example )some people may think that a  person who enjoys dancing and going to the club and does not read may be ""shallow"", but is it really? That person enjoys the present moment, that person is engulfed by its senses, that person inspires, brings people together and is just as crucial to a community as the person who sits all day reading and pondering on important matters.

You may assume that indeed, that person is not as deep and does not see issues as deep as the latter, but what if some issues are drawn to his/her attention? I highly doubt he/she would dismiss them - generally, if they are indeed open minded and not shallow/superficial.

In the same way, a person who reads all day, no matter the depth and length of thinking about things, would be shallow if he/she would judge the former, without trying to understand where they come from, and would not come to appreciate the benefits of living in the moment.

As with the former, in the latter there is a tendency to be in their head and not appreciate their surroundings or people who focus on the surroundings, but - generally, if they are presented with the benefits of this way of life or thinking, they will surely at least understand it, if not even appreciate and praise it, and the people living their life the way they want to, without thinking what others will think of them. That is, if they are not superficial/shallow..

I did not have a particular type in mind when writing this, but I was thinking about my cousin (who is ESFP) and myself (ENTJ)"
16298,E,N,T,J,You can be shallow in any type.
16299,E,N,T,J,"A lot of Ns on this sub are really just mistyped Ss

As for ESTJs/ISTJs, I think they're awesome (except for my ISTJ ex boyfriend, he's not awesome, lol)

ENTJs get the same kind of ""hate"" for some reason

I take the things I see the way they are intended hopefully, as a joke. If there is someone who sees them like anything else and bases their thinking and ideas about a type based off these stereotypes, well, it's their problem. The joke's on them lol.  They have to live with the consequences of their thinking full of prejudice - which surely spans to areas way larger than MBTI types and is sure to affect their life negatively overall. I truly pity them"
16300,E,N,T,J,"I don't think you can draw a line between ""you"" and your neurodivergent brain.

Still, there is no correlation between MBTI personality types and being neurodivergent, firstly because MBTI is not a scientifically validated personality framework.

Even in the case of OCEAN e.g. which is a scientifically validated personality assesment, I do not think there is a correlation necessary.

I believe you can be conscientious and have ADHD, or be laid back and have ADHD."
16301,E,N,T,J,"great, you do you.
some people wont swipe right IF you spent more than 2 munutes on your bio.

most importantly, everybody should just be themselves and they will find likeminded people

if you spend more than 2 minutes on your bio, even though from your pov its a waste of time, then what if you will have people swipin' right on you because of this? this difference is most probably the symptom of a larger and fundamental difference which will come to haunt you both at a later date

and lastly, just because someone doesn't write anything on their bio, does not mean that they won't put any effort into a conversation or a relationship. people decide hot to write anything for a lot of reasons"
16302,E,N,T,J,"I was just sharing my input, I don't even know what you think I am defending lol"
16303,E,N,T,J,"Oh, okay, it seemed to me you were referring to all ENTJs. In your experience of course. I wouldn't be so confident to make assumptions about an entire MBTI personality based off my own experience, but if you have that deduction capabilities, that's great."
16304,E,N,T,J,"I didn't know that if someone disagrees with me, i feel like they are attacking my competence and my ego flairs up big time, but now i know, thank you!!

To be fair, I can't speak for all ENTJs, but a lot of the times i don't see a reason to argue. I think about effort/results. Why is this person's opinion important to me? What would I gain from the argument? What would they gain?

When i was little-r I would have a tendency to make comments or think a certain way about the person stating the opinion, but not to win the argument, because I had no desire to continue/win the argument necessary, i saw no use to it, on either sides. Rather, I would shift the argument from what was initially being discussed, to the qualities in which we state our opinions, and what is the competence from where each of us brings something to the table. I was trying to create a framework for the discussion from where it would flow more effortlessly, and ultimately more efficiently. But I learned that people don't respond to well too this lol

The point is, those ""ad hominems"" you are talking about weren't arguments for the thing i was defending, they were meta arguments about the argument."
16305,E,N,T,J,"Definitely a deal breaker.

I totally sympathize with her concerns, but I am sure she had 1000 occasions to tell you about the debt, both before and after the marriage proposal, and 1000 times more inbetween.

She was literally planning on getting married and telling you AFTER. This is a huge violation of respect in my opinion.

Even if you don't care about money, and she knows it, it's about respect, and if she was planning on not telling you, then she doesn't respect you, and a relationship without respect is no relationship"
16306,E,N,T,J,"They don't want for you to be jealous necessary, I believe they want to just push their agenda through you to her and ultimately to her dad.

Maybe there are some issues between her and your stepmother as well, or resentments regarding her ex husband.

If you really want to step into this - which I see no reason too - I think the conversation would be more fruitful if it revolved around this, and the fact that even if they feel a certain way about this thing, what they want to do or obtain ultimately is not this cool.

But ultimately it's not your issue whatsoever and I would suggest staying out of it completely, cutting all conversations about this as short as possible. You're not jealous, you don't care. At some point they'll understand you want nothing to do with this"
16307,E,N,T,J,"Coffee dates sound extremely boring to me, I've been on coffee dates but frankly I find this activity so vanilla that I didn't even realize those people believed we are on a date"

16309,E,N,T,J,"I feel ya' sister, I've been seeing this guy and I sense he's starting to lose interest, maybe he was in for the chase (?) maybe he is not ready for the commitment, maybe he does not like something about me (?) there are so many maybes... As you said, there is no need to despair or settle but this whole investment is quite tiring and time consuming LOL

It sucks but I guess this is the game, and it is a number's game, at some point someone will stick..."
16310,E,N,T,J,"I don't entirely agree with Ni

You say Ni is subjective. Yes, it is, but it is based off the objective reality, it's about extracting the essence of something, to use later, to apply to other domain. I might have opinions about what I come up with based off the Se input, i might not like it at all, and Ni is definitely subjective in the sense that it's my filter the Se input goes through, but it's a constant work in progress, ever changing based on new information. Maybe it's a singular experience as a Te/Ni user, but I am never attached to my ideas and theories, and I love finding people to challenge them with.

I met an extreme Ni user as you described, but I believe the Ni s/he experiences are still mental flashed based off something on their mind.. It's not the Ni causing them to be mentally isolated. If you focus on something, of course that you will start getting ideas about that thing. I don't believe that anyone enjoys stimulating their Ni just for its own sake, it's always in help of something, help attaining a vision. Yes you could get a lot of ideas about that vision/dream, but its not Ni's work, it's simply the focus. You stop focusing, you stop being ""in your head"""

16316,I,N,T,P,That's a good point. If it's a random stranger of course I'll just say thanks and be happy. It's more if it's an acquaintance or someone I will have to see often. But I should really just learn not everything has to have a reason behind it

16330,I,N,T,P,"Don't come on too strong, I actually had an INTJ much like how you describe yourself interested in me. Where he messed up was texting me to the point of the conversation was dead, he would keep trying to revive it with small talk, making everything come back to why he likes me, and would not give up on the idea of a relationship even when I said no. I don't think you would do this, but even coming on too clingy will stress us out. I can't speak for all INTPs, but I'm somewhat of an aloof woman myself. What would work for me is just talk to her like she's a normal person and make a genuine connection. Then out of nowhere, throw in a random compliment, she may end up thinking about it and trying to figure it out for a while and then think about you"

I did this well before I even knew what mbti was, I didn't know if anyone else had this sort of annoying habbit. I even admit it's annoying. The lack of Fe also makes it so we don't care that we are subverting anything. But an ENTP that's developed their Fe they probably don't do this. Another reason I will do this is if someone expresses their positive emotion towards me, I don't know how to just say thank you, so I jokingly tease them to break the emotional tention, but my close friends still know I love them"

But the other thing to keep in mind is just because you see each other for a certain time doesn't make it serious, it's the dynamic that makes it serious or not. If it's too much for you, you should really just find someone else that matches your own needs better"
16342,I,N,T,P,"Seems like they were just trying to make sense of the functions they used based on their actions. It seems a bit weird to get that defensive about their type, given that MBTI is completely unscientific anyways"
16343,I,N,T,P,"Spontaneous and risk tasking is ExxxP usually, especially the focusing on something only if it's interesting. I guess I didn't see much Fi although strong willed could count. Maybe ENTP because out of the box thinking seems Ne Ti"
16344,I,N,T,P,ExTP
16345,I,N,T,P,Who would design a pool in a room like that? That looks wildly uncomfortable to be in
16346,I,N,T,P,"A combination. I like guys who are exciting adrenaline addicts, but are stable about their emotions. I'd prefer to date someone who is more stoic than not, especially because in my real life, Ive had experiences with guys who are very open and get attached easily. It made me uncomfortable and made me lose attraction for them. Maybe that sounds cold of me, but I just get suspicious towards those who get attached easily"
16347,I,N,T,P,"I also relate. I've only had 2 partners, but they only lasted for a couple months before I just couldn't do it anymore. I only dated them to try dating, and thinking maybe once I'm in a relationship the feelings would come naturally. They didn't. I think we just require a special kind of person because we get bored easily, and we just live to figure things out. I don't know if you'll ever find such a person, but I bet if you find someone with a similar temperament, you'll feel something. I hope it works out for you"
16348,I,N,T,P,I'd be cozy in here if not for that floor. It just looks like it smells like piss
16349,I,N,T,P,"Not businesses but I do this with inventions all the time. One time I was fed up at the train schedule so I invented public transit ""trains"" that did not run on a schedule, kind of similar to those scooters that are kept in a general location, but they can house up to 6 and still run along the tracks to stations"
16350,I,N,T,P,"Seems like it might be, I don't get this. I'm literally neutral to everyone until they give me a reason not to be"
16351,I,N,T,P,Oh boy do tell
16352,I,N,T,P,OMG SO TRUeeee!! That's why I will literally refuse to take my meds just to maintain my false superiority!!!
16353,I,N,T,P,"Unfortunately, you didn't choose the correct build for a Chad. You should've chosen the ESTP build, but the ENTJ is also a very good build for a Chad. Maybe you should start the game over and choose ENTJ as your class so you can have the not lose pens trait. Or if you get the shadow skin, you can play as an INTJ when need be. Fortunately if you dumped enough points into the Fe trait, you can use your high charisma mod to just force people to give you their pens"
16354,I,N,T,P,Imagine being the architect who designed this space. They probably don't even know it has a semi cult following
16355,I,N,T,P,I would've guessed ISxP from all the music stuff
16356,I,N,T,P,"I see posts all the time where people glorify being petty and even borderline abusive to their partners, probably not even realizing their behavior is abusive. In their mind they are ""quirky and crazy and an endearing way"" but it just makes me cringe"
16357,I,N,T,P,"You don't mind structure or being in charge, which sounds like good Te, you seem like an introvert because of being refreshed from alone time, and you do seem to have Se but it isn't prominent. So that's why I would guess INTJ. the need for logical consistency also shows you are likely a thinker but that sounds more Ti, though that doesn't nullify being an INTJ either."
16358,I,N,T,P,INTx I think maybe J
16359,I,N,T,P,"I'm never sure of anything, because there are so many ever changing factors, and then there's also the error of human perception. My ExTJ friend doesn't understand this"
16360,I,N,T,P,"Life doesn't have to be miserable, find something you really wanna do, and work to get there. I have wasted my short life not committing to a lot, but the things I have, my skills grew in even just a short time. It's good to have something you care about. Figure out what that is"
16361,I,N,T,P,The school one took me out

16365,I,N,T,P,As a South African in his early 20s this is the first time I'm hearing about this
16366,I,N,T,P,This post feels sarcastic
16367,I,N,T,P,"Problem solving & analyzing, that's what I wanted to hear the most."
16368,I,N,T,P,I had to think about it for a good 10 seconds but I see it..
16369,I,N,T,P,"In high school, I'll blame apathy and laziness. I never strived for anything because I was always acknowledged for being smart despite giving zero effort and that made me be okay with the bare minimum. When I got to university, that really required me to put in as much effort as I could possible and I simply did not know how. I didn't know how to be diligent in my studying, I always looked for short cuts, I procrastinated and all of that really showed in my results. Truth is getting out of these slumps is easy if you can just find it in you to give the max effort and be consistent. Then it becomes a lifestyle and you can at least do well. Sadly I only figured this out a little too late."
16370,I,N,T,P,I love that you learn while doing the project and the fact that there's a ton of online help to get you through your work.
16371,I,N,T,P,Had to calculate that last one in my head
16372,I,N,T,P,You don't need the entirety of any of these but I'd say start with linear algebra and then go into probability then stats.
16373,I,N,T,P,Are you trying to get into machine learning? Oh and my answer is no
16374,I,N,T,P,“INTPs would be okay with lies as long as they’re for the sake of kindness” this is cool to see in fiction. Scheming and strategy is something I greatly admire but to have that sort of uncertainty and falsehood in my own life would be greatly uncomfortable. Which is why I say something kind when I mean it or rather nothing if its not so kind hearted. I like straight forward truth.
16375,I,N,T,P,More times than I can count...
16376,I,N,T,P,I have a crush on Azula from Avatar so this checks out
16377,I,N,T,P,A book? You think too highly of me
16378,I,N,T,P,Yeah but I never confront them. I just observe from afar and wait for it to come crashing down
16379,I,N,T,P,Chill as fuck
16380,I,N,T,P,Yes.. I'm not proud of any of this
16381,I,N,T,P,I laughed way too hard at this
16382,I,N,T,P,"Overall a computer science course is somewhat a math course with coding in it, but that just shows just how vast mathematics is, I'd say you're looking to do is a perfect combination. You'll figure it out all in good time so don't worry about any of it now"
16383,I,N,T,P,"That's wonderful! I loved Differential equations. All of this is only the beginning hey, once you get to other things like Group Theory and Real analysis you'll see mathematics in a completely different light"
16384,I,N,T,P,Sounds like you have a good excuse. I'm a graduate who majored in mathematics. Anyway Linear Algebra is great and I hope you have a wonderful math experience for the rest of your academic years
16385,I,N,T,P,Wow something I actually understand
16386,I,N,T,P,"I'll never agree with what I disagree with. But I will say ""whatever"""
16387,I,N,T,P,"I don't argue, the other person usually is though. That's how I keep winning"
16388,I,N,T,P,Before I turned 18 I actually enjoyed being out with friends every now and then. This would have genuinely bothered me
16389,I,N,T,P,"This happened almost every time with me. End of a night of drinking always feels so empty, one of the reasons I stopped"
16390,I,N,T,P,First 3 hours of the party is the second one. Last one hour of the party is the first one.
16391,I,N,T,P,"I felt like this yesterday after completing a project I wanted to do for a while, but it was kind of the same as what I did the day before that so I think what I'm looking for is to constantly level up on the complexity of my projects. Nothing gives me more joy than figuring out difficult tasks. Try that"
16392,I,N,T,P,Honestly no. Its really more about the culture of where you live I think
16393,I,N,T,P,"The Barbershop is spot where there is a lot of buzz among the people there, the barbers never try to force a conversation with you because they already have one going on around them so that works well for an introverted customer"
16394,I,N,T,P,I think this works for us black dudes a little better
16395,I,N,T,P,"No its actually quite relaxing, especially if your barber isn't constantly trying to make conversation. He just talks to the other people around and I get enjoy that chair and be in my thoughts while I get my hair cut. Its quite good"
16396,I,N,T,P,At 19 yeah this might have been me
16397,I,N,T,P,"How many of you would actually respond somewhat like this, seriously?"
16398,I,N,T,P,They will grow up and get over it
16399,I,N,T,P,This is for dating and not just for general human interaction?
16400,I,N,T,P,I believe that our thinking is valid

16404,I,N,T,P,"Exactly, the only time I don't care to be on time is if something is completely unimportant"
16405,I,N,T,P,You know... I'm always early for everything and everyone else is always late. Weird

16462,E,N,T,P,Lmao that’s why I never read them. I don’t want the ending to be destroyed with kids.
16463,E,N,T,P,"Yes, I definitely relate to that! I have many ideas and while I normally never execute them, it’s hard to let others do something I’ve thought of wrongly. So I end up doing everything like you said."

16485,E,N,T,P,Aro is that you don’t feel any romantic attraction so that you don’t want to be in a romantic relationship. Aro’s can still desire a relationship and they definitely also can like physical affection (in a platonic sense). There are many different ways that you can be aro!

In a loop: I’m also really enjoying this story and I love the love/hate relationship, but she uploads pretty slow so it’s hard to actually remember everything and really get into it. (I’m not holding this against her tho, I’m sure that she works hard)


Point of view: I haven’t read this one


A different path: I really wanted to read this, but the MC is just so small and I personally can’t stand that (in episode, not irl) and she seems so annoying so I couldn’t really get into it."
16498,E,N,T,P,"Wait I might be thinking of the wrong person, but I’m pretty sure that that was a lie. I think that she told her that because she wanted to scare her off (or something like that), but they’re just friends and she later becomes friends with the MC herself.

Also, I hate when I'm on cams and I'm trying to keep track of who went in where and who didn't come out, etc, but then I forget. I caught two people venting and someone killing \[three different games\] last night though. That was cool. I've finally  learned how to use cams and I've been catching important things.

In another game, also last night, I saw purple and brown in storage, then they went up in the direction of shields \[I'm on cams\] and I started seeing purple again but I never saw brown, then someone reported brown's body in shields and I told everyone what I saw but everyone just C O M P L E T E L Y ignored me because someone saw someone running around near shields... anyway, it was purple \[and someone else, I forgot who\] and they won the game, eventually. :D"

16532,I,N,T,J,"Most of us [I'm not a liberal, but I am an activist] don't harass people. And, the reason that we come at people too strongly is either because 1) We need to make them see that it is an issue. It's been years, centuries, and we haven't changed anything by being quiet and trying to converse, or 2) We don't come at people too strongly, but, because they're not used to hearing about inequality in their life, find it to be strong. I'm serious. It's like experiencing something for the first time, it's always different the first time."
16533,I,N,T,J,"It's cute how people keep downvoting this instead starting a conversation and responding to the question [those who did that, this isn't about you]. Like, the majority of the comments say something along the lines of ""liberals have no idea what they're talking about and they never have reasons or justification for their behavior/hatred,"". Yeah, right, only liberals [and all, according to you guys] do that. 

We have a certain guy in this country who, instead of answering questions that reporters respectfully ask by dismissing them, insulting them, or mocking them. Who? Trump. Right. The conservative president."
16534,I,N,T,J,"My favorite people are the ones saying ""I'm tired of waling on eggshells"". Like, what? What is it that's so hard to avoid? Using racial slurs, purposely misgendering someone, being sexist, or doing anything that is meant to harm someone? 

I have no idea why people think it's difficult. No one asking for something extra, for special treatment. People are asking that when you choose to interact with them, don't be hurtful on purpose. I thought that we should be good people? 

It seems like, to some people, being good is difficult and comparable to ""walking on eggshells"". 

Also, to the OP and everyone saying ""me too"": If you are stressed by the activism and don't see why it's so strong and ""in your face"", then know that you are the people who are advantaged in that sense. Just because you don't suffer from what's being talked about, it doesn't mean others go to bed without being hurt for no reason. You are at an advantage for not understanding why it's so because it means that you don't experience unjustified hurting."

Sorry, I think I mixed your reply with someone else's. I understand that POV. I think I'd be the same with LDRs, but I wouldn't mind something starting out that way. 

I wasn't planning on ghosting him and keeping him as a background friend at the same time. It's more of an either or. I think I'll go with ""background friend"" for the sake of Minecraft and the shows we watch. It would feel really really weird to keep watching Criminal Minds on my own if I ghosted him. I used to watch it before him, but I started from the beginning before I finished it so that we can watch it together; and, now it would be weird to rewatch the episodes [leading up to where I left off before him] but on my own. 

Thank you for your insight and advice."
16542,I,N,T,J,"Thank you, this means a lot. 

You're right, there isn't really any straightforward advice.

I don't want to talk to him about any of it because I already tried to explain how stupid this all was and he was either too thick headed to see things from my side, or he purposely pretended that he couldn't. So, I don't want to make it known that I still think about this. I don't think he deserves to know. Also, recently I've been getting more emotionally distant from the situation . So, I think I will continue to do this part time ghosting thing. I'll keep him around for when I feel like talking, just like he does. I think I'll care less and less soon. The fall semester is starting soon and I'll have lots of work to do and things to think about. 

I hope I eventually feel nothing towards this, and find a real friend at some point. 

Thanks again, really. It's nice for someone to see my side of it all."
16543,I,N,T,J,"I matched with a guy on okc and I was just on there to ""make new friends"", but then I started liking him more so I told him. So, he says he likes me like that too, and we decide that we should meet up a bunch of times before we call us anything [duh]. Then, the pandemic happened. 

Context: he's five years older than me, I'm in college, he's graduated and has a full time job, and we live 3 hours apart.

We discussed the above things, more than once, and decided that they don't really matter. We have on virtual date [we watched a dem party's primary elections debate 'together']. At one point, back when we first discussed them, he said that if we do end up being a serious thing then he can move closer to me because his job is a work from home thing.

Neither of us has asked to meet in person yet, and, duh? I mean, it was very inconvenient at the moment. But, we did discuss things we'd do when we do meet up. And, all our conversations were at least a tad bit more than platonic. 

Fast forward 5 months, and some girl that he went on 3 dates with, 3 years ago, asks him out. So, he says yeah. Then he tells me [yes, after] and says that he thought it would be fun and he was interested. And, ""she told me we can't date 3 years ago, but I liked her a lot then. so, unless she's changed a lot, then I still like her at least a little,"". Great!!! I love this. Would've been nice to know about ""like her at least a little"" back in January. 

Anyway. After the first date with her, he starts ""liking her a lot more"", and now he decides that we should just be friends. His reasons? ""You're younger than me and at a different life stage, you live 3 hours away and I would like to see the person I'm in a relationship more than once every few weeks, you don't love yourself, you don't have clear goals for your future, and maybe we won'tbe physically compatible"". Yes. All my fault, apparently. All my ""flaws"" are the reason that we can't date and should just be friends. And, wtf?? I do love myself. Also, I literally have an outline for my life *written down*, and he knows that. I only talk about my future and what I want to do [not literally, but, you get it]. And, we have discussed physical compatibility before. So, he decided that he wants to date someone more conveniently available, drop me out of nowhere, and then blame it all on false things about me, and things we have discussed and decided wouldn't be a problem. 

So. That happened. 

Honestly, I don't care that we never dated. She still would've messaged him and asked him out, and I bet he would've said yes, or, at the very least, wanted to. Clearly, he doesn't know what he wants. I think he just used me for a connection for 5 months until someone else came along, someone who wanted to date him. 

I wouldn't be as hurt/mad about this if he had a conversation with me about this and we reached the conclusion that, yeah, maybe we would be better off as just friends. But, no. We didn't. He just dumped all this nonsense at me when someone else became an option, not because he sees it as valid stuff. And that's what I hate. If we called off the potential relationship before Ms. Three Years Ago showed up, I wouldn't have minded any of this at all. 

I don't like him the same anymore. Now he seems stupid, irresponsible, and like water that just flows into whatever hole is closest to it. I hate him, a bit, now. And, that's another thing that I hate about everything that happened. I liked him a lot as a friend, and we got along so well. And, when he did that, I lost that too. I should ghost him, because I don't want to be around for him the way he wants me to be. I still talk to him, as a friend, but I've started responding less and rarely reaching out first. I hate that. I wish whatever he is right now would die and the fake person that I met first would come back. I don't like this new person. And, I feel like it's rude to myself to still be his friend. 

We used to watch shows together on Netflix party, and he asked me earlier if I wanted to watch some Criminal Minds tonight. I said yeah. But, after tonight, I will ghost him. I'm sick of this. I'm only hanging on because I like what was. But, I don't like what is. It sucks. It feels like January through July was a dream. It's all fuzzy, I feel sick inside, and I feel very, very alone. Obviously, he's doing alright. He has someone new to talk to, and he probably never even liked me all along. But I now have to find a new friend [I tend to have one close friend at a time, and it was him while I knew him] and deal with emptiness. 

Now that I think about this, he did do what you said. Stupid internet relationship that goes nowhere. Except, we never intended it to be so. I would've not minded a LDR, but he said that he doesn't like them and wants to meet in real life and keep doing so if we click. So, technically, he only half did what you said. Also, he lied. 

Do you have any tips? I'm asking everyone. Is it the best idea to ghost him? I think so. What do you think? 

The only thing that makes me not want to ghost him is that we have a world in minecraft together and it would kill me to just drop it and drop all the work that I/we put into it. Also, I joined a minecraft server that he's in and we were/are working on a base together. What would happen if I ghost him? Should I just make him a background ""friend""? [Background ""friend"": someone that I only reply to if they reach out, and just talk to a bit about once a month.]"

16549,I,N,T,J,"Yay, I don't have to comment lol.

You nailed it. The details are important if people are considering a relationship. And, if someone asks, then I guess they'd have to listen. I don't get why many people want things simplified just because their sexualities are straightforward and simple. 

Also, at least the post said that there are four types of sexualities, and then said ""attracted to the opposite *sex*"", etc, instead of saying ""attracted to the opposite *gender*"", etc. Yeah, sexualities tend to be about the other person's sex. Gender and specificities are important in the right contexts."

16551,I,N,T,J,"Honestly, sometimes it's me that doesn't take it well when a friend tells me they have feelings for me. It happened all throughout my life. I tend to befriend guys, then they develop feelings, then I feel betrayed. Now that I'm more mature, I don't feel upset about it. So, I'll only count the last few guys.

One of them stayed friends with me and tried to ignore his feelings, but we drifted apart. [RIP our friendship, he was a bright part of my life:|] The other one became so bitter and cold and passive aggressive, so I cut him out of my life. Then there are the guys that I don't know, and, holy fucking shit. I would reject them nicely and they would still insist. Like, they won't fuck off."
16552,I,N,T,J,"Me versus my family, lol. Lol but I'm not laughing. It drives me off the edge sometimes.

Can people just stop the party and address the problems?"
16553,I,N,T,J,"I didn't mean to say that having hair makes you unclean. I'm saying that, for me, personally, I feel cleaner when there's nothing there.

Here's a better way to explain it: I'm all for people having hair [as in, on their head], and I know that it doesn't mean that their hair and/or scalp are dirty. However, I think that it would be easier to keep a bald head clean. Me, personally. You can see everything, and there's nothing for the nasty stuff to get attached to.

But, it's all about personal hygiene. Whether someone shaves/waxes or not, they can be clean down there or not. It's basic hygiene, at the end of the day. Some of us find it easier to keep a clear floor when it's a hardwood floor, and others don't mind the carpet [metaphor]."
16554,I,N,T,J,"I understand how you feel about taxes, now that you include these numbers. 

I have mixed feelings about taxes. I love the idea of taxes when the money comes back though services and a better country [roads, schools, a clean environment, nice public parks, a good police force, first responders, fire departments, etc] but, these days, it seems like our taxes are going to waste [1) excessive military funding only to deploy all the soldiers somewhere unnecessary, risking their lives and wasting our money, 2) military aid to other countries, 3) building a wall which is useless and stupid, to name a few].

In your ideal world, would you pay taxes? If not, why? If yes, what would you like it to go to? 

And, would you agree that the health and economy of a nation is better when everyone has a little extra money to spend? I do. I just think that, to get there, there's a lot about the way that we run the country that has to change. For starters: What, who, and how much we tax. Where our taxes are used. Raising the minimum wage, better infrastructure, more jobs in impoverished areas, recruiting people for jobs instead of leaving them to the streets, etc. What do you think about that?

Lastly, where do you fall on the political compass? You don't have to answer that, I'm just curious. And/or, do you have a label for your political affiliation? I want to have a better understanding of all the different labels, so it would help if I had an affiliation to associate with your reply."

16556,I,N,T,J,"Because a real libertarian knows that the government should exist to protect and serve.

16557,I,N,T,J,"I am SUPER anti-marriage*, and I mean, mega, but if people want to get married then they should have the right to [so long as they're all consenting adults].

*You can ask me why. I'm always happy to explain."
16558,I,N,T,J,"I sometimes feel very overwhelmed and alone, almost like I was running with the world and I stopped to tie my shoes and I looked up and everyone was ahead of me and I can try to run and catch up but I'm not fast enough and then I just start walking and I see them trip, I see them fall, I see one about to give up, but I'm too far away for me to change anything about it and it's awfully quiet where I walk alone. Oh, the song, lol. It's a really good song. If you don't know what song I'm talking about, ignore this lol.

I don't understand the feeling, when it comes around. It's overwhelming. It's accompanied by a feeling of complete detachment. Like, I'd be sitting in a lecture hall and I look at the class and hear the professor speaking, but I feel disconnected from the moment. I just start thinking way beyond what's happening, and thoughts like ""the planet is dying,"" ""you've never been in a relationship,"" ""you have issues with attachment,"" start popping up. Then other thoughts like ""that guy looks so done, I wonder if he's suicidal? he looks like it,"" ""this girl looks tired. she's black. I wonder what it's like to be black. wow, I feel bad, she's a woman and she's black,"" (an actual thought process that I have A LOT btw. at random moments, I look at people and what I already knew about their suffering hits me again and I feel an overwhelming surge of empathy and admiration and also an ""I want to make your life better "" sort of emotion -is there a name for that emotion?). 

That was too much, and it was probably off topic. 

But, yeah. I do sometimes get this feeling like I have so many emotions pent up and I don't know what to do to release them. Usually, I just mope around the house or watch a show while thinking. Once, during a time when that was happening, my mom stopped me while I was walking to ask me what was wrong. She said I'm walking like I'm injured, or physically in pain. No, mom, lol. The world is just too much."
16559,I,N,T,J,"I hate when people start yelling in arguments but, and I hate to say it, I do it to. There's a tipping point, when I feel like someone betrayed me a lot and that's when I start yelling out of confusion, hurt, and disappointment.

Example:
>>Today my mom was talking to my sister about something she does which she shouldn't and my sister was acting bitchy and saying things like ""don't tell me something that isn't coming from you"" [hinting that I asked my mom to talk to her about it which, yes I did, but everyone in the house hates that thing she does and my mom always talks to her about it. it's not like my mom needed me complaining for her to talk to my sister about that thing.] She also said ""and stop lecturing me out loud, just so that she can hear you and be satisfied,"". Well, here's the funny part. I didn't hear my mom talking to her about it. I heard her yelling and saying that, so I knew that that was happening
>>>> So, I went over to where they were and said something like ""hey mom, if someone does X and you talk to them about it because it's wrong and bothersome and they get upset about it and refuse to listen and act like they're not annoying at all and yell, then they're the ones bringing attention to themselves, not you,"". [I do this thing where I don't directly talk to a person who is acting like that, and instead I just direct the message at them through someone else.]
>>>>>> My sister turns around and says ""go to sleep,"". She's mocking me because I have sleeping issues and a terrible sleeping ""schedule"" and, at least a few times a week, I stay up for too long for 2 days or so and end up sleeping in on the third day. So, I got really really really annoyed because I'm not a fan of getting mocked/insulted for my issues. 
>>>>>>>>I turn to my mom for her to tell my sister to not say that and my mom laughs and says ""yeah, go sleep,"". You better bet I started yelling. I said many things, but they were all versions of ""how dare you? instead of keeping this about the actual issue, you mock me and affirm her behavior?,"" and then I went to my room, turned off the lights, locked the door, and just thought and thought for a long time. I hate when I yell, and I hate when I make dramatic expressions of feelings. It always comes back to haunt me sometime later. Probably during another argument when someone mocks me for what I get annoyed by. It took my sister 3 minutes to mock the way I was yelling. 🙃

Anyway. That's the kind of betrayal that I meant. When you expect someone to have your back, or be reasonable, or be the one in charge and do it right, and they just drop you like that. It hurts everytime. 

Other scenarios when I yell: 
<when someone is being mistreated>
<when someone is being stupid> [example: my brother argued that abortion is wrong because ""babies have feelings"" (lol, they're not babies, and, no, they don't) and then went on to argue that it's not wrong to slaughter cows and eat them (these beings actually *do* have feelings) and I pointed out the hypocrisy and then he says ""I don't care. You can't keep saying that women have the right to their body, when you're killing babies. And these cows are okay to kill because I want to eat them,"" (not the exact wording). You better bet I yelled a lot then. I got so upset about his sexism (he's sexist for manyreasons, but that argument was more complex and his sexism was evident through it more than I can explain) that I was in my room, crying, trying to calm down, and also feeling every upset with humans because they still argue over abortion and whether or not we have the right to murder sentient beings and then eat their flesh. I yell a lot when we debate because he always has something like that to say. I decided to never debate with him ever again.]

I try not to yell, because I know that yelling is ineffective and hurtful [to me, too, and I care about myself, at the very least], and I know that I learned it from my least favorite person in the world. But, I've yet to get rid of that habit. I've recently started avoiding things that make me yell. I haven't talked to my brother in over a month. I haven't talked to my sister in about a month. And I will never again respond to my sister's insults/mockery. Etc"

16568,I,N,F,P,"my family has been giving me such shit for not getting a tan this summer lmao. like first off we’re in a pandemic so it’s not like we’re going on beach trips every day, but even then skin cancer runs HEAVY in our family of irish-americans!! i’m not sunscreen  obsessed but hell yea i’m gonna put some spf 30 on and hang out under a shady tree instead of baking myself to a graham cracker crisp!!"
16569,I,N,F,P,i once had a dream where i was trying to decide what to name my baby after giving birth & suddenly the baby looked right at me and said in a deep voice “my names Copernicus” and i screamed and woke up lol
16570,I,N,F,P,"i’m going thru this exact thing now, i even made a similar post here about it a few weeks ago! it sucks and is a really confusing time. i feel like i’m going thru all that “your body is changing” weird puberty stuff all my peers did as teenagers, but because i’m 21 it feels less acceptable somehow. it’s disorienting and combined with having BDD before all of it, very hard to deal with. i understand you completely ❤️"
16571,I,N,F,P,"i think the name is adorable! most pets end up going by a ton of nicknames anyway so i don’t think it matters much. my cousin got a kitten when he was 3, he named her Mexico bc he’d just learned about other countries in preschool & thought the name was “the mostest beautiful”. i feel like the name will be more special to everyone involved, esp your daughter, to let her name her cat what she wants :)"
16572,I,N,F,P,"damn y’all have some rlly creative ones i’m kinda insecure about mine now lmaoo

16573,I,N,F,P,"i have this issue too, i totally understand. it makes me sad a lot cuz i know my parents are sad that they don’t have any photographic memories of their own daughter from the last few years :("
16574,I,N,F,P,my brothers kindergarten teacher did that too! his name is benjamin but she thought it was too long for him to write out so she “named” him ben. he’s 19 now and everyone except family calls him ben it’s so weird lol. then again most of us call him bear so i guess ben isn’t too bad
16575,I,N,F,P,"my full name is bethany and it’s the worst when it comes to issues like this lol. most of my family calls me bethany, my close family calls me beth, and i don’t even like either of those names so i started going by bea in the rest of the world! it was chaos when at my 21st bday with family and friends, all my friends were like “who’s beth(any)?” and my family was like “who’s bea?”"
16576,I,N,F,P,i used it while also using .025% tret daily... and no spf😭😭😭
16577,I,N,F,P,"i love these names! i don’t have kids lol but the almost name that my mom almost gave me was Samantha Nicole but within minutes of being born my dad decided i didn’t look like one and they changed it to Bethany Anne, boring lol"
16578,I,N,F,P,annaliese? i think it sounds strong and historic but she could also go by anna as a nickname if u want it more traditional!
16579,I,N,F,P,"not a specific name but i guess more old-fashioned or “classic” names like helen, jane, mary etc., but i’m probably just biased cuz i have one of those classic type names and i hated it growing up lol. i do like some tho! alice and blaire are on my list, for example!"
16580,I,N,F,P,apparently belle from beauty and the beast is an INFP!
16581,I,N,F,P,i’m a sagittarius sun and an enneagram 4w3 and i don’t think those two are typically associated lol. but sagittarius is ruled by the same planet as pisces and pisces definitely are so idk!
16582,I,N,F,P,i guess maybe i just had a judgmental dentist growing up because when i was a kid and wouldn’t floss everyday (like lots of kids do) he would tell me i needed to get it together or he’d pull my teeth out and make me dentures which scared me lol. i’ve been seeing this new dentist for the last year so i’ve been twice and they seem ok but they’ve also never seen my teeth this bad
16583,I,N,F,P,YES YES YES ok thank god im not the only one. my family thinks i’m crazy. they recently rearranged the living room furniture and now the couch is directly in front of three huge windows and they refuse to close the curtains because “vitamin d is good for you” and i keep leaving the room to check on my face cuz i’m so worried how it looks in that light
16584,I,N,F,P,"i would wanna be an ESTJ, complete opposite of what i am now, just to see how much better or worse life would be lol"
16585,I,N,F,P,"i had this problem around six months ago so i definitely feel your frustration on this, it’s an awful feeling :( my hair is very dense and i can usually go 5-6 days between washes but during this time period it wouldn’t even fully dry it was so greasy. i identified my problem which was A) i had switched shampoo and conditioner brands several months before that; i wanted to use a natural brand cuz i thought it’d be healthier but using it for a few months gave me horrible buildup, which was causing my grease, and B) the water in my showerhead was hard and that combined with the shitty shampoo was causing the buildup. the first thing i did was buy a filtered showerhead on amazon for $30, which has been a godsend. next, i got a salon clarifying shampoo; i got Eufora Urgent Repair Clarifying Shampoo and the Urgent Repair Treatment. i used these two products twice a week for about a month, and then the buildup was gone! i switched to using shea moisture products and my hair has been happy the last five months with that!"
16586,I,N,F,P,"my favorites are these (they either directly reference BDD or describe the same feelings i have in my life dealing with BDD)

16587,I,N,F,P,"my skin is fairly sensitive and dry so it inflamed my skin quite a bit when i started doing it, i’ve found better luck with just oil cleansing with almond oil and being really diligent in gently rinsing it all off with a wet towel. but i also don’t wear much makeup beyond some concealer so i don’t need much to take off"
16588,I,N,F,P,i’m in the US! i think i can ship them from here to NZ but i’ve never tried before!
16589,I,N,F,P,"i have a .025% prescription that i keep getting refills for but i don’t use tret anymore (i have rosacea so it didn’t help much with that), i could ship some to you if you’d like? i have two tubes rn and i usually get another three pack of tubes every other month for $40"
16590,I,N,F,P,"NTA. it’s your life, if your name doesn’t line up with what you want out of life then change it!!! it’s yours!!! my legal name is bethany but i never connected with it, plus i HATED inevitably being called beth so i woke up one day and decided to go by Bea (first two letters of my first name and first letter of my middle name anne). it was hard for my family at first even tho i gave them leeway, but in all other parts of my life it’s been great! 10/10 recommend and worst case, change it back if u regret it :)"
16591,I,N,F,P,i’m a girl INFP & i would absolutely loveeee to date another INFP i get along with them so well
16592,I,N,F,P,"me: “ok i got a 28 what does that mean”

16593,I,N,F,P,"i think that’s adequate sun protection but just fyi a lot of derms and esthis will recommend staying away from anything that’ll make u hot and sweaty after using acids that strong for a few days, because it isn’t just sunlight that irritates the sensitized skin, it’s the heat from being outside, sweat, and friction from ur mask too! it won’t be the end of the world or anything but just wanted to let u know cuz i made that mistake with the same peel it was bad lol"
16594,I,N,F,P,i think they work well for keeping hair smooth and skin wrinkle free but you have to wash it way more often because it’s almost like the silk holds all the oils from your skin and hair which make u feel greasy in the morning. it got so bad for me that the wrinkle free notion wasn’t even worth it anymore lol i just use cotton ones and am training myself to sleep on my back. you can try a silk bonnet/hair wrap to protect your hair!
16595,I,N,F,P,"NAH. i see both your points and tho i’m more inclined to agree with hers cuz i’m biased towards little dogs, i get that you wouldn’t feel the same way. but seriously, as someone who’s owned a husky and worked at a dog shelter for 10 years, they are NOT good first time dogs and definitely not for everyone. i’ve seen countless huskies brought back to the shelter after being adopted because of how much people underestimate the work and just want a “pretty dog”. the amount of walks and exercise you think you’re going to be doing with a husky will not be close to enough. and good luck getting a security deposit back lol lots of them rip and bite furniture and since they’re so smart sometimes they’ll do it to be petty. my husky bit through a wall one time because i left her at home to go out with friends during her walk time. why don’t you look into austrailian shepard’s? they’re adorable and loyal and cuddly/sweet which would be good for your gf, but super active (not as active as a husky tho which is good)! they’re a medium size dog breed which is a good compromise i think. my aussie is the most loyal and loving dog i’ve ever owned and she also loves hiking with me!"
16596,I,N,F,P,ogx coconut coffee body cream is my go to for this!! it almost dries too quickly for my taste so i sometimes apply a second coat. plus the coffee smell is amazing but fades nicely into a subtle scent
16597,I,N,F,P,ok ok let’s not be so loud
16598,I,N,F,P,lol yep 4w3 and an INFP
16599,I,N,F,P,yes but i have so many ways i want to accomplish that that i’m paralyzed by the choices so i end up doing nothing and hating myself for it lmao
16600,I,N,F,P,"idk man the rudest, most entitled people i’ve ever met in person were from the ass beating generation and the nicest most understanding were from the time out generation. it’s almost like verbal communication and allowing children to process emotions in a neutral space, instead of lazily turning to violence, tends to yield empathetic adults competent in communication with excellent coping skills. could be wrong though"
16601,I,N,F,P,oof
16602,I,N,F,P,"i’m not dairy free but my dad went vegan a year ago so there’s signifantly less dairy products in the house ( i usually only have dairy when going out or if i bring home ice cream etc) and it isn’t a miracle worker, tho i think it’s helped a little bit with redness and also how fast my papules heal"
16603,I,N,F,P,"thank you for the advice. i really do appreciate it. the problem with losing weight for me is that i’ve only gained like 8 pounds of actual weight, it’s my literal body shape that’s changed. like my hip bones went outward and it just overall changed which is difficult for me to swallow. but i guess i just have to get over it cuz this is how i am now"
16604,I,N,F,P,"cerave irritates my skin, i use ceramedx cream! it’s by no means a total miracle worker for me but it’s helped significantly with repairing my damaged moisture barrier and softening my skin, which has made my redness and PIE go down quite a bit"
16605,I,N,F,P,"i oil cleanse at night with almond oil to get off my spf and concealer, and in the mornings i just pat my face with a wet towel lol. my skin isn’t perfect from it but oh boy the splotchiness has gotten so much better and my skin feels softer and smoother"
16606,I,N,F,P,"i literally had a panic attack in public yesterday cuz my grandpa tried taking a picture of me. super embarrassing lol. yea i avoid cameras at all times, angle my phone screen away from my face just in case i catch my reflection, and have all my mirrors covered in my house"
16607,I,N,F,P,thanks :)
16608,I,N,F,P,hey! how did you add your type to your comment like that?
16609,I,N,F,P,"every time i take an mbti test i always get INFP first and INFJ second and i lowkey relate to both so it’s interesting you bring it up. in my case i think i used to be more INFJ until i hit my late teens and was hit really hard with a slew of mental health issues that i still suffer from, including depression, which i think have changed me from a J to a P; idk if that’s permanent tho."
16610,I,N,F,P,i think it looks good but it doesn’t look like what you originally wanted. the pinterest one looks more ashy and silvery and she gave u a very warm balyage for sure. maybe she didn’t tone it right?

When you divide people up and don’t allow them to speak based around the color of their skin, that is segregation. It’s not needed for spam prevention. There are tons of subs that deal with tons of spam on the daily, and yet BPT is the only one that has resorted to requiring you to identify your race to comment and post."
16652,E,N,T,P,Its okay man. I probably wrote it poorly. Have a good day.

16656,E,N,T,P,So you’re more angry that the “white supremacists” win by having a black community online hardway segregate themselves than the fact that they’re choosing to segregate?
16657,E,N,T,P,It’s paraphrased but yes.
16658,E,N,T,P,I’ve spoken with a lot of people online lately that assume the majority of white people are racist. Roll that over in your brain a few times and see if you can spot the hypocrisy

You sound like a 9. A lot of 9s ""feel 4ish"" when alone or when with their partner."
16716,I,N,F,P,9w8 is ok with just being (a sloth) and 9w1 isn't.
16717,I,N,F,P,"That's a bit too far.

Most people just grow out of shyness. Some kids are very impulsive, some lack focus, some are shy, some a bit aggressive, some super loud, some cry a lot... we all have ""bad"" and ""good"" traits. That's just how life is."
16718,I,N,F,P,"True, I just don't care all year long"
16719,I,N,F,P,"Can't really remember anymore. I THINK it was Drew (one of her friends, also a Youtuber) who posted a video explaining a lot of stuff.

At least Marina was getting help behind the scenes. Something I don't really see happening in Eugenia's case."
16720,I,N,F,P,"At this point she is not even trying to hide the fact that she is just bodychecking anymore. Zero effort. And saying that these summer clothes are fall clothes? Eugenia, most people live in the real world. We know how fall clothes look like. Or do you simply not give a single shit anymore at this point?

I'm sorry for you and I'm praying for your health. You probably just want to starve to death and can't understand why people get so angry. But look at how many people get sad, angry and frustrated. Do you think we are all just too dumb to get it? Most people here have been at a similar place. Don't you think we might know what we are talking about? 

I also don't know if you are serious about your ""I'm not doing anything bad""-stuff, but Eugenia... most people aren't in a constant haze or mania from starvation and can easily understand what is happening here. But I know you probably just can't see what's happening right now. You are throwing in our face what you can't seem to realize yourself. That evokes a lot of emotions."
16721,I,N,F,P,"Marina was traumatised, has abused substances and was diagnosed with a mental illness. She also was prescribed strong meds.

All 4 of those on their own can cause weird speech patterns.

For Eugenia it's mostly starvation. Watch her recovery Videos. She talks and acts normal."
16722,I,N,F,P,Some just invite it. Just like some women keep getting into relationships with men who abuse them.
16723,I,N,F,P,"While I'm generally critical of Eugenia that's a bullshit post.

I was also bullied at a public school for about four years. Severly bullied. No one saw anything, no one helped me, no one did anything, no one cared. People denied or had a ""different view"" of the situation. I also just pretended it didn't happen for a long time.

People get abused long-term all the time and nothing happens even though it should and even though it's pretty obvious. 

The kids in her class might feel ashamed now. They didn't help her. Maybe they forgot. Maybe they were the bullies. Why would they publicly admit that?

\+ most people aren't internet nerds who go on Reddit or something. Most just use WhatsApp and Instagram or something, if at all."
16724,I,N,F,P,Yea. :P
16725,I,N,F,P,"Yes, I feel bad about it. But I will most likely try to find a way to rationalize why it was indeed okay to not involve myself into conflict. Gotta keep the inner peace! :P"
16726,I,N,F,P,"Triangle Type for sure (3, 6, 9). 

6>9>3 is most likely in my opinion. Maybe that's even her Tritype.

But no idea about MBTI."
16727,I,N,F,P,"Some I leave for weeks.
Some I honestly never listen to and just forget."
16728,I,N,F,P,"Yea, SP 9 tends to be lazy about healthy sp choices and instead often prefers the lazy, easy, comfortable sp choices.

I think you are SP/SO. Outreaching members and constructing a life around society without being too obsessed about it tells me that you are so second. What you described as sx is also more social."
16729,I,N,F,P,K
16730,I,N,F,P,"I feel the same. I'm in Facebook groups where people - literally - believe in magic like in a movie. I don't want to judge and it seems to work for some, but to me it seems unrealistic.
I think there is a magical element to Witchcraft, but it's at like 10-20%. The rest is creating awareness, motivating yourself, taking action, setting intentions, reflecting...

I'm still new to Witchcraft though. My opinion might change. I definetely see magic happening with the moon and with tarot for example."
16731,I,N,F,P,"I do.
Obviously Fi in itself doesn't care about the sky.

Ne also doesn't really care about the sky, although it might acknowledge the sky every now and then. It's a very abstract function. It's not concerned with reality or with what's happening right now. It wants to figure out abstract connections and patterns and explore those.

Se on the other hand is concerned with the moment. With what's happening right now. The sky. The ground. An activity. Relaxing. Mountains. In form of thought or actual presence. Se users don't have to actually be present and many describe themselves as clumsy drramers. Although that's more so the case for Se second, Se dominant people are often pretty on.

So that's why many ISFPs mistype as INFPs.

Obviously INFPs can also care about the sky. But it's usually some kind of abstract, emotional connection. Like the now trending witchcraft = moon = what does it mean? Just posting pretty skies and mountains everywhere is heavy Se."
16732,I,N,F,P,I take a look at the cognitive functions and compare Ne to Se.
16733,I,N,F,P,I wish most people here would have that perspective. Most seem to think porn and fapping is the devil reincarnated and that those things need to be deleted from earth.
16734,I,N,F,P,Because I use porn in unhealthy ways at times. And because I enjoy some of the effects of NoFap.
16735,I,N,F,P,I'm the snowflake?
16736,I,N,F,P,"That's true, but it's not very natural for most INFPs. For me looking at the sky and getting out of my head is growth. :P"
16737,I,N,F,P,"No, my body is not a machine."
16738,I,N,F,P,"So you think sex is just for creating life?

We have more than enough sperm, you don't need to worry about that."
16739,I,N,F,P,"I am a super reflective person though. I will find reasons for everything, but they are the wrong reason. Or usually two problems will switch position. I will make a kinda easy to solve problem the main issue and the main issue will be seen as a easy problem.

Example: Being super tired, having no energy, feeling depressed. Instead of ""Oh, maybe because I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago and we still live together!"" or ""Oh, maybe because I will start a job-training soon!"" I will think ""Oh, it's because I don't eat healthy enough. Let's go to the supermarket!"". So I fix shit and fix shit, feel worse and worse... then one day I smoke for example a bunch of weed and it hits me. Crap. I have pushed away the main issue the whole time! Then I accept the main issue, feel the main issue and think about solutions. And I already feel much leighter."
16740,I,N,F,P,"Thank you, but this is me after 10 years of different kinds of therapy."
16741,I,N,F,P,"It's just so scary, because many feelings show you that some form of action needs to be taken. As a very basic example leaving the partner or quitting a job or ending a friendship."
16742,I,N,F,P,That's an easy one to blame.
16743,I,N,F,P,"It's especially ISFPs. I often can't understand why people get so fascinated by the sky. It's very Se, sometimes Si. As an Ne user I prefer abstract topics."
16744,I,N,F,P,"You don't seem to want to fully move in. It's often necessary to completely (!) distance yourself from am ex for at least a few years to fully move on.

Yes, it can be done differently with good reasons (children, animals, a house,...).
Yes, I was great friends with an ex or mine. At least 2 years after close to 0% contact!

How does unfollowing her feel like?"
16745,I,N,F,P,And the benefit of that would be what?
16746,I,N,F,P,"I get that, but I've been sober for over a year. And I mean close to completely sober. No coffee. No alcohol. Not much sugar. It didn't change much.

I don't struggle with stopping, but see no benefits. Moderate use every now and then seem to have the best pros/cons according to my experience."
16747,I,N,F,P,I have been in a wide variety of therapy. My awareness has improved drastically already. But it's not enough to lead a normal life!
16748,I,N,F,P,"Yea, that's good advice! :)"
16749,I,N,F,P,"I'm aware of that, that's why I said that there are ways to create and view porn without potentially harming anyone. :)

For example OnlyFans is starting to get bigger and bigger now with private, individual content creators. Many YouTubers are there for example. Collabing with other YouTubers, doing solo content and so on."
16750,I,N,F,P,"There are some good points here, let me add another perspective.

The SP 9 is the ""typical 9"". The 9 that likes to merge with activites. That can be work, Netflix, gaming, smoking weed, working out all day, eating. So instead of looking at your negative emotions you will open your fridge. Or put on that fun TV show. Or go to the gym. Whatever ""your"" activities are.

The Social 9 is usually the least 9ish to me personally. They can be quite airy, social, open and extroverted. Funny. They like to create a peaceul, positive social environment. And merge with the people around them to self-erase. 

The SX 9 puts a lot of attention towards being the perfect mate, again, through self-erasure. They might search for a very obsessed, strong or narcissistic partner. Someone with a lot of demands, so the SX 9 can just merge and self-erase. Gotta go the gym to look sexy for him. Gotta buy sexy clothes. Gotta clean the house. Gotta get into the same hobbies as he is. To the SX 9 it can be quite hurtful if the other person rejects merging, so they can actually be kinda demanding in a weird way, too.

Now, most 9s will relate to all 3 of those describtions. It's rare to have an actual blindspot. You just have to figure out what you usually automatically do. That can be so fucking obvious that it's hard to see.

I'm usually conciously more concerned about social and sexual, but I'm a SP 9. That's what I automatically do."
16751,I,N,F,P,Go fir it!!! :)
16752,I,N,F,P,"Actually I think I'm kinda sexy, so that doesn't work for me... :D"
16753,I,N,F,P,"It's okay to relapse. <3

Actually it's kinda beautiful that you are aware of the reason why you relapsed. So next time you know what to do, right? :)

I also relapse for the same reason by the way. Boredom. Resisting the boredom instead of actually doing something with it. I think even just honestly observing the boredom could already help. Usually I try to ""kill"" my boredom through boring activites, like putting on some shitty boring stream. That makes me relapse."
16754,I,N,F,P,So you think it's possible to live without fear and negative emotions?
16755,I,N,F,P,"Nice self-discovery there! :)

I can relate to that story in a way. I started my Enneagram journey typing as a 4w5 sx/sp, lol. I also was super introverted, withdrawn, had social anxiety, wanted to be alone all day... and thought that it just makes sense to be social last then. Turns out I'm sp/so and that social is even my playground area. :P 

It was just puberty, being unhealthy, mental illness..."
16756,I,N,F,P,Coooooooooooool
16757,I,N,F,P,"Yes, most things can cause issues in individuals.

Sure, there are a lot of issues in the porn industry. But that's also not porn's fault. There are ways to create and view porn without potentially harming anyone."
16758,I,N,F,P,"Why do you think I try to do that?

We are human beings. There will always be highs and lows. Fear comes and goes. Hate comes and goes. Shame comes and goes. It's wonderful and beautiful to find ways to cope, but again, it's delusional to think one can stay free from fear. It just hits harder and sneakier if you deny that."
16759,I,N,F,P,"Oh that's very detailed, I don't really know. I usually talk about tritypes in general, differentiating between cores. But differentiating between 2nd and 3rd fix is something I have no experience with."
16760,I,N,F,P,"Yea, Instagram is very sexual. Sex sells."
16761,I,N,T,P,"Out of morbid curiosity, I'd like to know too

Like, Hylics is niche as it is, hylics + nsfw? Probably seen once in a millennium"
16762,I,N,T,P,"Imagine if through a bit of elbow grease you can tame these and ride them, making for some very intense PvP with friends"
16763,I,N,T,P,"But... But if you put anything in the pockets that is heavier than, idk, a piece of paper, it'll weigh it down and won't be as flow-y as before

16765,I,N,T,P,"I dead ass don't remember Dio demanding filicide

Also, I kinda get where your friend is coming from with him being poor, but c'mon. If I remember correctly some of part 5's cast were poor and they didn't try to dominate the world + be evil >:c

16776,I,N,T,P,Awww it looks like a lil Pokemon! Thank you so much for drawing the stand
16777,I,N,T,P,"Yea, I thought it was like most stand moves, the user doesn't necessarily have to say it to ""activate"" it

In Jotaro's case, maybe he thinks its like a direct trigger?? Like yea he can just *do it* but maybe it feels stronger when he says it, idk"
16778,I,N,T,P,"If I remember correctly it's like a girl cheating on her bf or something like that

So not very wholesome"
16779,I,N,T,P,"To be fair, she has daddy issues with Jotaro so she ain't exactly in the right state of mind

Not off the walls, mind you, but I don't think Jolene had a very straight moral code or something like that, y'know?"
16780,I,N,T,P,"My IB coordinator used to say ""Don't you dare send me an email on weekends. I have a family too y'know""

but also said

""Guys, come on... If you're having trouble, you can shoot me an email before monday""

anyways he wasn't a very good teacher overall and got blacklisted by my old school"
16781,I,N,T,P,"I really like her, she felt like a tragic hero of sorts after I read her book

It felt like her life fell apart ever since she had Brokenkit, or maybe it began when she was a medicine cat

16782,I,N,T,P,"The secret is porn addiction

Never sucked a dick until I had my first bf a few years back and he was convinced I already had some experience

No, no, I'm merely a lonely female with access to the internet"
16783,I,N,T,P,"I used to do this thing where I would just write absolute nonsense in a word doc just so that it ""sounded"" like I was actually typing out an essay in class, and the teacher didn't bother checking our screens

Cue to a week later the teacher asks me to review the essay I submitted with her and dead ass right in the middle of the whole thing was written ""damn I hope she didn't catch me looking at memes""

Folks, the lesson is at least skim before submitting"
16784,I,N,T,P,"Whenever I'm hit with something like ""you have no reason to be x,y or z"" I hit them back with

""damn bro, I know this is gonna sound crazy but I feel things that are different to you! Wacky am I right?! You dunno what I think or feel cuz believe it or not, I'm not physically connected to you nor are you inside my head! Wow crazy how people are different ain't it?!""

Works most of the time"

Not gonna lie tho, part 1 & 2 *can* feel like a drag if you wanna dive head first into the punchy ghost aspects of part 3 and onwards"
16788,I,N,T,P,"another point: who the fuck would even admit to rape?! If a man (or women) were to explain it in their eyes, it would be sex but the other person was reluctant or ""playing hard to get"""
16789,I,N,T,P,"I've been told growing up that I'm not obliged to help anyone (with mental illness) and while that is very true, that never ever excuses the type of people OP described, or the people you just described.

In my opinion, people should be supportive (not an improvised psychiatrist, but rather a shoulder to cry on) or do nothing at all. 

There's a god damn reason that its call mental ILLNESS, its something that takes control over you and makes you think things that aren't true. People who don't understand this simply won't be able to help those with mental illness at all"
16790,I,N,T,P,"This reminded me of yesterday

My mom was scolding me for leaving a CD on the floor and that I'll break it and I was like ""dude I ain't gonna break it cuz I know its on the floor, it's been in that exact same spot for a week"""

I typed her that way as because she always shown a lot of power and masculinity, and she seems to enjoy the technique of her art that felt like a Ti way rather than an express myself way. just my opinion. Anyway performers I type as esfp are Christina Aguilera, Lizzo."

16825,I,N,F,P,Yea I want to downvote this (I didn’t)

16842,I,N,F,P,My handwriting tends to be kind of lazy too xD I had the idea other infps have really neat handwriting
16843,I,N,F,P,Wtf that’s me
16844,I,N,F,P,"I feel so too, I think it can unconsciously shape what I think about types though it’s just what
people talk about on Reddit and things might not be so irl. I’m not sure."
16845,I,N,F,P,"These are all good things, seems unnecessary to create a ‘divide’ among people because of these values."
16846,I,N,F,P,"Yeah I regret that too, but this was still a connection that I cherish looking back. Life’s odd huh."
16847,I,N,F,P,"I don’t remember how he smelt like, it was quite a while ago haha. He cute tho."
16848,I,N,F,P,"I think perhaps visible and non visible panic maybe, Si-Ne is more expressive and relate-y. Se Ni is more like my body is disintegrating but I got this mountain to climb (and so I'm working on/suffering through it)."
16849,I,N,F,P,Ambivert abstract attentive ambivalent  -assertive
16850,I,N,F,P,I actually never heard that one before! I thought SJs are all good and bondy with each other. I have heard ENTJs hate each other though.
16851,I,N,F,P,I thought he said Boo and I got confused
16852,I,N,F,P,Is that michelle obama in INTJ?
16853,I,N,T,J,"There are political subreddits if you'd like to have a political conversation, but as I'm sure you know those almost always devolve into a divisive screaming match. I go to the Gus and Eddy Podcast and it's related subreddit to avoid these things, because its hard to support your boys when there's a political division."
16854,I,N,T,J,"You shouldn't just throw the word fascism around. You guys are the one toppling statues, I'm just waiting for you guys to start burning books and gassing the white people."
16855,I,N,T,J,Why?
16856,I,N,T,J,I agree. Subjective morality has far too many flaws. r/INTJChristians
16857,I,N,T,J,"Hold up there chump, you just posted something overtly political"
16858,I,N,T,J,It looks like they were racing and neither wanted to stop at the light
16859,I,N,T,J,"First one is a garbage truck, flies as in the bug flies"
16860,I,N,T,J,Thats not the reason they wont be passing on genes
16861,I,N,T,J,If it's inevitable why worry about it?
16862,I,N,T,J,"Look at it this way guys, if Gus and Eddy hang now and one of em dies, we wont EVER have them on set again. That'd be horrible, and it's highly unlikely that either would die, but is that a chance you're willing to pressure them into taking? Get off their cheeks and SUPPORT your BOYS."
16863,I,N,T,J,And if we're blind?
16864,I,N,T,J,"I ask this question to everyone that I will probably be running into on a regular basis, blue is by far the most common, with green and purple at second and black and red close behind at third. Rarely hear anyone say orange white or yellow"
16865,I,N,T,J,"I freaking love the album, but you have to have the right mindset. Very few of the songs on there are boppy and fun to listen to"
16866,I,N,T,J,Lol
16867,I,N,T,J,"You guys seem to have some weird idea that if you value one thing over another, it’s ok to destroy the other thing. I value life over property, but I also value property. That’s why I don’t like to see things burned down. I value human life over dog life, I’m not gonna go kill dogs. 

COVID-19 is fatal. The main difference here is that the people at the Trump rally are taking their lives into their own hands, whereas the “peaceful protesters” are ripping property from other’s hands. I’d rather not get into a debate about who’s doing worse things, both sides are screwy, but we can at least accept the idea that BOTH sides are screwy can’t we?"
16868,I,N,T,J,"No she could, since it’s a law and someone could break it. Don’t need to have broken the law to rule on it."
16869,I,N,T,J,"Usually yes, but it’s self evident in this case."
16870,I,N,T,J,"Ah, they were more willing to burn down buildings than spread a disease pretty much everyone survives? You’re right, they are good people."
16871,I,N,T,J,What’s braver- cursing the president or supporting him on a platform that would try to S.W.A.T. you for doing so?
16872,I,N,T,J,"Woah, Trump is holding a “peaceful protest?” Weird."
16873,I,N,T,J,"Then the exact same thing applies to if they didn't own a gun. If you don't own a gun why should you get to judge a case on guns? 

The main difference of why your analogy doesn't work is that cocaine is illegal while owning a gun is not. Of course someone breaking the law would want to make that law not a law to avoid it's consequences."
16874,I,N,T,J,Seems the only way is to vote for him
16875,I,N,T,J,"Oh yeah! I heard about that, I go to college the town over"
16876,I,N,T,J,Why was Missouri trending?

16881,I,N,T,J,"The will and ability to work to afford to buy a phone case. It fell out of my pocket on a bike ride gogin nearly 25 mph downhill and smacked concrete, still nothing."
16882,I,N,T,J,"Alexander the great was a trillionaire, sorry to burst your bubble. 

Also socks exist to keep the insides of you shoe cleaner on a day to day basis, so putting a sock in the shoe is kinda weird right?"
16883,I,N,T,J,How do you know that the bed isnt just whale sized?
16884,I,N,T,J,"1. Antifa's riots are unacceptable, completely regardless of their policies.

2. Women shouldn't have any rights. (That's obviously a joke, I don't think any decent human being is against women's equal rights, so it's not a plus in your ""good person"" column).

3. I don't know what salary has to do with any of this. For all I know you are a drug dealer, just because you make more money doesn't mean you're a good person."
16885,I,N,T,J,A
16886,I,N,T,J,"Me and my conservative friend around out liberal friend when RBG died:

Our liberal friend when Ron Paul had a stroke: ""I laughed so hard, but I wish it had happened to Rand Paul, or better yet, Trump instead."""
16887,I,N,T,J,"You address one point and conviently leave the other point alone?

If the looter was gonna loot and thought he'd need a gun, he'd get a gun, even if it was illegal. The law abiding gun shop owner would then have nothing to defend himself with. 

And besides, when the looter is caught then they lose their ability to loot more or legally obtain firearms, until they get their bail payed for to get back out there are start looting again. 

Just because someone or some organization is doing what they think helps doesnt mean it actually helps. That's nonsense.

One party is actively doing damge to the small business, the other isn't. And I havent even looked up anything, so I'm just ASSUMING that there isnt a relief fund for private businesses set up by the Republicans, that very well could be a thing."
16888,I,N,T,J,Oh thats golden
16889,I,N,T,J,You mean besides protect their rights to bear arms for the past few decades and not bailing out/releasing the people who looted in first place? I guess not much
16890,I,N,T,J,I am INTJ
16891,I,N,T,J,Philosophy? Would that be humanities or social science?
16892,I,N,T,J,He also left the lid on for far longer than the other times
16893,I,N,T,J,"So you, an INTJ, let your emotions get in the way of efficiency??

The only reason I said anything isn't because you wanted precise definitions, it's because you were being jerky about INTJ. There was no reason to leave such a snide, aggressive, demeaning, haughty comment. I couldn't care less if you wanted to vent your pet peeve, but that's no reason to be sk backhanded."
16894,I,N,T,J,"That may well be, but why would you, an INTJ, efficient machine, waste time bickering over precise definitions, especially if you understood what was being communicated?"
16895,I,N,T,J,"Oh get out of here with that backhanded bs. 

""OdD, iNtJs gEnEraLlY kNowN hOw rEseArcH wOrKs..."" If you're gonna take the time to insult someone, spell it right. 

And besides, the rest of us knew what he meant because INTJ's are typically deducive and can read context clues. What is being communicated matters more to us than how it's being communicated, and through the use of context clues, most others knew exactly what was being communicated, except you."
16896,I,N,T,J,I was there! Best concert I've ever been too!
16897,I,N,T,J,"Thats not something I considered, but thats a possibility. The youngest you can carry anywhere in the states is 19, most places requiring a license and/or the age of 21. Constitutional carry says you need not a license and be only 19 years of age.

I figured she was in a state where she had to go through a rigorous licensing process, but your assumption makes more sense"
16898,I,N,T,J,Where tf does she live? Move to a state with constitutional carry laws!

16903,E,N,T,P,Puoi parlare di Milano - Torino un cocktail storico che si chiamava cosi perché i due ingredienti erano vermouth(che veniva da Torino) più campari(Milano) due liquori italiani famosissimi nel mondo. Che poi con aggiunta di gin è diventato negroni un cocktail che conosciamo tutti ormai.
16904,E,N,T,P,It's still a shitty food but does not look sad made by someone with a chronic depression at least
16905,E,N,T,P,I don't know about you but i find it somehow cringe
16906,E,N,T,P,"Same shit pretty much, no?"

16910,E,N,T,P,Let's see how it's going to be optimized for every phone
16911,E,N,T,P,It wasn't that much of his fault those 7 goals he was good against Germany as well
16912,E,N,T,P,FARC had tanks? How was it possible?
16913,E,N,T,P,You're basically contradicting yourself because INFJ's have high Fe as well and they dont tend to show their emotions that much
16914,E,N,T,P,I mean you can still target some most important figures to make them weaker but going into the war would bring too many innocent deaths
16915,E,N,T,P,And how many civilians would die in this conflict? And even if kill them all there will be always someone who will be glad to take their place.
16916,E,N,T,P,Or maybe the material is more elastic than you think
16917,E,N,T,P,How would they sell them tanks? From across the Atlantic? If they wanted tanks i bet it would be easier to buy them through some corrupt politicians.
16918,E,N,T,P,Not just you for sure
16919,E,N,T,P,Secondo me OP voleva trollare tutti scrivendo il titolo in inglese..
16920,E,N,T,P,If they should not have lost against machi then g2 should not have lost against them as well.. i really don't know what you're trying to say here
16921,E,N,T,P,Everyone likes shitting on NA so I doubt it
16922,E,N,T,P,But he is noy getting that much of a play time right now.. Why?
16923,E,N,T,P,Well i guess the brexit is the answer how deep does it go
16924,E,N,T,P,What a scum
16925,E,N,T,P,Some games are unwinnable i agree but still you can achieve high enough win rate in order to climb
16926,E,N,T,P,Even if you're Zed and you win your lane hard and able to snowball your advantage to bot side or top
16927,E,N,T,P,This extreme example if your adc is udyr.. this is straight up trolling.
16928,E,N,T,P,Team comps don't matter that much in soloq especially in lower ranks
16929,E,N,T,P,We cannot know for sure depends also on the player so you have to calculate the medium wage
16930,E,N,T,P,They are better at focusing on being a joke of a team

16932,E,N,T,P,"Man, watching jankos graves and selfmade's is like two completely different champions..."
16933,E,N,T,P,In Mexico mortality rate is at 10% percent though which is really odd
16934,E,N,T,P,Look like it's staged no need to overreact actually
16935,E,N,T,P,"Man, bjergsen is one of the owners of TSM he will be there until his retirement."
16936,E,N,T,P,They lost some territory before Russia started to actively supplying them and sending some of their troops since Ukraine didn't want to escalate it further  they stopped their advance.. also because two major cities where on the way Donetsk and Luhansk and it would have been bloody.
16937,E,N,T,P,http://imgur.com/a/PC2apfq not me for sure
16938,E,N,T,P,Flash is so essential that i think it would nerf some champions if they removed it
16939,E,N,T,P,"Man, i recently came back to playing after year and a half or even more..so i jumped right to ranks trying to climb,  i was nice to my team even when we were losing and i was the only carry, i tried to encourage them and shotcall.. wasn't flaming or complaining at all but that changed after some weeks lol.. games are just not fair sometimes with people throwing for non reason or intentionally picking shaco support, sooner or later it kinda gets to you especially if you play to climb."
16940,E,N,T,P,Once a time I called the meeting two times cuz I saw  cyan venting and on the second meeting they decided to eject me.. he ended up winning that game
16941,E,N,T,P,Depends also on the boobs
16942,E,N,T,P,Memes need to be somewhat accurate
16943,E,N,T,P,Should have flashed to an iceberg then
16944,E,N,T,P,Spagna ovviamente che no.. bisogna vedere dove la situazione è sotto il controllo e non ci sarà bisogno di quarantena
16945,E,N,T,P,Ma si infatti non costa praticamente niente adesso specialmente se si tratta di voli e hotel
16946,E,N,T,P,come trovare i voli più low cost? che mi sto annoiando perecchio in questo periodo ci vado pure da solo da qualche parte

16948,E,N,T,P,Drinking tea on a balcony i think he is just embracing the meme
16949,E,N,T,P,Find some activity that forces you to approach and speak to people
16950,E,N,T,P,Just google cognitive functions test
16951,E,N,T,P,Men who are talking about their problems tend to be perceived negatively by a society cuz this is considered something that only a weak person would do which leads then isolation and futher depression
16952,E,N,T,P,I think assassination is something more targeted at specific person for specific reasons
16953,I,N,T,P,"You'll get better at it the more you wear it, and depending on your skin tone some products won't work. I have brown skin and tbh finding a setting powder is hard for me without looking like a clown. Some eyeshadows arent as pigmented as others, make sure to get the right products"
16954,I,N,T,P,AWWW THIS IS CUTE
16955,I,N,T,P,Yeah why

16959,I,N,T,P,INTP definitely lol
16960,I,N,T,P,What about INTP females
16961,I,N,T,P,"18 year old me trying to keep my life on track, keep good habits, stop procrastinating

My mbti test telling me im an INTP"
16962,I,N,T,P,Same
16963,I,N,T,P,It scares me how accurate this is
16964,I,N,T,P,"You should get a bolster pillow, it's really common in where i live to sleep with one. It's really like I'm cuddling somebody"
16965,I,N,T,P,I have an exam too tomorrow (university entrance exam) which is kind of a big deal and here i am looking at memes
16966,I,N,T,P,It is
16967,I,N,T,P,"I've never heard someone says ""stop barking"" in an argument LMAO HILARIOUS"
16968,I,N,T,P,Bruh moment
16969,I,N,T,P,What about perry the platypus
16970,I,N,T,P,Someone should make it asap
16971,I,N,T,P,Bad meme
16972,I,N,T,P,"Karen is the ENTP
The manager is the INTJ
duh"
16973,I,N,T,P,INTPs are also called incels
16974,I,N,T,P,Just INTP things
16975,I,N,T,P,"Sometimes I say ""You're not ugly, you're just broke"" to feel better about myself"
16976,I,N,T,P,"Oooh I used to read stories a lot. It's great, but ngl cant get off to it anymore ajdkdks i need more 😂 and yeah phone sex does pretty much that. And it could get pretty awkward if your partner sucks at dirty talking. But it's pretty nice to fill that void of intimacy though. Honestly it's phone sex>porn>audios for me"
16977,I,N,T,P,I second that
16978,I,N,T,P,I love this energy man
16979,I,N,T,P,"POTENTIAL INCEL LMAO 

yes that might be true 😳"
16980,I,N,T,P,"I know how you feel, my sex drive is pretty high and I'm a virgin. It sucks. I usually just masturbate to porn, but if I'm THAT horny and need intimacy from a guy I'll just have phone sex lol. There's an alternative from phone sex though, there's videos in youtube that consist of just audios of men dirty talking and it's pretty hot to get off to. The sudden realization after you came that you're so pathetic you dj-ed your clit to a random talking guy on youtube is what's kinda shitty"
16981,I,N,T,P,"Today I was queueing in a store. There was a guy infront of me and I think he didn't see me. He moved back, STEPPED ON MY TOES. I WAS USING SANDALS. MY UNPROTECTED NAKED TOES. And I'm the one who said sorry. Idk it's like an automatic response"
16982,I,N,T,P,"It's illogical that people follow it to some extent, even brainwashed by it. And they're convinced that th almighty god do exist because it was written in a script 2000 years ago. However, I like learning the history behind it. How Indo-European culture has a huge part with polytheistic religions in ancient greece, India, etc. And semitic culture with monotheistic religions. Discovering all the roots behind it is just so fascinating to me"
16983,I,N,T,P,"As an INTP, I felt this"
16984,I,N,T,P,LMAO I cannot read that with a straight face
16985,I,N,T,P,"Dude that's pretty accurate. I act like the problem I have is nonexistent all the time. Maybe to avoid anxiety that I'll get if I always think about it, idk. It's subconscious shit"
16986,I,N,T,P,INTP-A
16987,I,N,T,P,This hits home
16988,I,N,T,P,How did you change your face shape girlll
16989,I,N,T,P,I agree. Literally everyone on twitter is like that I'm so done
16990,I,N,T,P,"That's great man, happy for you! :)"
16991,I,N,T,P,"I have the same problem. Kind of. My upper lip area is dry, textured, and flaky sometimes. Not to mention the hyperpigmentation i get from constantly scratching it. I've been using niacinamide serum and it's been working nicely to reduce the dryness and the flakiness. It doesn't have a flaky and rough texture anymore. Not dry at all."
16992,I,N,T,P,That is just too cruel
16993,I,N,T,P,"Exactly. And they don't realize that. Indian people praising each other if their babies are light skinned, partners are lightskinned, etc and it's sickening to hear as a dark skinned person. Especially when it's your parents commenting negative shit on your skin color. I'm a girl so they always tell me to lighten it up with fair and lovely, turmeric, milk, literally everything to make it look more ""beautiful"" it's been like that since I was a child and I'm still working past it learning to love my skin tone but boi it's hard"
16994,I,N,T,P,"I also didn't ask to be born and a lot of the times wish I was never been born, but for some reason I always, always feel guilty for leeching. Sometimes I just feel bad asking them for money, don't know why lol. My parents aren't broke we're at least a middle class family. I was offered to go to an expensive international school by my dad but I declined because of the shit load of money gonna be spent on me and went to a shitty public school instead, probably my biggest regret but god knows how guilty I'd felt if I accepted his offer"
16995,I,N,T,P,"And Indian women, I swear hair grows back literally 0.1 seconds. And the hair follicles are thick as fuck."
16996,I,N,T,P,"I always walk down the hallways in my school without greeting teachers or anyone cause It always end up being awkward, the next thing is 3 teachers called me out and basically scold me, telling me how incredibly arrogant I was for not greet or even smile at them. One of them even noticed I'm only friendly to 1 teacher and shame me for it, telling me I was playing favorites.... Thank god I'm done with this bs"
16997,I,N,T,P,How is it sad? if anything it's great to see people's mindset progressing over a biological trait that has always been ingrained on us just for the sake of our genes to spread
16998,I,N,T,P,"How can she not think for a clear second how hard it will be for her son to thrive, to go through life with a condition like that, to find someone who is willing to take care of him besides his mom. If only she's rational enoug to think about the costs and pain instead of being stupidly selfish like that"
16999,I,N,T,P,"Girl... I have the same problem, I just cant be slightly picky and expect an attractive guy to like me. Looks are out of the book, if he likes me he's my type"
17000,I,N,T,P,"Things like that stings deeply, I still remember facing those behaviors is elementary and middle school, even sometimes in highschool. Now I can't tell if people meant it when they compliment my physical features, it's always gonna be ironic in my head"
17001,I,N,T,P,"I'm currently in the same position as you, finished high school and not 100% sure what field to study afterwards. I thought about biotech for awhile considering my love for bio but the truth is there's not enough jobs for it and it's not really high paying as far as I know. Biochem is probably a better option."
17002,I,N,F,J,Being able to help other people but not being able to help yourself. Or being conflicted between following your heart but being logical. A forever swaying pendulum

17017,I,N,F,J,"Let's be honest here. Every subreddit has its collection of toxic people. As long as there's internet, there's toxicity"
17018,I,N,F,J,Oh cool. A couple small details I didn't catch. Thanks for pointing those out to me and being respectful about it.p
17019,I,N,F,J,Sure. And that's your opinion.
17020,I,N,F,J,"I appreciate the feedback and the expected attacks from closed minds. Korrasami is cannon and if that's what the creators wanted with the subtleties of Nick's guidelines, that's fine with me. I guess it would make more sense to me if it was made more flat out and developed on screen, like the creators originally wanted. Thanks to those who informed me on the creators' intentions. At the end of the day, we're all fans of LOK and should agree to disagree."
17021,I,N,F,J,Sure. That's your opinion
17022,I,N,F,J,"I'm not against the LGBTQ community by any means and my opinion about their ""romantic"" relationship has nothing to do with homophobia. So Korra and Asami ending up in a romantic relationship made little sense to me in the aspect of how they never really formed enough of a relationship in general to both start seeing each other in a different light in such a short amount of time. With all the drama and action that happened in the last season, they barely had time to form that bond. It just felt kind of random and forced. Am I alone here? Feel free to dislike if you disagree. Just curious"

17024,I,N,F,J,All while sporting PewDiePie merch 😂👌
17025,I,N,F,J,I always thought he altered his voice for identity protection reasons but nope. That's his normal voice. I gotta see what this guy looks like
17026,I,N,F,J,"Long hair really suits you ❤️ I would maybe go to a hairdresser at least once just to give it a try. They're usually really good but if it doesn't work out, you'll know not to go back (at least to that particular hairdresser)"
17027,I,N,F,J,Anyone else here from watching PewDiePie play?
17028,I,N,F,J,That cake tho
17029,I,N,F,J,No no this is me to omg

17046,I,N,F,J,Or hotels

17048,I,N,F,J,You're on to something
17049,I,N,F,J,So does this mean Heehoo is a creepypasta? 🤔

And then naturally you translate your own ideas best, so you end up carrying most of it."
17053,I,N,T,P,"No wayy. My dad is ISTP and he's great. Mostly chill, and we get along well. My mom is ISFJ and, uh no. She's caring and I love her and all, but she's also really toxic, lots of bad ISFJ traits. I get along fine with ISFJs when they're at an equal level with me. In positions of authority like a parent, they can be controlling (they have this world view based on their experiences and traditions that to them is the right thing, and everything else is judged), manipulative, overly emotional.  

My mom is never be able to take criticism and everything is *disrespect* to her, even tho she's the verbally abusive person. I know of another ISFJ parent (my friend's) like that, and you might say it's intuitive bias, but the friend is an ISFJ and has the same issues. He has negative ISFJ traits too, but it's all fine when they're friends, because they're at an equal level so you can handle it, and be upfront. When they have authority over you though? Gosh it's frustrating, for me anyway."

17055,I,N,T,P,"I used to unconsciously find myself taking charge of projects because I suggest lots of ideas, and more so when I don't think the others are good at the job- which is often. That has lead to people thinking I was being bossy, so now I just let the others do what they want. 

Sometimes it's really hard to watch though."

17067,I,N,T,P,What?

17069,I,N,T,P,Or maybe some of them really are just stuck up snowflake INFJs.

17092,I,N,T,P,"> Patrick Star is the first one in the series to notice the clear inconsistency behind the natural principles of their ocean. He questions why there is even fire in the first place, when they live underwater. 

&#x200B;

>He is too oblivious of his own feelings and he has weird and unusual way of thinking. I mean he has a lot of thoughts in his head, it's just that he probably can't come up with the words to express them. Patrick is more in the head than in the heart. He is stupid by the standard of society but he's actually smart in a weird way. He is a clear Ne user that's why he always comes up with imaginative non-sense thoughts that he shares with Spongebob like ""The inner machinism of my mind is an enigma."". It's just weird but somehow it's true... I mean how can a stupid starfish come up with things like that? Oh.. and also.. Patrick is cunning and mean towards Spongebob sometimes. Like in the Dumped episode. He ""steals"" Gary from Spongebob in a subtle way. He is stupid, yes, but how can he play with Spongebob's feelings like that? rather than supporting Sponge? It hurts Spongebob's feelings but Spongebob is too innocent to know what his best friend does subtly to him. So yeah, Patrick uses his brain more than his heart. He has dominant Ti, proven by how weird his thoughts and cunning his actions are towards innocent guy. 

That was the explanation for Ti on there

17167,E,N,F,P,Maybe the person meant it as you stop your busy day and look at the simple stuff around us like the raindrops on the car and the fact you find it fascinating is deep bcz most ppl don’t even notice or can appreciate those.
17168,E,N,F,P,"I don’t like this 
It’s too long to explain but I don’t agree with this"
17169,E,N,F,P,I don’t think it’s luck i think bcz when you’re high your mind is more imaginative and everything you think feels like reality so if you use the sub you would actually believe it’s the reality and the belief would be strong enough to stay.

17183,E,N,F,P,Oh what in the world you look so different
17184,E,N,F,P,Uwuuuuu
17185,E,N,F,P,I saw your comment on the YouTube video hehe 👀

17202,I,N,F,P,"It’s hard to admit this but if William actually was attractive (as the writers intended him to be) I would’ve guiltily liked it. I mean it’s a step back but it’s just a show so it’s ok as long as you know what’s right or wrong yourself. Anyways, it doesn’t matter because the actor who played William played him in such a way that he probably is the least attractive person in the whole fucking series. I just couldn’t be convinced and it ruined the whole season for me."
17203,I,N,F,P,"It doesn’t really have the same effect when you blame Turks for being insecure when you do that under every single comment section. It looks like you are the one who is insecure, you know."
17204,I,N,F,P,I mean the people PKK kills the most are the Kurds. The people PKK hurts economically the most are the Kurds. Kurdish people are not terrorists they are the victims of PKK.

17206,I,N,F,P,No he hasn’t won against viper in any major tournament this year if I remember correctly
17207,I,N,F,P,I mean personally I don’t see much of a difference between a showmatch and a tournament. Funny enough mbl did won the huns war in Arabia in that sm.
17208,I,N,F,P,"There was a showmatch between them and capoch won that one but I can’t remember whether or not it was arabia, I think it was?"
17209,I,N,F,P,Don’t eat that one.
17210,I,N,F,P,"I’m a Turkish native speaker and honestly, as someone who learned both English and French later in life, I don’t think English is better at conveying emotions than French. But that’s super natural, I think.

I came to this conclusion myself when I realised when someone uses a cuss word in English, I feel nothing. But they were to say that same thing to me in Turkish, I’d probably get mad at them. It depends on the situation. In English though, there is no way I actually feel insulted the same way I do, regardless of the situation."
17211,I,N,F,P,I think that’s less about French and more about French not being your native tongue. Nothing will be like your native language.
17212,I,N,F,P,I don’t know about villese but liereyy definitely has style. His play style is the most aggressive in top 10 it’s super fun to watch him play.
17213,I,N,F,P,Capoch is to mbl what yo is to viper.
17214,I,N,F,P,"You say you acknowledge it but you do acknowledge nothing and just make excuses and try to play the devil’s advocate. 

Saying Armenia has less population then my bedroom sounds like a snark to me. Using their genocide in that context is disgusting as well. 

It’s obvious to me that you are delusional and I don’t have the energy and stomach to deal with it nor do I want to. Hopefully you’ll find your way and come to terms with the truth."
17215,I,N,F,P,"You don’t need to get snarky on me I do acknowledge my own country’s past. Obviously the same can’t be said for you. You can make excuses with “the facts” but the fact is Belgians that lived in the past took part in the genocide of black people, they exploited them, they stole from them, they did atrocious things to them and in the end they saw it as their right as a superior race, they are fully responsible for their actions. If you are a Belgian that lives today it’s your responsibility to acknowledge that."
17216,I,N,F,P,"Yeah the severing of hands is a bit extreme just continue doing the regular genocide like everyone else jeez! /s

You remind me a lot of my own countrymen that are always like but but... this but but... that when it comes to Armenian genocide but they are being brainwashed by the gov from a young age and generally don’t know any other language they can find resources to educate themselves well enough, what’s your excuse? You seem to have a lot of those, surely you’ll come up with one. Don’t tell me because I’m not interested."
17217,I,N,F,P,So you do acknowledge that Belgians of the past are fully responsible for the genocide?
17218,I,N,F,P,The way you continue blaming black people for their own genocide disgusts me too much I can’t.
17219,I,N,F,P,"This sounds like a bunch of words lined up together to redirect the blame to them. There are some flattery squeezed as well like “Belgians are  not lazy!!”. It’s really hard to take it seriously especially since Belgians helped a genocide happen in Rwanda not that long ago. 

Making excuses for yourself doesn’t change that yes they saw themselves as superior to black people as a race, they took advantage of them, they did atrocious things to them and yes they were ok with it since they thought black people were inferior. Belgian people of *today* can’t be held responsible of course, as long as they acknowledge the situation as it is and don’t make excuses for what happened like “they themselves did the selling!!”. It’s not a negotiation it’s exploitation, you still exploit their lack of knowledge of what was really happening to them at the time to put the blame on them when you blame them for their own genocide. It doesn’t work that way."
17220,I,N,F,P,I mean most people were ok with slavery and justified themselves by saying they were racially superior at the time so it’s not like the gov back then was a ray of sunshine.

17232,I,N,F,P,Same.

17234,I,N,F,P,I agree. Yo always plays on another level when he is against viper but doesn’t show the same performance against basically anyone else.
17235,I,N,F,P,I always had a thing for vespas and I’d like to see annabeth riding one.

17238,I,N,F,P,"Well I never said that it’s justified myself? I said it’s understandable and I wouldn’t judge the victims if they tried to do something about it if the justice system fails them. It often fails them but rarely anyone does something about it anyways. 

What i feel isn’t relevant but I feel worse if an assaulter just gets to slip from the law enforcement and possibly finds it as another reason to continue (which again happens all the time, everywhere) than when a victim tries to make life hell for that assaulter and tries to prevent them from staying/reaching positions of power, yes."
17239,I,N,F,P,I mean it has to be really bad. Watching your lives work being utterly destroyed.
17240,I,N,F,P,The movies are trash but tbh that never bothered me that much.
17241,I,N,F,P,"Personally I live in a country where law enforcement is an open joke and when it comes to sexual assault, I think that’s pretty much the state in the rest of the world as well. Obviously it’s never ok to kill people (and it horrifies me how it can be an actual sentence given in some countries) and it never even crossed my mind it’s all you. Making people around the assaulters aware and trying to prevent assaulters from reaching positions of power, trying to make life hell for them etc. that was what I was thinking. I’m not going to stand here and judge a victim that has been wronged by the law if they chose to go down that route. I think that’s completely understandable."
17242,I,N,F,P,"Yes but you are mixing the situations, stop with the whataboutism. What I’m talking about is one-on-one. Even in countries where corruption isn’t that much of an issue people in powers positions will easily slip. It happens all the time. In fact it happens so much that people who get away with what they’ve done are the majority. 

There is no time and place where the law enforcement was without its faults and there never will be."
17243,I,N,F,P,"The problem with GOT is that it builds up to something just to shit on it for shock value, all the time. People just become frustrated and numb after a while but the writers aren’t good enough to tie it all up so they continue doing that. In Spartacus all the storylines followed through with amazing character growth and it was all done so seamlessly. It also has a comic-like style that makes it less serious but it’s doesn’t take away from it, just adds some relief and character."
17244,I,N,F,P,It has style. It looks like something out of a comics book. Beginning of season 1 is overkill but overall I really do like it.
17245,I,N,F,P,How will people change the justice system for good if they don’t take it into their hands though?
17246,I,N,F,P,Fleabag?
17247,I,N,F,P,If the justice system isn’t working then it’s completely understandable that people try to bring their own justice. And when it comes to victims of sexual assault justice system rarely works.

Eğer yetişkin olana kadar (18+) Türkiye’de doğup büyümedilerse Türk olarak görmüyorum zaten onları.

17251,I,N,F,P,Piper?
17252,I,S,F,P,"I can see that spin. 

She’s actually always been opposed to me getting governmental help. I used to consider signing up for disability due to mental illness when I started out with her. She suggested against it. Looking back, I liked that. As traumatized as I feel, I don’t feel mentally ill anymore. 

She’s also out-of-network. I used to have to send invoices to my dad’s health insurance provider and get reimbursed through him. I stopped because NC and am finding a good plan that will also reimburse for OON. I’m considering Sidecar, but their rates are competitive only after I’ve had less than 5 therapy visits during the past year. That’s the main reason I’m waiting."
17253,I,S,F,P,"I agree with this deep down. Every fearless fiber in me wants to share my experience with people who can relate. Whether in fiction or with real names, I don’t know, but I want to share it. It’s worth more to me than any check he can ever write. 

She encourages me to do that. But she believes I can speak out while also taking his money. I think she either doesn’t see how hard that is, or doesn’t care, because whatever happens to me, at least she’ll get paid. 

I’ve edited my question—she has never replied to him or contacted him in her life. Neither had he, before I started working with her. He wrote a comment on her public website and phoned her public number. 

She showed me the comment and played me the voicemail. He begged her in both to get me to come home. She 100% thinks I should not see him. 

Overall I feel she helps me except when it serves her not to, which isn’t often, but happens. I’m kind of on involuntary therapy break right now due to finances, so yeah. It’s gotten me thinking."
17254,I,S,F,P,Isn’t it? I thought it was just my trust issues.
17255,I,S,F,P,"No. Honestly I suggested that one to her myself because I was frustrated. She said, “I wouldn’t do that.”"
17256,I,S,F,P,"I always wished she would but I think that’s been unhealthy of me. I feel like she wants me to stop acting like I’m underprivileged, which is valid."
17257,I,S,F,P,"Yeah. To be fair, I don’t show her my strong feelings. I only get a little pouty and stubborn when she suggests it. I also get a little wishful and wide-eyed because yes I wish my dad would pay. Maybe she feeds off of that because she wishes it too. For her own benefit or mine, I don’t know. Or maybe she’s trying to get me to put my foot down, which is still strange."
17258,I,S,F,P,"Government making abusers pay, heck yes. And I’m sorry to hear about your dad. The income difference is painful because it keeps reminding you just how weak the so-called bond is. Maybe the difference remains only until we let go of the pain.

I would hope it’s a misguided justice thing with my therapist where she feels right about making him pay. I really hope it’s not her sacrificing my peace for her pay. That sucks.

I’ve been worried all this time about bringing it up because I feel so upset about it. But thanks to you guys, I see that my feelings are not just valid but also helpful in this case. So I can be more firm rather than upset when I tell her."
17259,I,S,F,P,I like this idea. I just gotta do it.
17260,I,S,F,P,"I am so sorry. That sounds painful. I am so proud of you for staying NC. It’s tough, but so obviously the best choice when it comes down to it. 

When I visited my family, my siblings started “joking” about me being left out of the will. It hurt me more than I thought it would, and I knew they’d get even worse if I told them to stop. That was why I went hard-NC. I realized that even the will isn’t something I could count on. Their kindness isn’t a thing. So why try? I don’t anymore. 

They contact me through an old email I don’t use anymore. I check it every four months to make sure no one has died. That’s it. I would hope they’ll tell me. They’re so loud about getting married and getting sick that I take it for granted that they’ll tell me about someone’s death. 

He has written to me before that he won’t disown me because our religion forbids it. He was hoping to soften me toward the religion. I know the religion forbids disowning except for apostasy, and I’m agnostic, but he doesn’t know that. I doubt he’ll disown me, but I’m finished counting on it. 

I’m done expecting anything from any of them. It’s too painful to expect a crumb of kindness and get discarded. He would definitely try giving generously and then threatening to withdraw. That’s nothing because I know how to withdraw too. But he’s clever and always figures out the ways to best use the family against me. 

Life is better now than it was, but it is hard. Sometimes I still go into denial and feel like I’m making everything up. The only thing that keeps me sane is noticing how obviously better NC feels, which is sick because they’re your own family. So what they did must have been sick. It is.

I’m grateful for the internet and people I feel like I can relate with and talk to. Please take care of yourself as well. Our health is all we have in the end."
17261,I,S,F,P,"100% he would do that and I don’t get why she wants me exposed to that just so I have an easier time paying her? She helps me so much but that is odd to me. 

But then I have grown so much while knowing her. It could be worse, where she encourages me to contact him, which she doesn’t. But it could be better too, where she encourages me to cut everything off from him for good.

She says it can be healing for survivors to get retribution from their abusers, even without having to talk to them. Which might be true—if it was possible to get money from an abuser without paying a huge price."
17262,I,S,F,P,"She led me to see the worst of my trauma in the first place. She helped me stay away from a suicidal and manipulative ex who landed me in therapy. Then she urged me to stay NC when I wanted to visit my family for holidays. 

I didn’t heed her advice and had a horrible time with my family. I realized she was right about NC, so when pandemic struck, I buckled down and went hard NC instead of asking them for help. It was a good decision, but difficult.

She wants me to not visit them, and definitely not live with them... yet also maintain enough contact to be able to get money from them. Then handle the consequences afterward I guess. 

My therapist always sides with me, even when I don’t. Just this money thing is so confusing to me."
17263,I,S,F,P,"Thanks for your answer. I went full NC with my whole family this year. 

I did a WID private session once. The woman I got started talking about her past of pimping and crime. I got the feeling she didn’t think it was wrong. I’m a sex trafficking survivor and it scared me off. But that was a couple years ago so maybe I can try again."
17264,I,S,F,P,"Yes. As a sub and ex stripper, I was so underwhelmed by professional femdom. I thought it’d be easier and more empowering than stripping, but it was the same. Except now I wore black instead of pink. It was easier physically but harder emotionally than stripping. And I like getting exercise. Kink, especially sadism, sickens me. Past sexual trauma and confusion regarding it is the ONLY reason behind the ones that still arouse me."
17265,I,S,F,P,Yeah we got this 😤
17266,I,S,F,P,Yeah. It is kinda silly when I think about it. Thanks.
17267,I,S,F,P,Thanks. Means a lot.
17268,I,S,F,P,"Hey that makes sense, thank you."
17269,I,S,F,P,Ok :)
17270,I,S,F,P,Hot girl summer 💀
17271,I,S,F,P,I don’t think he will but yeah. I should go back to therapy.
17272,I,S,F,P,"It’s been almost 20 years and I have no proof. No one in my family believes me when it comes to the physical abuse everyone has experienced at his hands. I’m not even going to try with my sexual abuse. 

My father’s brother molested me too. My parents believe that one because my older sister also saw it. But no one did anything or talks about it.

My grandfather abused my father’s sister and mother too but never me or my siblings. I like to think my father will be the same way as he ages but yeah you never know."
17273,I,S,F,P,"They’re only residents right now and don’t make much more than I do yet. I don’t want to bum off them even when they do. I feel like it holds me back. Also emotion and religion wise they side with my parents and deny all abuse.

My older sister is infertile. She gets special treatment and is allowed to hold off on marrying altogether. She compensates by hyper-achieving.

My younger sister was going to get married this winter to a guy I didn’t think was right for her. I wasn’t going to attend and the engagement ended up falling apart."
17274,I,S,F,P,I am too. What were you going to advise?
17275,I,S,F,P,That’s a nice story. My father programmed singing out of me. I’d like to sing again.
17276,I,S,F,P,Thank you this means a lot.
17277,I,S,F,P,Those aren’t nachos.
17278,I,S,F,P,"I don’t know. A person’s worth to him ends when their use to him does. 

He barely talks to me anymore—just cordial invitations to family gatherings about twice a year. My mother does all the emotional emailing. 

So if I start “harming” his image, I fear he’ll stop ignoring me and actually harm me. But I don’t know. 

I wish I did. The confusion is almost harder than knowing for sure that he would do it. I don’t think he would?"
17279,I,S,F,P,"I’m glad you got him off of you. The best sympathy I’ve found is for MYSELF by ignoring these abusers as much as I can and by healing myself.

I live in a bad area of town and don’t own a car, so I ALWAYS carry my taser. When I have to walk home, I keep walking and stare straight ahead no matter what. I shut my mouth no matter how friendly a stranger sounds. 

Often they think I’m deaf. I’m sure a nasty character would use that. That’s why I always have my taser on ready and I stay on high alert. I’m not deaf by any means.

I have no business helping ANYONE change if THEY don’t want to change THEMSELVES first. I’m focused on being able to buy a car and lifting MYSELF up. Then I can help people who want to help themselves. Nothing or no one can drag me down. 

Terrible things happen to us all. Like you, I know that fact deep in my bones. It gives behavior like what we experienced NO EXCUSE. 

Recognizing that a behavior is not right is different than blaming it. Blame still makes the other person important, just in a different way. Anger means trying to change something, and when that doesn’t work, walking away, because no one is more important to you than YOU.

It’s not strong to never get mad, just like it’s not brave to never be afraid. It’s strong to make the right choices in the face of our rage and fear. And I would be enraged, if I were you. What you experienced should happen to nobody, and it still happened to you. Yeah, I would’ve maced the hell out of that guy.

I applaud your strength of character OP and strength in general. I’m so sorry you had to go through that."
17280,I,S,F,P,"I liked your answer on my question. Hey I can relate. Sounds like you’re a free spirit who has a tendency to get into sticky situations and have controlling exes :p that’s not me at all!

Covid has ruined so many people’s lives, especially those of nightclub workers. It sucks to lose our jobs. But it also inspired me to make a change. It’s been hard but I’m glad for it in the end.

Taking on more responsibility sounds like the worst thing ever to chill people like us. But for me, getting an office job was the best thing I’ve done for myself in a long time. 

It sounds terrible and dull—and it is—but it’s improved my life so much. I bum off of no one and my money worries are gone. 

My nightclub job used to be exercise enough in itself but now I have to exercise intentionally. It’s hard to set aside time like that. I’m starting out right now with daily walks but I’d like to move up to the kind of stuff I used to do. 

I’m still worried about attracting controlling friends, so I don’t go out much. But if my new practices become habits, which they will, I know I’ll be okay.

Looking back on my question you answered, people like you and me don’t have to take on huge responsibility if we don’t want to. But a stable job has been a healthy balance to my wildness. 

Now to change the job itself!"
17281,I,S,F,P,You’re growing!
17282,I,S,F,P,It is what it is. Good on you for protecting your mental health
17283,I,S,F,P,"It was funny to me because it was true but I see it was non sequitur. Also kind of manipulative to drop a grenade like that and expect people to laugh. Ideally they would ignore you if they can’t laugh, but it’s not fair to expect people to zen out when you push them to behave in a way that suits you. When they walk into a racial discussion it’s different, and they should behave, but you walked into an unrelated discussion. Some people don’t care, and you can’t help them, but for most of us, the topic just hurts. I’m a woman of color and I laughed but I respect that not everyone can. It doesn’t mean we should shut up, absolutely not, it means we should speak up more, in our own world and not everyone else’s. Big topics belong in big arenas, our own arenas."
17284,I,S,F,P,Thank you! I just joined.
17285,I,S,F,P,I am in Florida. I’ll look into private party cars and keep saving up in the meantime.
17286,I,S,F,P,Yeah. I might have to. I can handle mundane and I’ll take draining. It’s the abusive customers who make me disappointed in myself for choosing this work. I’ll look into private party options for the car.
17287,I,S,F,P,"Thanks, I will have to look into this and other options besides dealerships"
17288,I,S,F,P,My credit is fair-good but I don’t want to finance anything. It makes sense that I shouldn’t borrow
17289,I,S,F,P,"I don’t know. I guess they were being smart. Thinking about it more, I don’t desperately need a car. I desperately want to quit my job."
17290,I,S,F,P,Do private party cars have Carfax or accident history checkup?

17305,E,N,F,P,i am an extrovert with social anxiety out the wazoo!
17306,E,N,F,P,Grand Finale is the only song i still actively listen to from Going Grey
17307,E,N,F,P,Hello Hello and Stop This Song have always been my favorites!
17308,E,N,F,P,had chills and was on the verge of tears the whole time
17309,E,N,F,P,it is one of the greatest travesties of our time that Crazy Girls did not get a music video. i have always said this
17310,E,N,F,P,"if anyone has a Danny Devito Phoebe Bridgers shirt they want off their hands, please dm me!"
17311,E,N,F,P,"yeah, it was different before, i remember it being just ""2015"" at one point. i wonder why she has left it up?"
17312,E,N,F,P,":') thank you friend, you don't know how encouraging this was to read. you're absolutely right, and i fully agree that if two people want to make it work, they can. i think a lot of my anxiety about it (if you don't mind me really oversharing for a second here) is because my ex, who i dated for two and a half years and was friends with for longer, ended things because we went long-distance and it made me feel like i was not worth it. it's incredibly kind, affirming and flattering that a guy i don't even know that well is willing to put in effort to keep talking to me after i leave. but i can't help but feel like if this guy who was my best friend and who i was with for a good chunk of time could decide that the extra effort wasn't worth it to be with me, then what's to stop the new guy from jumping to that same conclusion/thinking he made a mistake? i guess i'm not as over my breakup as i thought i was"
17313,E,N,F,P,"i'm moving out of state at the end of the week and feeling a lot about that. i still need to finish packing, and i'm going to miss my friends here a ton, but more than anything, i am thinking about this stupid guy i started seeing. we started talking a month ago and i was up front with him about leaving soon, but we still went out a few times and I don't regret it at all, but it is making it harder for me to leave. He said he would like to keep talking to me after I leave and see where things go. I'm trying to hold it loosely and be realistic and know that things might not go anywhere while also trying to be hopeful and not write myself out of things I want/self-sabotage. It's been a rough year since my last boyfriend broke up with me (because of distance, might I add), and every instinct in me is to bolt because it's scary to be known and seen! and what if he changes his mind? What if he already has??? It's too early in our correspondence to be \~official\~ with him or incredibly frank about my fears. I feel like I'm 15 again and I feel embarrassed that I care more about this than leaving my friends and family and the place I grew up"

17329,E,N,F,P,I feel personally attacked
17330,E,N,F,P,I feel that too. Part III definitely grew on me but I think I'm still in the grief of mourning my relationship that recently ended so Part I is still my favorite for sure.
17331,E,N,F,P,"wait you're not crazy, I remember that too. I think it was Portuguese cause I kind of feel like Brazil was in the username that posted it"
17332,E,N,F,P,"The Only Exception was what made me start to listen to them because it was on the radio all the time. then, a friend showed me Brick By Boring Brick and I became obsessed! I started listening to all their most popular ones (at the time) from there, like Careful, Ignorance, Decode, Misery Business and Pressure. if you like more pop leaning stuff, you'll like their most recent two albums, but if you are more into heavier alternative, you'll like their first 3. everything is good though :)"
17333,E,N,F,P,ugh actually that sounds familiar and i kind of remember it being in that interview..... maybe they edited out for some reason?
17334,E,N,F,P,"that makes complete sense, thank you so much :)"
17335,E,N,F,P,i mean.... the post is about the wedding? why should OP go into detail about how their family is handling Bob and Kate's relationship when this post is specifically about the wedding
17336,E,N,F,P,are you sure it's the Behind the Brand interview? I just listened to it and i didn't catch that
17337,E,N,F,P,"I think you could've reacted more kindly, but I don't think you're the asshole here. Also, I am pretty sure I weighed that much when I was 17 and I'm the same height as you! If you live a healthy lifestyle I wouldn't be concerned about your weight :)"

17344,E,N,F,P,woah what song(s) is that in?

17349,E,N,F,P,"I read an interview Phoebe gave about why she had Julien and Lucy feature on the song and she said something to the extent of ""because they inspired it."" I can't think of the exact interview but I'll link it here if I find it

Edit: it's [this](https://www.stereogum.com/2086915/phoebe-bridgers-interview-punisher-conor-oberst-1975-boygenius/franchises/interview/footnotes-interview/) interview where she says it: 

> **STEREOGUM:** You got back together with Lucy and Julien here. Why was this the one you wanted them to guest on?  
>  
>**BRIDGERS:** I wrote it around them. I was in Nashville writing it and listening to the recording, and Julien lives there. It felt right. There is something kind of magical about us coming together. I had gone on a trip just to visit, and then was writing that song, and then I came home and I was finishing the album and I was like, “Hey, do you guys wanna sing on this song? I finished it, do you want to sing on it remotely?” And then I was like, “Well, I can just buy a fucking ticket to Nashville.”  
>  
>So they agreed to come to the studio, everyone was in town again, and when I landed I had this text from Julien like, “Yo, I ran into Hayley Williams, do you want to [sing on her record too](https://www.stereogum.com/2083381/hayley-williams-paramore-petals-for-armor-boygenius-taylor-swift/franchises/interview/weve-got-a-file-on-you/)?” And I was like, “Yeah!” Every time we meet up some crazy shit like that happens. It felt awesome. When I’m very excited while recording I do this very theatre kid thing of jumping up and down. I did that to that extent where they were laughing at me when we were recording that song."

17359,I,S,F,P,"Okay so I just actively listened to a jazz album (like, *really* focused on it) and I think I can articulate why jazz frustrates me pretty well now.

It's kinda like, there's *something* about the music that's pretty interesting (like I like some of the instruments used in certain jazz genres, like electric guitar, vibraphone, electric piano, organ, etc) and there's this overall atmosphere that's pretty neat, but... jazz to me feels like the musical equivalent to really complex books like House of Leaves. Like, the overall concept and story is pretty interesting, and the first few pages hook you in a bit, but... at some point the whole thing seems to fall apart and the story starts getting ridiculously verbose with all sorts of words you don't even understand and everything goes everywhere at once and aaaaaahhhh chaos I can't even comprehend this anymore.

6w7s I have less experience with, but from what I can tell they're more on the positive and chill side due to their 7 wing. I think of Shaggy from Scooby Doo as the prime example of a 6w7, still very much has that 6 anxiety but is otherwise much more laid back and down to earth than 6w5s."

* Art is subjective. If this got disproven somehow (which I doubt is possible since objectivity in art is easily negated) I'd probably lose all my appetite for art and become very cynical and elitist in this regard, and it'd lead to excessive hierarchical thinking that way. Wouldn't call that an improvement. Maybe even an inferiority or superiority complex as an added bonus.

* Life has the meaning you give it. If that's disproven well, then we hit a dead end and technically I should just die when that happens since life is ruined at that point, which I really really really really hate. But this is similar to the above point.

Maybe a few things like these. But overall, even with politics and stuff idk, I'm open for discussion."

Kies vooral plofkip en kweekvis, bouw een vleesvrije dag of twee in en blijf vooral de alternatieven proberen. Als je dan een keertje uit eten bent dan neem je het er lekker van met een stuk tournedos of varkenshaas. Zo slijt die 'elke dag vlees' gewoonte vanzelf uit de generatie.

Ja als ik heel eerlijk moet zijn zou ik *behalve* snacks als frikandellen, en ook gehakt voor in taco's verder geheel vleesvrij kunnen leven. Meeste vlees doet me weinig. Dus ik denk dat ik eens een keer de vega frikandel probeer, en als die wat tegenvalt kan ik altijd nog overwegen om een tussengrond te kiezen waarbij ik wél een vlees frikandel eet maar verder geen ""gewoon"" vlees."

Yep. It only shows how insecure you are, and prevents you from reevaluating your opinions/stances/beliefs (Idk if there's a collective term for these things) by having them challenged or questioned, and possibly arriving at a better conclusion.

It's even better when they start verbally abusing you instead of providing proper arguments because you can use that against them by. But it all comes crashing down when you lose interest in the discussion all of a sudden (in my case at least)."

17666,I,N,T,P,"This exact scenario happened to me. My ENFP friend was dicussing his future plans with me this one time and when I criticized him and pointed out flaws in his thinking, he got really defensive and refused to even listen to what I had to say. I seriously considered cutting him off completely after that."
17667,I,N,T,P,Sounds fun.

17691,I,N,T,P,A-anything?
17692,I,N,T,P,Maybe?
17693,I,N,T,P,Im an INTP with ESFP and ISFJ parents and an ISFP sister. Go figure.
17694,I,N,T,P,Been watching too much re zero

17700,I,N,T,P,"When I watched that scene as a kid, all I could think of was how good those desserts looked."
17701,I,N,T,P,ORAORAORA
17702,E,N,T,P,That's some god level artwork here
17703,E,N,T,P,"Cant speak for ENTJ's, but im an ESTJ and i wear suits daily."
17704,E,N,T,P,/s
17705,E,N,T,P,"He's an ISFP, but it isn't obvious at first"
17706,E,N,T,P,"The INTJ guy lacks confidence, but he really is arrogant, the INTP on the other hand is very confident and extremely arrogant. I think my best friend INTJ has 50/50 chance of really having narcissistic personality disorder, but the second one, i am 90% sure he is a narcissist."
17707,E,N,T,P,"In my experience more thinkers are narcissists, from what i saw most of them were NT types (INTX mostly) My best friend INTJ is narcissistic, but in a slight way. My INTP friend is severely narcissistic, he is far more feeling than my INTJ friend, but his narcissism is sometimes unbearable, he has to always be the greatest, even if everyone tells him what he should change in himself in order for us to like him, he doesn't accept our criticism and he belittles us. It's been worsening with age."
17708,E,N,T,P,"I like to mix things up, obviously no person listens to only one genre, but i dont really care what the genre is if i like the songs. I listen to Jazz the most, i like Bebop Jazz because it always changes (ive heard that Jazz is the theme of ENTP's, i don't have ENTP friends so i cant really confirm). Besides jazz, i like some hard and deep music. From the top of my head, i cant tell i most often listen to Gorillaz, $uicideboys, Chet Baker and Yoko Kanno. Lofi, of course there are many lofi artists that i listen to often, but there are so many i cant name them all, like saib., Potsu and Nujabes."
17709,E,N,T,P,Amazing! This will make a great wallpaper
17710,E,N,T,P,Why would an NT want an NF? This is a serious question
17711,E,N,T,P,"It do be like that doe





I be white"
17712,E,N,T,P,"Of course, no sensors XDD

Whoever made that image, i think it exactly explains the good and the bad in the types, i learned a lot about my friends through this.
Waiting for the sensor version though."
17713,E,N,T,P,"I don't like how sensors are often thrown in the trash section, im a sensor, and most of my friends that are into MBTI, as soon as they learned im an ESTP, they started poking fun at me and saying stuff like ""You're a sensor, your shallow, you don't know anything, you don't understand philosophy etc."" It pisses me off that a letter in an online test can change your friends bias towards you."
17714,E,N,T,P,"Male ESTP, i dye my hair every few months"
17715,E,N,T,P,"Male ESTP, i dye my hair every few months"
17716,E,N,T,P,ENFP Aizen? What a load of bullshit.
17717,E,N,T,P,"My father is a stereotypical ENTJ, yet he always cries at movies."
17718,E,N,T,P,Its exactly like that
17719,E,N,T,P,Bee movie
17720,E,N,T,P,So the ESTP is at the gym and couldn't get there
17721,E,N,T,P,"Taking the test in English seems to give me more accurate results than taking it in my native language, happened to my friends too. Seems like the questions are constructed better in English"
17722,E,N,T,P,"Black veil brides
Gorillaz
Red hot chili peppers
Notorious B.I.G
saib."
17723,E,N,T,P,"What's this meme format name, i love it and saw many of those but i dont know how to search for them"
17724,E,N,T,P,"I am unable not to fidget during anything, coincidentally i just took a ADHD test and the results weren't clear, but from my experience and observation of my ESTP friends, i would say its normal for us to be restless and move all the time, heck i cant sit in a bus because i prefer to stand up because its more ""productive"". Never have i ever met a ESTP that sat still and was calm."
17725,E,N,T,P,"It made me start my calisthenics journey once again after i lost the motivation, now since i have some free time I'm training hard. Not only that, i am into boxing now too, so i gained one new ""hobby"" and got myself to resume my training."
17726,E,N,T,P,"I didn't train my abs for half a year, and then decided to get to 10% body fat via recomp. Not only did i became underweight, my abs are barely visible, decided it wasn't really worth it and i should focus on directly training the muscle more, you can have visible abs at 15% body fat and it looks great, but to get to that point you need to really train them hard."
17727,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, same. Ive been mistyped as an ENTJ for over half a year, the functions never really resonated with me and i always saw myself as more of a Se user than a Te user.  
ESTP 8w7"
17728,E,N,T,P,INTP i guess?
17729,E,N,T,P,Looks very INFP
17730,E,N,T,P,My first thought was INTP
17731,E,N,T,P,I would say ISFJ
17732,E,N,T,P,"My first thought was ISFP, could be ISTP though"
17733,E,N,T,P,That's what we thought
17734,E,N,T,P,Dio (JoJo)
17735,E,N,T,P,"Did the test myself and got completely different results

Yours look like an INFP to me
Could be ENFP"
17736,E,N,T,P,Either INTP or ENTP
17737,E,N,T,P,"ENTJ-Maple, kinda surprising"
17738,E,N,T,P,"Yeah, ive been researching mbti for over a year now and the tests are really predictable.  Thanks a lot!"
17739,E,N,T,J,Are you still in the womb?
17740,E,N,T,J,"In short, stay for the memes and nothing else."
17741,E,N,T,J,"If you want to leave I completely understand. I actually left the community for a while because I didn’t like how stereotypical some people were being. You will also find a ton of “No you can’t be a EXTJ and have emotions and/or a sense of humour.” That or “everyone is below me they just don’t understand how cool I am.” Honestly, I might leave again."
17742,E,N,T,J,Damn. Using your real face as your profile picture. I wish I was that cool.
17743,E,N,T,J,Dude are you 12?
17744,E,N,T,J,All ENTJs are the same
17745,E,N,T,J,I was pretty surprised with the small number of under 18 ENTJs. There are some fuckers in this sub who want to be like Genghis Khan and “spread their seed across the world” and “be as successful as him.”
17746,E,N,T,J,"I think emotions can certainly cloud your judgement, I definitely don’t consider them when I have to think about things logically, but I still think they are important to acknowledge. If you continue to ignore them they will eventually “explode” which will not only negatively impact you, but it can affect how you function."
17747,E,N,T,J,This question was destined to have really shitty comments. I am happy to be here.
17748,E,N,T,J,Don’t you mean ESFP?
17749,E,N,T,J,No you idiot. If the ENTJ is funny and/or likes having fun then it’s an ENTP.
17750,E,N,T,J,The ENTJ probably wouldn’t text while showering. Definitely the ENFJ. I also prefer “bitch” rather than “babe” thank you very much.
17751,E,N,T,J,ENTPs are definitely chimps. ENTJs as orcas is also very accurate.
17752,E,N,T,J,The ENTJs and INFJs are probably jacking of in the corner since they’re both in the 3 lowest percentages for all the groups.
17753,E,N,T,J,But an individual of every type can have a EQ that changes over time.
17754,E,N,T,J,Does anyone else worry that if they show emotions other people will use it against them? or perceive you as weak and therefore change the way they treat you?
17755,E,N,T,J,Good one
17756,E,N,T,J,"In all honesty though, this is a good point and something that I still have trouble coming to terms with. I think we think emotion is a weakness because it can disrupt our “efficiency.” Unfortunately I and many other ENTJs are eventually singled out whether it’s to lead or maximize efficiency in some situation. In that scenario of course you worry about handing emotion as you think it will hinder your ability to work."
17757,E,N,T,J,"Just change the way you’ve approached life for years, something that’s been taught to you your entire life, something that society demands of you if you want to be successful. It’s so easy guys common."
17758,E,N,T,J,I’ve found way more ENTJs and ENTPs that are rivals. With most ENTPs I know we will debate and talk shit (sometimes very loudly) while being friends or at least having a mutual respect.
17759,E,N,T,J,78.3% of people with two legs can walk
17760,E,N,T,J,I can feel the blood and tears of child laborers during the Industrial Revolution coursing through my veins.
17761,E,N,T,J,Where’s the restroom. Do you just shit outside?
17762,E,N,T,J,Unless you get to know the IXXX well in which case the person’s emotion are obvious as shit.
17763,E,N,T,J,"I have never met an ISFP, INFP, or ISFJ that’s good at hiding their emotions."
17764,E,N,T,J,If someone says or does something disrespectful to me without reason I just think about how I can become their supervisor or superior so I can eventually own them.
17765,E,N,T,J,"This is certainly an interesting question. It really depends on you definition of what is valuable. There are those who might argue that XXFXs are “idiots cringe, bleh” when they really offer a different perspective and they can be the glue that holds a group of people together. Basically, rephrase your question dickhead."
17766,E,N,T,J,"Honestly a lot of the INTPs I know are Humanities cringe type, STEM epic."
17767,E,N,T,J,Look. I would still fuck an INTP.
17768,E,N,T,J,So you lack empathy. That makes sense.
17769,E,N,T,J,What are your thoughts on Adolf Hitler?
17770,E,N,T,J,I like Adolf Hitler from Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shaballa.
17771,E,N,T,J,You seem to ignore the big picture.
17772,E,N,T,J,"OP, dud you recently learn about Genghiz Khan in a history class and think “Man I wish I could have 1000 kids by raping women and create the largest empire in world history through needless slaughter. I could do that if I reached my FULL POTENTIAL”?"
17773,E,N,T,J,Also “Islamic expansion” bad. The only good expansions are those related to Christianity.
17774,E,N,T,J,Why did you ask about my family’s stability? I am simply curious.
17775,E,N,T,J,"My immediate family is rather stable, with the exception of having moved states 10 times, but my siblings tend to get in trouble and my father would get into a lot of trouble as a child. That doesn’t necessarily mean they were inherently bad people."
17776,E,N,T,J,"I never went through the phase. I think it ultimately depends on the person. Someone might be perceived as a bad boy, but they’re actually I very nice person. If you are talking about dressing or appearing like a “bad boy” then no. I don’t particularly care about that sort of thing."
17777,E,N,T,J,"As an ENTJ I have often found myself interested in INXPs (and ENTPs, ISTPs, and INTJs). I love how introspective you guys are and, specifically in the case of INFPs, the fact that you guys are actually willing to look below the surface of my “spooky” exterior. I also love your guy’s dedication to your ideals, it’s something that I really respect. Your guy’s calm demeanor and greater emotional vulnerability is also very nice as it causes me to feel comfortable being vulnerable around you guys. I also love how you guys are very deep thinkers while being willing to look from a variety of perspectives. Many INFPs I know also give great hugs."
17778,E,N,T,J,I didn’t know that ENTJs partied. I know I personally prefer to hangout with a group of friends for fun rather than a lot of people. I also tend to use my Te and Ni way more when it comes to that sort of thing because it seems like a lot of parties have too high of a chance to result in something negative.
17779,E,N,T,J,Do you want to hmu?
17780,E,N,T,J,Please don’t.
17781,E,N,T,J,“Some collateral damage”
17782,E,N,T,J,"Imagine being something other than a straight white male, which can create a variety of boundaries that can make becoming a millionaire by “pulling the right strings” far more difficult."
17783,E,N,T,J,"I think it really depends on the audience. In certain environments an ENTPs bluntness could be considered disrespectful. This is especially the case for ENTPs who are unable to change their demeanor depending on the circumstance. Apparently this is the case for other ENTJs, but I tend to fake it until I make it and I can quickly change my persona, even my voice, depending on the environment."
17784,E,N,T,J,I think it’s important to consider that we are on reddit. Therefore a small number of us have actually had sex. Basically. this is bs and I refuse to believe that INTPs have sex. Thank you.
17785,E,N,T,J,Where’s WeChat?
17786,E,N,T,J,What are you talking about? It is very accurate. You stinky feeler.
17787,E,N,T,J,When you reduce billions of people to 16 personality types there are bound to be stereotypes. MBTI is more of a framework and based on cognitive functions. While some stereotypes can be true they aren’t all necessarily applicable to everyone of a particular type.
17788,E,N,T,J,According to this subreddit yes. That is bs though.
17789,I,N,F,P,Super pretty! The nose bone or whateverthehellit'scalled might be a tad wide but other than that 👏👏
17790,I,N,F,P,That would make sense. How did you get rid of the issue?
17791,I,N,F,P,"I am in therapy, and have been for a year now. I also have medication."
17792,I,N,F,P,"Yea you can't really see that they're swimming in water, but idk I think it makes the painting alot more interesting"
17793,I,N,F,P,Love the concept! Maybe add some deeper black to make it pop a bit more
17794,I,N,F,P,"Sounds good, I'll add you when I can :)"
17795,I,N,F,P,Ahhhhh I'm so proud of you🧡
17796,I,N,F,P,"Or ""they are just trying to be nice"""
17797,I,N,F,P,I caught myself sneaking around in my house more times than I'd like to admit after playing the last of us 2
17798,I,N,F,P,"Thank you for this incredibly sweet message, it actually made me feel quite alot better 🧡"
17799,I,N,F,P,Lol I do that waaay to much and I always feel as bad.
17800,I,N,F,P,I'm down to talk too if you feel like it :)
17801,I,N,F,P,Nope ;)
17802,I,N,F,P,Finland
17803,I,N,F,P,"Thanks :) I find it very magical too, it's just something about being the only one awake, not having any responsibilities and the quiet that makes me feel so peaceful."
17804,I,N,F,P,"I have always loved being up at night, it's the time I feel most at peace. Is this an INFP thing or is it just a crippling depression thing?"
17805,I,N,F,P,"I just love talking with thinkers. I tend to get waaay too emotionally involved in things and I often let emotions rule me, even if I try not to let them. Thinkers often fascinate me with their completely different way of thinking and they often clear up my emotional cocktails. Mad props to the thinkers."
17806,I,N,F,P,"Yuuuuup. Did this alot during quarentine. There's nothing more satisfying than turning something in the minute before the due time, and still be confident in the work"
17807,I,N,F,P,This is scarily accurate. I'm infp and this described me very accurately and the entj one sounds exactly like a friend of mine
17808,I,N,F,P,"Wow I have nothing bad to say about this,  well done!
I love how detailed the fur is"
17809,I,N,F,P,Oh my god all of your tattoes are so beautiful.
17810,I,N,F,P,"Hoooly shit I have never related this hard to a post on here before, and it feels comforting that this many people experience it too. I don't feel like a person anymore, more like extreme emotions battling for control over me, and dissociation doesn't make it any better. I truly feel alone at times but coming on here makes me feel so much stronger. Having mental illness is a shit hand to be delt, but we'll all fight this thing together 🧡"
17811,I,N,F,P,I really like it! What I would change if it was my drawing is I would add some shading under the chin and maybe some darker black spots for contrast
17812,I,N,F,P,Awww I appreciate you op
17813,I,N,F,P,Oh god I saw that as steven universe at first and now I can't unpicture him with humongous knockers. Great design tho...
17814,I,N,F,P,"I literally started weeping from that video, that's one of my worst fears. I really hope you get all this sorted out op"
17815,I,N,F,P,Jesus fucking christ that TLDR will forever haunt me
17816,I,N,F,P,Was that at the beginning or had you been taking it a while before you got angry?
17817,I,N,F,P,Oh god yes we do. Please help us
17818,I,N,F,P,"Sure, but only if I get to pick the music"
17819,I,N,F,P,So everyone doesn't do that...? It hasn't gone a day in 3 years where I haven't thought about suicide atleast once
17820,I,N,F,P,Do you have room for one more?
17821,I,N,F,P,"I'm glad you can relate (well not really, this shit ain't fun). You can always hit me up if you need to vent a bit 🧡"
17822,I,N,F,P,You shouldn't take memes literally...
17823,I,N,F,P,"Left is a reference to a time where I was extremely depressed and was convinced I was trans, hence the haircut."
17824,I,N,F,P,"This has happened to me so much lol, high-school sure is fun."
17825,I,N,F,P,"Same here, it's soo good"
17826,I,N,F,P,Wow this is exactly how I feel atm. I get 10 times better at drawing when I'm happy but when i get depressed all the progress is gone and I can't rven draw a simple sketch anymore. It absolutely sucks
17827,I,N,F,P,"Yeah I get that, it can be really refreshing. I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't for the occasional anger bursts"
17828,I,N,F,P,"Have you talked to your doctor/therapist about this? I'm going to tomorrow, because this is not how I want to live, and if it's how you feel to I hope you get help too"
17829,I,N,F,P,"Oh man that sounds fun, if only it wasn't 2 am here rn. Thanks for the tip though, might try it tomorrow"
17830,I,N,F,P,"Can really relate to the not caring part. I have a hard time caring about stuff I was very enthusiastic about before, and things like my safety doesn't reallt concern me anymore. I also have moodswings and have had days where I felt absolutely fantastic, only to wake up depressed the next. These 2 months of taking zoloft has truly been the weirdest in my life."
17831,I,N,F,P,"Thanks! Really needed this tbh, I blacked out last time I drank and I'm going to drink tomorrow again, but I will for sure take it easier this time."
17832,I,N,F,P,"Woah, looks great! Love the artstyle, really unique and charming!"
17833,I,N,F,P,Here's a non random junk email notification for you :)
17834,I,N,F,P,I think they were trying to say despacito
17835,I,N,F,P,I think it was despacito lol
17836,I,N,F,P,"Thank you :) I definitely feel a bit better now, atleast more grounded, thank you for asking!"
17837,I,N,F,P,"I used to care about my friends. Alot. But now I'm just there for them and doing stuff for them because I know that's what the ""real"" me would have done. Feeling guilty about it doesn't help, I think it's important that we remind ourselves that it's just our brains being dicks and not because we are bad people."
17838,I,N,F,P,"I used to care about stuff you know. I used to be funny, and people liked me, even me. I used to be the one stearing the car but now I'm just the passenger of my own stupid brain. 

We will both get through this though. Shit doesn't always stay shit."
17839,E,N,F,P,"*Geisteswissenschaftler, das was du nennst sind Hexen"

17842,E,N,F,P,"The Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd

Well, obviously"
17843,E,N,F,P,A shadow is just the absence of light
17844,E,N,F,P,He started taking cocaine and tripping on acid. Wanted me to take some. I replied with no. He didn't let go. I stood up and left in the middle of the night. He was very chill to be around with but this is a no go for me.
17845,E,N,F,P,Hahaha thats one high level joke right there
17846,E,N,F,P,Laughed way too hard at this
17847,E,N,F,P,Y'all ever done this on Wii Sports Resort?
17848,E,N,F,P,Back in my graduation year in my religion class we talked about ancient greeks. A girl asked how they could live 3000 years ago when the earth is just 2018 years old.

17870,E,N,F,P,"You can activate instances and deactivate them by regions. So in the step event you do smthing like

Instance_deactivate(your obj)

Note that this is just a mockup so dont copy it and code it yourself.

If there are loading bugs create a render var, set it to something like 16 and subtract it from x/yview and add it to w/hview

People tend to view vaporwave only as a meme, but it's become more than a meme now. Lots of albums has interesting themes and vibes like a dystopian sci fi cyberpunk city, a virtual holographic shopping mall, a virtually generated synthetic forest, or a empty dead mall in the 1980s.

Now it gets a bit difficult to explain as I don't understand it as much either, but basically as it has more surface area, it can hold on to more water molecules per particle, making it more able to float, being perfectly dispersed in water, as opposed to coffe particles that are just big and will sink.

18020,I,N,T,P,"The socialist economic calculation problem makes determining the market value of goods produced in a socialist economy nearly impossible. 

In layman's terms, nobody, not even Stalin, can accurately determine how much people would pay for the goods produced in a socialist economy, because they're not sold, but instead distributed. Because purchase decisions have a lot of thought put into it, or at the very least low-supply thought (e.g. if you're a rocket manufacturer and you're trying to decide whether to use alloy X or alloy Y for the engine bell, you need highly trained engineers to make this decision) it follows that the producer cannot figure out how much demand there is for different products without a price mechanism (They might ask customers but then there exists an incentive to exaggerate your own complaints so you receive  more R&D resources. Also, in socialist countries, both the producer and consumer entities would have their decisions made by bureaucrats, so you would just ask some other bureaucrats as opposed to engineers.). See ^1

In the USSR and other socialist countries they usually piggybacked off prices for similar products produced in other countries, but that is at best an approximation. To compute GDP (total market value of goods produced in a year) statistics, the state-run statistics agency must use placeholder prices for domestic goods.

 The state has an incentive to use artificially inflated prices for propaganda purposes. 

This is apparent even in other countries, like the US. The US had a pretty heavily state-controlled economy around the period 1929-1945, first under Hoover's "" proposals to private business and to Congress of the largest proportion"" (the ''''''proposals'''''' to private business weren't exactly optional and there was an implied threat of executive orders), then under FDR's new deal, then under WW2 wartime controls. If you believe official statistics, WW2 saw massive GDP growth, and the year 1946 saw a GDP decline on the scale of the Great Depression. However, the people who actually lived through the end of WW2 usually talk of a post war boom. This can be explained by inflated prices for military equipment during the wartime state control of the economy leading to flawed GDP statistics.

^1 I want you to imagine the economy as a resource management video game with very very very very many kinds of resources. You would need lots of training and knowledge and skill in order to figure the most efficient way that you can turn some resources into any given kind of resource (say alloys and high skill labour and testing time and testing equipment and whatnot into a single resource titled 'satelite launches'. Oh and there aren't a finite number of kinds of resources, there are actually parameters that make that number infinite, e.g 99% safety satellite launches vs 97% safety satellite launches, this is just a simplification that still leaves the system hopelessly complex. And you have to compute the value of each of the input resources yourself, it's not precomputed, and they all have different input resources of their own, e.g. high skill labour might have beds, food, education, coffee and countless more.). Attempting to optimize this system is a task requiring a gargantuan amount of human braintime. The great thing about capitalism is that it divides this gargantuan task between individuals more or less automatically (search for ""emergent order"" in your favorite search engine), in the following way: people compete to turn a given set of resources into a new set of resources. 

Crucially, they get price signals about how much the input resources cost. This tells them which input resources to prioritize in their attempt to optimize their production of output resources by reducing their consumption of input resources. This whole process then creates a new price signal that gets handed down to the consumers of the output resource, which probably produce their own output  resources and so on. In the end, the whole system produces a resource called utility (in layman's terms, happiness points), which is what motivates people to optimize their production, because they'll produce more output resources and obtain more resources when exchanging them, the purpose of these resources is to obtain directly or via exchange some other resources and so on down the line until you get to resources like ""hour of Reddit time"" which get converted directly into the ultimate resource we're all after, utility.


Things you might want to type into your favorite search engine: ""austrian economics"", ""Hayek's theory of prices"", ""emergent order"".

I like the way I originally intended this comment to be a short and to the point reply to the post but it has become significantly more than that. It is an essay full of capitalist propaganda.

18053,I,N,T,P,"There has never been any such thing as a socialist revolution. Whenever socialism has entered a country through violence, it was always because of another country trying to force socialism on it (Germany -> Russia 1917; Russia -> China 1949; Russia and/or China -> all others). The truth is most people are just naturally disgusted by the idea of a socialist revolution, as they should be.

There have however been many instances of socialism entering a country through elections."

18161,I,N,F,P,Jokes on you I do both
18162,I,N,F,P,"Well some can, but definitely not all, at least from personal experience. Thing is is that any type can be stubborn, but some might have a tendency to be more stubborn on certain topics"
18163,I,N,F,P,"Yeah... But I feel like the INTP in this situation would just say ""well, let's find out!"" and then go to sleep"
18164,I,N,F,P,Your* annoying
18165,I,N,F,P,"Well then perhaps ENTJs and INFPs are more similar than I thought, given that from what I've seen it's also common for INFPs to fall in love really hard and already imagining a future with that significant person. I think that if you're aware of who you are you can have a better understanding of your emotions and therefore you can control them better. Or maybe you let that intensity out too much and that scares people away, but I'm not sure."
18166,I,N,F,P,"That's why is a bit of luck because not everyone is going to stay with you just because you opened up. But that still doesn't mean that everyone is going to leave you. It's a high risk high reward situation and you always have to keep a open mind to possible bad experiences but I still think it's better to be a bit more honest to more people and be open to the more important ones, even if the good results aren't guaranteed.
I hope you recover from your heartbreak."
18167,I,N,F,P,"Honestly, finding people that you can connect is also a bit of luck. But by your text it seems that you've never interacted with anyone without the mask and since that makes the relationship lack in genuineness I can see why they fall apart. You may not have found someone that you feel that can show more of yourself, trust me I know how that feels, but you also have to risk vulnerability to achieve that. I think all of you can make genuine connections but you have to learn how to make them which can be a process you're not used to."
18168,I,N,F,P,"Don't let this make you feel bad! 
ENTJs can also be scary, annoying, weird and evil!

This is a joke, love you guys"

18170,I,N,F,P,Idk about the anime part but I could write a chapter about it if you want me to
18171,I,N,F,P,I swear that the more you draw the more I think about creating an anime based on MBTI and ENTP is the main character
18172,I,N,F,P,I mean... My ENTP brother switches from showing memes about heavy topics like cancer to showing wholesome memes about a cute panda and since he mostly shows about heavy topics I don't know how to react when it's wholesome '-'
18173,I,N,F,P,"Chances are he likes you because he gladly takes that time of the day to be with you, at least from perspective. Wish you the best of luck! ENTJ	/INFP is my favorite combo and I'd be happy to know you two in a relationship. 
p.s. Obrigado!"
18174,I,N,F,P,Do you text each other? If so he will probably text you back right away (not ALWAYS obviously) because he will see it as a special moment of his day
18175,I,N,F,P,"It depends on what kind of relationship you want.
Being shy might make it harder to meet more potential partners but in a deep and genuine relationship being shy and unattractive aren't that important.
So keep on dreaming my friend it isn't impossible :)"
18176,I,N,F,P,"Thank you for your very thoughtful response! 
Since I've never dated anyone and don't pay attention to my  friends who do, I'm just a bit insecure about scaring a possible girlfriend away because I didn't do what I'm supposed to, but looking at your response I'm just going to go at my pace, that is when I start seeing someone.
Good luck with your guy! With your helpful advice and experience I can tell that you are quite the catch haha."
18177,I,N,F,P,"I know this isn't a response you want but, as a teen who has never dated and doesn't interact much with lots people I wanted to know if is it normal to have sex on the third date or that's just what happened to you two?"

18182,I,N,F,P,"ENTJs are the ones that are able to turn the light inside their head in reality making a lot of broken dreamers happy just to know them, and even though I've never been in a relationship I sure hope I start with a ENTJ because I love you all, including you!"
18183,I,N,F,P,Yes chance dear entj
18184,I,N,F,P,That's what infp's are here for :P
18185,I,N,F,P,Is it me or is the INFP at their best the worst of these types at their best?
18186,I,N,F,P,"I can't relate to these memes because is always hard for me imagining someone not knowing what they're feeling.

Sorry for the flex"
18187,I,N,F,P,Ok so I assume that's a no on giving up on petty insults instead of actually trying to be better.
18188,I,N,F,P,"Well, miss tradicional, maybe the guys you tried to date also want a tradicional relationship in which you don't fit since you're a female ENTJ. You make a lot of assumptions about what other women want to date despite dating preference being a subjective thing which leads me to belive that you aren't a bright person. Btw if you want to prove why you are right try arguing instead of name calling (but I'm willing to guess you'll just say ""I don't care what other people think"" because you don't want to face the fact that your logic is just shitty). Also it's not ENTJ males fault for not wanting to date your narcissistic immature ass, they're just dodging a bullet. Log off the internet and come back when you have a less dumb bommer mindset"
18189,I,N,F,P,"Then I think it's better if you have a wider circle of friends or people you trust, because it's important to not rely on one single person to help you through hard emotional times, only exception is if the person in question is your psychiatrist or something. I'm not saying to rely on 50 people but I don't think that just one person is enough, so try to make more genuine connections and/or healthy friendships or even hiring a psychiatrist if you feel that's necessary"
18190,I,N,F,P,"Hey there, INFP lurker here! I'm going to respond because I have felt everything you listed and I wanted to help, or at least tell my experience with that. 
As stated by the people that gave you advice I too think that closing your feelings and trying to work it all out by yourself is a bad idea, at least from personal experience, and the opposite of you should do, not to say that you should burst into tears to a stranger but try to talk about it to friends or close people whom you respect (I'd recommend feelers) 
Another thing is to try note down, on a daily basis, what your thankful about in your life and what you have accomplished in the day you're writing. 
 Your problem comes from your own perspective about yourself so that's what needs to change and when you get your self confidence you'll see that you'll become the best version of yourself. 
 On a final note, everyone is deserving of love but to truly achieve it you first need to love yourself and the people you are close. 
Pick yourself up, you deserve it and you can"
18191,I,N,F,P,"I don't know if this is relevant but me and my friend are both teenagers, so do you think that this type of fantasy of the steryotipical attractive guy will disappear the older girls get? Not asking about my friend specifically, because I don't have romantic interest in her, I was thinking in a more broad way"
18192,I,N,F,P,Thank you for the advice! I will do the first option since she is writing more for herself then to be published and I'm more of a intruder if I start criticizing it. Honestly I think that this insecurity will continue until I develop mutual feelings with a girl. Btw I saw your post about male INFPs and just wanted to say that I really liked it
18193,I,N,F,P,"The thing is: I also show her the things I write and so I think it would only be fair that I see hers and she might feel ""betrayed"" if I just said I didn't want to read anymore and on top of that I want to give her the courage to show it to more people (she sends me chapters from time to time btw) . Also I have no romantic interest in her although I'd be lying if I didn't admit I had but as for now our relationship is only friendly."
18194,I,N,F,P,We lurkers shall rise! As well as male INFPs! By the way thank you for the encouragement and tell your partner I said hi
18195,I,N,F,P,"Very interesting stuff indeed. My experience to being a male feeler is that I used to repress my emotions really hard, because when I was a kid I used to cry a lot and of course I was repreended for that, and so when I inicial took the test I tried multiple times again to see if I was a thinker but I slowly became more into terms that I am a INFP and that helped me become a more healthy person since I allowed to be myself"
18196,I,N,F,P,Now that I thought about it there was a girl that I kinda liked but then I discovered that she takes astrology kinda seriously and that was a big turn off I just didn't want to admit because she is really nice and one of my best friends
18197,I,N,F,P,"I assume you don't know about the Golden pairs theory which is basically ""two types really match if all the letters in the type are switched except for the N or S"" so according to that theory your parents seem to be a perfect match, but what most people don't seem to take to account is that it is absolutely necessary that the two people involved must be mature for it to work out.
I personally look at that theory in this way ""these two types, when mature, can have a really fulfilling relationship since they are opposites and can learn from each other as well as finding comon ground"""
18198,I,N,F,P,"Interestingly enough I've heard (not from personal experience but someone in a similar position) the same shpeel about girls wanting to fix a guy, therefore the conclusion I get is that the majority of guys want a dumb and submissive gf and the majority of girls want a obnoxious asshole bf, but this type of preference seems shallow and what you see in stupid romances written by teen girls who never had a boyfriend or stupid dating sims made by teen boys who never had a girlfriend and hopefully the people that act this way will grow out of it"
18199,I,N,F,P,"I was already kinda expecting that if you were shamed then it was probably done by other women, but Jesus Christ I didn't know about the toxicity some can spew. But that's another that really irritates me is the shaming some people to make others have the same conventional taste, like I don't want act like a victim or something but I just know that if I date a ENTJ girl I will get mocked for that and will she for dating a INFP dude"
18200,I,N,F,P,"And have you ever been mocked for going for the quieter men? Since most ENTJ women have expressed that they find it more difficult to befriend other women, maybe some of those laughed at your situation. Oh and congrats on finding a satisfying relationship and discovering what you want in one"
18201,I,N,F,P,"Wow, talking to ENTJ women is really interesting and refreshing. I hope that maybe after knowing that other women (and guys) feel the same way sometimes makes you feel a bit better"
18202,I,N,F,P,"Aawww. Your comment is really sweet and comforting, because it let's me know that there are girls who prefer sweet and soft guys. I also would like to let you and everyone reading this know that guys who like you because of your less ""feminin"" characteristics. Your comment also looks like you were trying to make me less insecure about my charactistics which I have to thank you for
Edit: I also saved your comment because is informative, sweet and helps overcome this type of thought"
18203,I,N,F,P,I had no idea that there's guys who like women that are less intelegent than them. I just assumed that at least the grand majority of dudes preferd smart girls because that's what I take into consideration and never saw that pattern of preference
18204,I,N,F,P,"Thank you, for real. Thank you for trying to comfort a random stranger I really appreciate it. The more I think about and interact with female ENTJs the more I think I need one in my life :)"
18205,I,N,F,P,"I think thinkers tend to prefer feelers and vice versa and since the thinking types are usually more associated with males and feelers with females it can generate this feeling I asked about in this post. Although I do have to say that balancing the cognitive functions is really important to make someone seen as more of a great potential partner, for example a ENTJ with developed Fi or a INFP with a developed Te, but it can sometimes feel frustrating to not be what girls tend to prefer"
18206,I,N,F,P,"ENTJ really don't take shit from anyone, hu? That actually saves a lot of time and energy by thinking that way"
18207,I,N,F,P,"That's a really good phrase to keep in mind, but my intentions with this post was to know if female ENTJs felt this way not if they were sure it was because if that, and of course that unhealthyness in anyone doesn't help getting in a relationship"
18208,I,N,F,P,Congrats on overcoming a insecurity and finding a fitting partner!
18209,E,N,F,P,Thank you! I don't know why it's not showing for you but here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7nVntZpJLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7nVntZpJLM)

18218,E,N,F,P,"I'm sorry to be ""that guy"", but doesn't it hurt the turtle?"
18219,E,N,F,P,"Learn to wink like a pro. Hold one of your eyes open and repeatedly close the other one or hold one close and blink with the other. I did it everyday for a couple of weeks everytime I brushed my teeth. Muscle memory, man."

18223,E,N,F,P,"These memes are even worse because they ""pretend"" they're not sexist (girls doing normal things is hardly an insult), and therefore it is harder to criticize them. I feel like boys don't see how problematic these memes are"
18224,E,N,F,P,"I think so, yes. I think INFPs will always be on average more radical than ENFPs because of their dominant Fi, which makes them hold their values very close to their heart. Ne on the other hand is a little bit more willing to bend our moral values for the sake of exploration so I think ENFPs would be more moderate."
18225,E,N,F,P,"I don't know why, but I was convinced I was on r/selfimprovement so this had double the kick for me. Great job! Storytelling through neat dialogue is the best kind of storytelling!

18241,E,N,F,P,"A lot of things happen in the unconscious. The fact that you shy away may be because of something small the person did, something you didn't before realized bothered you. It may also be a question of experience, you may have been hurt by a person who was similar in one way or another. The next time you feel strongly about someone try to follow that feeling!:)"
18242,E,N,F,P,"I noticed that it's usually a question of knowing one's self. Of course it's a skill which comes with more ease to ones than the others but it *can* be practised!:) Your strong Ti will probably make analizing your environment very easy. To get to know yourself you need to focus that energy inward. Observe your thoughts, behaviours and feelings, look at patterns. That way you can be more sure of what you want and have a closer connection with your partner:)"
18243,E,N,F,P,"ENFP F, I try to give an equal space for emotions and rational thinking when it comes to decisions like this, I'm guessing you are skilled at the latter base on the fact that you also posted this question on r/ENTP:) I usually take into account how comfortable I am with the other person, do I consciously have to make effort when talking or do we naturally understand each other, whether I trust them when they tell me something, and if I dont then is it because of me or do I have reasons not to. These are some of the questions I ask myself, but I usually just trust my heart, cause, at least in my case, if I start thinking about it too much I am never confident in the decision I make.

18264,I,N,T,J,When I saw this I laughed at my notification like a mad man! This is gold
18265,I,N,T,J,"Eh, not really"

18268,I,N,T,J,"Meh, I share my thoughts into the abyss. At least that one cares about me lmao. But I post decently often on my Instagram. I'm an artist so of course I'd like my art to be seen. I don't make fake accounts, and all my accounts have my username or a connection to it. I only have a discord account for back up. I don't mind what the world sees on my accounts, I don't care at all actually. Ironically enough, I'm more bold online than irl. Lol, but that's kinda it."
18269,I,N,T,J,"Them. Simple as that, they have passive aggressive humour. They belittle you and have a superiority complex. I rarely laugh with them. Their only jokes are the ones who are made about your physical appearance or what you like. I rest my case."
18270,I,N,T,J,"Same, since I was a kid. Especially when my family argues and ends up being physical, I think in my head, that I have choices and should do something. But I don't feel like the situation is real, I don't feel anything, I don't really know what to do. So I just let my instincts do whatever, and I end being physical too. Idk, I just became more violent these recent years. I never really told my mother, I just told her ""What if this is a dream inside a dream"" and stuff like that. I don't really feel safe at all when I express my feelings around her so I just don't. It has always been like this and it's driving me nuts. And it doesn't help when my feelings are invalidated and ignored. In conclusion, yeah, I relate to this when I'm under a large wave of stress and adrenaline but I don't know what it is. It happens quite often actually, I just brush it off."
18271,I,N,T,J,"Yep, thanks for confirming, I'm both INTJ and INFJ at my worst at the moment. :""D"
18272,I,N,T,J,"Lmao, trueee"
18273,I,N,T,J,"That's the majority, but I can find girls like me. I usually interact with who I like and they just stick to me. I don't really have friends in real life because I'm anti social and I can't really express myself properly. Anyway, but I have friends online who share almost the same views as me. While it's true, it's not a strong bond but it's a good bond. You said smart women avoid talking about deep, intellectual topics, but are they really that smart? That's the question you have to ask. Or be straightforward and just ask them ""Why don't you ever talk about other topics, like, idk art or politics?"". If they're that smart, they shouldn't be afraid to answer, but if they get defensive or offended, then you know, they're not that smart as you think. That's my opinion tho, I can't really tell you a lot, I'm a teenager but I observed my female peers and my mom's sisters and friends. I can tell you tho, that smart girls aren't afraid to talk about other topics, my classmate was really trying to bond with me. We're just friends now. But she is smart, both in school and outside of it. So, yeah, that's kinda my opinion, I can bond with both genders, but I tend to incline towards boys."

18285,I,N,T,J,I feel called out. Smfh.
18286,I,N,T,J,"I don't know, man. I usually fake my mood when I want attention or want to make someone be in a good mood that I like (i.e. friends or my mother). Yeah, it feels like temporary happiness and then I feel super drained. That's my way of dealing with it or, I express myself physically, either alone or with someone (mostly alone). I'm quite aggressive because that's how I feel but I repress that feeling and it ends up being worse(I'm working on that on my own, big yikes, I know).

I guess, you could do little things to show how you feel.

Wrting, music, art, poetry, maybe even programming or sculpting, riddles or paper craft. You choose it. Don't fake how you feel like me  'cause it will make you tired. Usually people are very receptive so if you do small smiles or some type of face, they will know how you feel. Just don't overwork yourself. And do it when it's necessary. I am not so sure about this tho, so take everything you read with a grain of salt.

Good luck!"

18322,I,N,F,P,"A lot of people think depression is just being sad. In reality it’s so much more than that and this poem captured that. It seeps into every aspect of life, into every /type/ of sadness and makes itself known. Good job capturing that."
18323,I,N,F,P,"First of all, that ion line was fire. 

But in all seriousness I interpreted this as a cry out for a partner. Maybe romantic. Maybe not. But a partner none the less. A relationship that goes past the superficial, a relationship strong enough to become a part of you. The yin to your yang or like you said in the poem the thunder to your lightning. All in all I liked the piece, keep it up."
18324,I,N,F,P,Thank you for listening 😔

18326,I,N,F,P,"Funny enough, I already told her and it was a no. Right now I’m in the process of healing from that and she’s the one I always talk to about emotional pain. But I can’t in this case cause she is the cause of it"

18328,I,N,F,P,"Mate we’re in the middle of a god damn pandemic, the world is on fire, shits gone shot to hell and you’re  beating yourself up because you can’t be a ray of sunshine right now. I tell you this with my heart as I was in that exact same hole you’re in right now. 

My friend, you can’t boil the ocean. In other words we can’t control everything. We just have to pick our battles and go from there. And it’s okay to feel down or sad or mopey some days. You’d give your friends reprieve if they were going through something so why not give that to yourself. What matters is that you don’t stop getting up and chasing the goals that you set for yourself. Do not give up my friend."
18329,I,N,F,P,"Who ever said that this typing is a condemnation? I definitely understand where you’re coming from as our negatives are drastically blasted out of proportion by the self depreciation memes and shit from other mbti subs. The mbti test really exposes your cognitive functions and the way you are most likely to think and make decisions. Emphasis on most likely. You can do whatever the fuck you wanna do. If you wanna sit around and mope you can do that. If you wanna get up and change the world you can do that too. It won’t be because your an infp, it’ll be because you set your mind to accomplish it. All the typing says it that there may be a certain way you go about accomplishing it. I beseech you, come out of that dark hole. Don’t pin these issues on being an infp, recognize what they are , where they come from, and what you’re going to do about it."

18357,I,N,F,P,Ya boi checking in ✌🏾
18358,I,N,F,P,Thank you 🙏🏾. I’ve looked at these feelings for years and they’ve ebbed and flowed but never subsided. It’s just frustrating as my brain and heart are going in to different directions and pulling back or throttling forward could result in things getting weird between us.
18359,I,N,T,J,"I’m not going to say you shouldn’t do it because at the end of the day I can’t save you. Only you can. You’re 16. You have years ahead of you to find yourself and become who you want to be. You also have years to find the person who is meant for you. In case soulmates exist, maybe wait a little longer for that person. You don’t want them to be alone, right? How about the recipes and stories you’ll one day share and tell? You must tell them! You need to, so maybe wait a little longer to one day tell them. And don’t forget the people you have and will one day impact. You can’t leave them on the edge of their seats waiting for the time that you saved them from making a mistake. Just like I’m here to tell you not to do it. I may not know you, but I do love you. And I know that maybe even if the people around you don’t, you’ll one day soon get the people who love you around you. Travel the world first before you end it. Make sure to complete everything your heart desires before you call it quits. In the end, you only have one life. Even if you do decide to end it, I will pray that you get everything you wanted down here up there. I love you, stranger, and I wish you’d love you too. (But it’s okay because you don’t have to always love yourself.)"
18360,I,N,T,J,"This makes too much sense. Part of me wants to disagree, but the part of me from two years ago says that you’re completely and utterly correct."
18361,I,N,T,J,I wish I could be unhappy in peace without someone asking if I was on my period.
18362,I,N,T,J,Happy birthday!!! I hope you have a fabulous and beautiful day. I recommend getting donuts or cupcakes as a treat :)
18363,I,N,T,J,Thank you!!
18364,I,N,T,J,Also how does the blue “INTJ” thing pop up?
18365,I,N,T,J,Oh okay!!! How you’re describes me quite a bit as well. Thank you!!
18366,I,N,T,J,"I get that, but I have had times where I strongly thought someone liked me when they didn’t. I think it was because one of the guys was already very extroverted and flirtatious. I also wish to be direct with that, but it’s annoying when people won’t allow you to be direct."
18367,I,N,T,J,They really said “This you?”
18368,I,N,T,J,"Is it bad that I’m an INTJ, but I don’t respond like that? I have an immense feeling of guilt if I am rude to others even though I also have a strong feeling to reply that way."
18369,I,N,T,J,"My cousin said I try too hard to be nice, but it’s true because in my head is the second one even though I say the first one."
18370,I,N,T,J,That’s quite interesting!! I read up on how we tend to prefer directness which is pretty spot on. I think we tend to pick up on a lot of social cues better than most even if we aren’t perceived as “social” people.
18371,I,N,T,J,"Oh wow!! I thought he knew you liked him, and he never communicated with you. I would say be straight with him on your intentions and feelings completely. Also try to do an exercise where you both say how you’re feeling that day. Try to open up more on how you’re feeling, so that he feels comfortable expressing his. I assume you are a loyal individual who won’t do anything to harm another person, so please make sure to make that clear with him. It’s okay to say this every now and then as a reminder that you will always be there. INTJ’s HATE liars!! Please also stop with any small talk which can cause us INTJ’s to lose interest, so please just dive into whatever. I think you would better be able to communicate over video chat or in person (if allowed)."
18372,I,N,T,J,"If he doesn’t talk to you, he probably doesn’t like you. We are pretty forward, and we aren’t into “hints”. Maybe be a bit more forward with him, and see where his head is at as well."
18373,I,N,T,J,"Please don’t avoid eating in order to lose weight! It can turn into a really bad e##ing disorder! Try to seek advice to a medical professional, so that you can get what your body needs!! I wish you all the luck and love."
18374,I,N,T,J,"Interesting. I like red velvet cake, but the thought of it makes me have a weird taste in my mouth."
18375,I,N,T,J,True! It’s so weird to dislike an animal unless you have some trauma.

18383,I,N,F,J,"ESH. I know a mute will affect your ability to listen for intonation but if you’re playing at that level you’re going to be playing long enough that it’s going to burn people out. Use your mute, negotiate a set time with your roommate, and play in your room. It’s rough listening to myself after an hour or two of practice. I can’t imagine being someone who doesn’t like violin or is involuntarily subjected to it lol."
18384,I,N,F,J,NTA. At.All. Don’t let her guilt trip you. I feel for her but if there wasn’t a “bio mom” in the picture at all she would do what anyone else would do and seek out resources. An open adoption doesn’t mean a default back up plan
18385,I,N,F,J,YTA. You ruined the moment for yourself and likely for him too
18386,I,N,F,J,"My malar rash looks like someone slapped me. It’s very pronounced, and people often comment on it when I’m flaring. It’s usually raised and scaly or bumpy - like hives. In my opinion it doesn’t look like a malar rash"
18387,I,N,F,J,Mine is in one of my arms and several of my fingers. I also interpret pain and heat wrong
18388,I,N,F,J,Love some Shakshukka
18389,I,N,F,J,My last one was also 1:1280 with normal sed rates. AntiDsDna negative as well. I do have nerve damage. 🤷🏼‍♀️lupus does weird things
18390,I,N,F,J,"NTA. I have the feeling a lot of people in these comments don’t have kids. 
The situation is unfortunate? Yes. But Safety over security. There was another available bathroom, you washed the sheets, she stayed with grandma etc. it’s not ideal but imagine what you’d live with if your toddler had drowned.

To the people talking about “turn your water off at night” WTF are you talking about? I know literally no one that can shut off water directly to their tub. The entire water main to my home is BARELY accessible in a crawl space. Restricting her kid from one bathroom (with another one accessible) for a couple of days is not a Geneva convention violation like some folks are making it out to be. SMH some people are just looking for things to get triggered over and lots of people without kids are looking for reasons to make parents feel badly."
18391,I,N,F,J,"Maybe so, but he could’ve just said nothing right? Whether he looks or not is irrelevant. He made a point to tell her."
18392,I,N,F,J,Narc mom (bi-polar with psychotic episodes) and a long term terminally ill are parent. Bio dad was barely ever in the picture
18393,I,N,F,J,"You said that you’ve only been on meds for a few weeks. It generally takes up to 6 months for them to reach full efficacy. I can’t say anything about professional sports as I’m not an athlete. I will say personally my energy levels increased overall but joint inflammation makes exercise very difficult. Changing my diet has helped greatly but exercise continues to be different/difficult. The nausea can be a come and go thing as well. Remember, one persons experience - YMMV"

18400,I,N,F,J,She said on his nightstand as well. Also a photo album of all the pictures
18401,I,N,F,J,Fair enough - I still stand by my judgement. You’ve given hubs lots of places to make his own. But I do hope you work with your therapist as well for your own personal peace
18402,I,N,F,J,"NTA.  I’m not sure if people haven’t considered, but some people are photographed without their consent as children/teens in assault situations and can have PTSD type responses. Idk if that is OPs case but she stated her phobia is due to trauma and not like an OCD issue. I think a consideration like that may change the context in which others make a determination on this post."
18403,I,N,F,J,Can you ask to have them test ANA? My bloodwork came back normal while I was in a hospital bed for 3 days nearly incoherent. I don’t put a lot of stock in bloodwork for certain things anymore.
18404,I,N,F,J,I just kept being told “it’s normal” when I’d bring it up to my Dr. I had developed a tremor in my hand and my doctor sort of rolled his eyes and was like oh it’s just a benign essential tremor. You’re bloodwork is fine. So I saw a different doctor at the practice who decided to test for ANA. That got a big hit and the snowball was rolling. Now that I’ve been on the right drugs and lifestyle changes I feel a lot better.
18405,I,N,F,J,"NTA. Your cabin, your fun time, your rules. Life’s hard enough already, don’t let people guilt you into making it harder. Talk to Brad at least."
18406,I,N,F,J,"YTA from the stance of the interaction of OP/Child alone. Everything else, you’re not. I just don’t get how you can hold that child, feed him, play with him, see his first steps, his first smile etc - really the amount of effort as a man you’ve put into this human being and just torpedo it. You got off the hook financially and legally - rightfully so - that’s your horrible exes mistake. But wow, how can someone’s love, especially for a child, be so fragile? OP sees his wife’s horrible indiscretion in that child’s face, that’s all this is about. As a human being, I can’t imagine how it must feel to be told you’re not wanted by the only parent you could ever even remember. He is your Bio child’s brother after all."
18407,I,N,F,J,"I can imagine his Bio child wondering if OP could discard his brother like a piece of garbage so quickly, what about him?"
18408,I,N,F,J,I was so tired I thought I was dying - not like an exaggeration - literally dying. My hair was falling out in clumps. My skin was peeling off in chunks on my face and feet. I had nerve damage issues (I have Secondary Sjogrën’s) and couldn’t feel my feet or walk for a bit in the AM.
18409,I,N,F,J,I’m sure you feel exactly the same way about parents with cancer.
18410,I,N,F,J,YTA. Take some goddamn responsibility and grow up. Time for video games? Time to do your own laundry.
18411,I,N,F,J,"I wish I could help, but honestly i don’t know. I kind of gave up and started smoking MM instead with great success. So I just haven’t gotten to that point yet"

18415,I,N,F,J,"I wish I would’ve asked how Lupus is diagnosed (like how to understand my bloodwork and what they’re testing for)

Foods/Drugs/things to avoid (sunlight, heat, stress, garlic etc.)

What the meds prescribed do and what are the risks/side effects associated 

What symptoms should warrant a call/appt. It took me almost a year to figure out there were things that were like *Shrug “oh well, sorry, take some NSAIDS, see you in 3 months” and others that were like “Holy Shit why didn’t you come in??? Which was very frustrating because the messaging about what level of pain to tolerate is conflicting. 

A rough idea of what I can expect in terms of how my diagnosis/meds will affect my every day life. Just as an example: Based on the severity of my case do I need to think about making changes to my work? Should I move to a place without stairs because my joints are half destroyed or do I have 10 years before we get to that point?"
18416,I,N,F,J,Wanna bet that’s a twin bed too? The original bed his parents bought him in 1983
18417,I,N,F,J,"Legit. This is a “friend” who doesn’t have the balls to stick up for her when not just anyone but her HUSBAND, the man who is supposed to love and cherish her, denigrates her. She’s showing silent support for what He’s saying. OP should take that into consideration for the future of her friendship"
18418,I,N,F,J,"This sounds like a classic “Nice Guy” situation where he is incapable of expressing his own feelings, thoughts and needs so he seeks outside validation. This puts him in a constant state of superiority over you (in his mind) and victimhood because “you wronged him” but he’s such a “Nice Guy” he let it slide. It’s passive aggressive as hell, a huge betrayal of trust and honestly in that situation myself I would separate for a while. He needs to see a therapist to discuss his issues with you - not your friend group. Also, your friend is trash for not telling you or standing up for you."

18423,I,N,F,J,"I’m a personal assistant. I coordinate everything within the home from the Staff to the yard work, calendar management, travel and accommodations. I also do in home care for my Primary. I make sure everything else in someone else’s life runs smoothly ;)"

18425,I,N,F,J,"I do fine on HCQ, but have diarrhea on Plaquenil brand name. Plaquenil brand name seems to manage my symptoms better but tears my digestive system up. HCQ doesn’t do that but isn’t as effective imo. Maybe see if you can try HCQ instead"
18426,I,N,F,J,Food is a biggie with HCQ/Plaq. I get extreme nausea if taken without food. I was fortunate my doctor warned me.
18427,E,N,T,P,"I barely talk at all at home and while I do talk in public, it isn't much."
18428,E,N,T,P,"Hey, at least I'm not at the very bottom. lol"
18429,E,N,T,P,For me it comes in the form of being disorganized and forgetful.
18430,E,N,T,P,lol black sounds like an INTJ
18431,E,N,T,P,"Yep. Slightly ashamed to admit it, but I love when things go wrong and I can sit back and watch the chaos."
18432,E,N,T,P,"I do this too. Whenever someone gets hurt, or starts crying, or tells at me I smile and/or laugh. 

When I was younger I was the opposite - I would cry at the drop of a hat. I wonder if I've just switched out one emotional reaction for another."
18433,E,N,T,P,"I have this too. I talk too quickly and slur words together, so I often have to repeat things for people."
18434,E,N,T,P,"My self-esteem has definitely taken a few hits because of my social ineptitude and the things resulting from it. It's mostly that I'm so used to being put down, put last, etc that I don't expect other people to respect me."
18435,E,N,T,P,"I have ticker-tape synesthesia. Nearly all my thoughts are in words, but I ""see"" in my mind's eye the words spelled out as I think them.

I conjure up images of things if I'm thinking heavily about them, but only if I make an effort to imagine it."
18436,E,N,T,P,"I kind of like being stereotyped as an asshole. Don't think I am, though - not on purpose anyway. I do tend to ignore my feelings, but at the same time I can take others' into consideration before saying something stupid. Unless it just slips out, in which case I'm screwed."
18437,E,N,T,P,"I've had Ne all my life, developed Ti pretty early too. Making progress on Fe and Si is on the back burner for now, lmao."
18438,E,N,T,P,"Bold of you to make this claim without any evidence, or even criteria by which to judge.  Please enlighten me further as to your logical superiority."
18439,E,N,T,P,"Whatever fuels your unstable sense of self-worth is fine with me.

Why not ISFJ's, though?"
18440,E,N,T,P,"Thank you, your reply was extremely helpful. Right now I'm thinking he just has low self-esteem. 

Grey rocking sounds useful, I'll definitely read more into that."
18441,E,N,T,P,"Thank you. I'll definitely check out that video.

As far as I can tell he doesn't meet the diagnosis criteria, but then again now that I'm becoming more aware of who he is it's possible I'll realize he does.

Is it possible for narcissists to have empathy/ love their kids? My father has always been pretty affectionate and involved in my life, even in ways where it wouldn't be necessary if all he cared about was having a good reputation."
18442,E,N,T,P,"Being an ENTP, the problem is I'm simply too intelligent to converse with. I need to tear apart the idiots of the world.

That's the difference between you and I, ENTJ."
18443,E,N,T,P,"Your situation is pretty typical. I go to a relatively large school with a handful of kids with low functioning autism, down syndrome, etc.

I'm not sure if the teachers are allowed to disclose the student's medical history to the class."
18444,E,N,T,P,My best talent is making even the dumbest bullshit sound smart
18445,E,N,T,P,"Fuck yeah, I get to be the Joker"
18446,E,N,T,P,"I need to go ask my mom what kinda drugs she was on during pregnancy, lmao

I love being roasted almost as much as I love roasting others. More, please."
18447,E,N,T,P,But think of how much smarter you would be if you didn't watch Spongebob.
18448,E,N,T,P,"I can relate, although not to the same extent as you. I'm really sorry for what you're going through and have gone through. Your parents sound very toxic, and at 14 your brother is old enough to know better. I sincerely hope you can get diagnosed someday, you're so strong for making it this far through everything you've endured.

Like you, I'm ashamed of self-diagnosing but it's my only option of current. My mom is the most receptive and admits that there is a possibility I'm autistic, but she doesn't think there's any point in getting me diagnosed which I can understand since it's expensive. My dad, on the other hand, just laughs at me for ""diagnosing myself with everything"" and usually avoids the conversation entirely. Haven't even mentioned it to my siblings yet. 

I'm hoping to get a job soon so I can save up for a diagnosis, but because of the pandemic idk how long it will be."
18449,E,N,T,P,"I don't believe in good or evil. I believe in selfish acts which harm others and selfless acts which help others. 

People will always be selfish. In the end it's necessary for survival, to be a little bit selfish when the situation calls for it. Unless we evolve to a heightened state of empathy and/or compassion, maybe cure mental illness as well,  ""evil"" will never be eliminated. 

Personally I'd like to see less suffering in the world, but I'm with you that I wouldn't want a future where everything is perfect. All entertainment comes from conflict. All triumphs come from conflict. Life would be awfully boring without it.

If you want more suffering, then there are tons of options out there for you to be an a-hole."
18450,E,N,T,P,"I decided I would see if people treated me differently in Among Us if I wore a pink skin, pink hat, and named myself 'Laura' or smth. 

A dead body was reported; I commented 'Where?' 

Out of the blue the guy below me said, 'Women suck.' (Or something along those lines,  I don't remember that well). Someone agreed with him. 

I was completely confused as to what was going on until the vote ended and I realized I'd been voted out of the game."
18451,E,N,T,P,"Yep. Had no idea that was an aspie thing, but I do it all the time."
18452,E,N,T,P,I've been experiencing this lately. I've found that situations where I would expect to be furious in just don't effect me the way they used to.
18453,E,N,T,P,"I feel this. I crave praise, but once I get it I wish I hadn't since I never knew how to respond. And I'm always questioning whether or not they're being sarcastic and I feel like I sometimes respond like a jerk because I assume it's sarcasm.

Never considered that my upbringing would have anything to do with it, but come to think of it my parents were bigger on criticism than they were on praise so maybe that factored in. Idk."
18454,E,N,T,P,Is it bad that I laughed....
18455,E,N,T,P,"I'm sorry. I grew up undiagnosed so my situation is very similar to yours. My parents would mock me for things I now recognize as stings, tell me if I didn't change how I acted everyone would think I was weird, etc. Glad you're working to make steps in the right direction."
18456,E,N,T,P,"Thank you for the explanation! Intriguing to know I'm not the only one.

I always assumed it was something I developed once I learned to read, but then again, who knows? Would be interesting to find out if it's genetic or something you develop through experiences, although idk what would cause it. 

Out of curiosity, when you don't know how to spell a word, will you just not be able to see it? Or will you see the best spelling you can come up with? I need to come up with some words I can't spell to experiment, lol."
18457,E,N,T,P,"I never understood it either. I cringe whenever people talk about how ""basic"" or stupid neurotypicals are. All NT's are different and they aren't caricatures. Regardless of whether you consider your Aspergers a detriment or not, you're not above anyone because of it. And I doubt a disorder that often results in lesser social skills, and thus less mating success would be the next step in human evolution. It's kind of ironic though... making an illogical claim that you're the next stage of human evolution because you're more logical ;)"
18458,E,N,T,P,"I do, but for me I get more annoyed by excessive distress over things I perceive as trivial. I have a thick skin and I can handle insults well, and it annoys me to no end when other people can't. I get that everyone reacts to stuff differently, but sometimes I have to bite my tongue to keep from telling them to get over it since it isn't that big a deal. I definitely prefer people act calm and collected, lol."
18459,E,N,T,P, Lmao I love that. Totally sounds like something I would've done
18460,E,N,T,P,"I admire your attitude a lot, lol. Personally I didn't try to copy whatever one person in particular was doing, but whatever the majority was doing. I had my bar set far lower than 'popular', and even that was confusing af xD. So glad you've come to realize who you are instead of mimicking others; it's really admirable."
18461,E,N,T,P,"Ha, I feel you on both of those. I used to spend so long analyzing people's clothing choices so I didn't dress weirdly. It still never looked quite right, lol (my fashion sense is non-existent).

I used to force myself to talk in school so I wouldn't be labeled as the quiet kid. Then, whenever I opened my mouth and said something strange, I would be like, ""Why tf do I talk?"". lmao"
18462,E,N,T,P,Yep. Usually when I'm supposed to be whispering. lol
18463,E,N,T,P,I'll never be able to find another burger without sympathizing with its paim
18464,E,N,T,P,"As a kid I was shy, had a huge temper, frequent meltdowns, bad separation anxiety, and could never let things go. 

Now I'd like to think I've done a 180 personality-wise, lmao. I'm rational, patient, and it takes a lot to insult me. It's hard to pin down the exact thing that caused me to change - probably a mix of factors. Bullying and peer rejection, painful as they were, gave me a thick skin. I realized life was easier if I stopped giving a shit about other people."
18465,E,N,T,P,I would say mine is writing. I've written two novels before I was 14 (never published; just wrote them) and I've been told I write at a professional level.
18466,E,N,T,P,Listening to my friends talk about me behind my back and say they feel bad for me since all I do is follow them around all the time. That hit hard.
18467,E,N,T,P,"I'm a dog person, but I like cats as well - along with any animal, really."
18468,E,N,T,P,"In my case, I was blind to people blatantly disliking me - which later led to bullying when I stuck around them - and easily manipulated into forgiving the bullies afterwards. I thought that if I was nice to them, they would be nice to me. Turns out they only found that creepy and it only made things worse."
18469,E,N,T,P,"For whatever reason, I've found I share a similar sense of humor with some people with Asperger's. It's strange. Occasionally someone will tell a joke that only I was the one to get, or I'll do something intended as humorous that only they understood, and I'll be like, ""YES! WE CONNECT!"". Then later they'll drop that they're also on the spectrum."
18470,E,N,T,P,"I'm with you xD. I used to struggle with meeting people's eyes, then I made a game out of it and started analyzing their irises. Now the other person is always the first to look away, lmao. All or nothing."
18471,E,N,T,P,"Nice to know I'm not alone in this (although my connection is slightly different)! When I was 2 or 3 I begged my mom to teach me how to write, and I've been writing non-stop ever since. I'll sometimes speak aloud to myself just to hear the words; it's soothing to listen to. There are certain letter combinations I like in particular, such as the double 'c' in 'accident'. When I think to myself, I often 'see' the words flashing through my head as if I'm watching the subtitles on a movie. Occasionally they'll even have punctuation, lol."
18472,E,N,T,P,"No, you are not overreacting and it wasn't okay. I've accidentally gone too far with jokes in the past, but I've never refused to apologise because ""oh, my sense of humor is different"". Of course not. He doesn't have an excuse for being racist and you're not 'misunderstanding' him for finding it offensive."
18473,E,N,T,P,"It's fun when you can get away/ tell them to stop. My dad used to hold me down and tickle me until I felt like I couldn't breath, and that was torture. I'm still uncomfortable with being touched because of it."
18474,E,N,T,P,Looks like a mix. Might be some Lab or some kind of Mountain Cur in there?  V good doggo. lol
18475,E,N,T,P," Such a pretty girl. Maybe she's some sort of Australian Shepherd/Border Collie, perhaps with a bit of Lab thrown in there? I could potentially see some Novia Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever as well."
18476,E,N,T,P,"I've been interested in dogs my entire life. For as long as I can remember I've been obsessed with them.

I developed my interest in psychology later in life, and it was driven by a desire to find out what was ""wrong"" with me. Then I realized how interesting the human mind was and never stopped searching for more.

As for inducing it, I don't think I have much control. There are things I'm interested in, but I can't create the same unquenchable desire to learn more about them than I can with special interests."
18477,I,N,T,J,I’m a depressed INTJ with adhd....
18478,I,N,T,J,Yeah sorry mate this was just meant to be an extension of my previous reply. I replied to your question above in another comment.
18479,I,N,T,J,"This is a problem that syndicalism addresses, since market socialism is generally closely related with anarchism. Anarchism and its various branches, being pretty much entirely theoretical concepts, demand a lot of nuance when addressing practical issues, because it’s impossible for them all to be resolved by theory alone. This is a big reason why I am not fervently an anarchist or even a socialist. I agree with the moral sympathies of the ideas, but I find myself at odds with many of the practical issues that am simply ignorant of. I generally believe that practical matters should serve the ethical demands of a situation rather than the other way around, so I consider myself a socialist. That is the area I’m most comfortable with. I can say that market socialism combines many of the practical principles of capitalist economics that are well understood with the ethical principles of socialism. This means that it’s less theoretical than an entirely conceptual ideology like anarchism, because there is a genuine historical basis for its validity. Ultimately though, I wouldn’t grant myself any kind of political power at the moment due my ignorance of most practical matters beyond an intuitive level. Perhaps when I’m older I’ll have a better grasp of them and perhaps hold an entirely different ideology, but for now, I’m not confident in my ability to argue for the practicality of these matters on a case by case basis. 

That was very long and incoherent but thanks for reading it anyway."
18480,I,N,T,J,"For a book that is specifically focused on market socialism, the book *why market socialism? Voices from dissent* should suffice."
18481,I,N,T,J,"A market socialist economy is still principally a market economy, so it operates under the same ebbs and flows of consumption, supply and demand as classical economics. It’s just socialistic in the sense that the means of production(capital) are controlled by the workers themselves. It differs from more traditional kinds of socialism in that the movements of the economy are not planned by a central governing body, but by the demands of the market in order to allow for growth as in a capitalist system."
18482,I,N,T,J,"I can’t answer these with any depth in this comment section, but if you’re truly interested in this, I’d recommend *on anarchism* by Chomsky and *democracy at work* by Richard Wolff. I’m a poor replacement for these guys."
18483,I,N,T,J,"It’s beneficial in the sense that regardless of who you are, one universal basic need will be met for you. This will help some people more than others, but those that it “hurt” are inherently profiting off of the exploitation of people’s basic needs, which is unjust."
18484,I,N,T,J,"I consider myself a market socialist, but I’m admittedly not very fluent in economics, so I won’t argue with much conviction. Essentially the food would still be paid for, but by communities as a whole who’ve democratically elected to allocate resources towards paying for that food from the producers of it."
18485,I,N,T,J,"Commodification of food was a product of agricultural development and the urbanization that followed in the form of feudalism, but before that, tribes would share food communally, with those who could not provide for themselves having it provided for them. Of course those who are able but not willing to work would be kept from the spoils or even exiled. This is the general logic of the phrase, “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.”"
18486,I,N,T,J,"It’s beneficial in the sense that it eliminates any anxiety about not being able to feed oneself or one’s family. That doesn’t mean it’s preferable for everyone, because inevitably those that profit off of the current system would prefer it stay this way, but it’s still beneficial. I’d only want this kind of change to occur under democratic discretion, and preferably within contained communities where everyone’s interests can be accounted for and their voices heard."
18487,I,N,T,J,"That’s why I specified that people could have a basic standard, but you could still pay for higher quality goods if you could afford them."
18488,I,N,T,J,"Isn’t it kind of bullshit that we’ve commodified something that people literally cannot abstain from. There’s no freedom in that. Allowing everyone to have it would benefit literally everyone, and the best part is, we can allow everyone enough food to keep them alive, and still have better food options that people have to pay for if they want it."

18490,I,N,T,J,"Yeah that’s not a leftist thing. Leftists loathe this kind of liberal performative wokeness. As for the first part, that’s not what affirmative action is, and whatever that would be called doesn’t happen."
18491,I,N,T,J,"I’m happy you’ve asked! Leftism is a broad spectrum of ideologies, but it can generally be defined, in economic terms, as those having a negative or unfavorable view of capitalism. This is why most wouldn’t consider social-Democrats(or “democratic socialists” if you’re Bernie Sanders) leftists. Democrats and republicans both support liberal values, meaning they have favorable views on capitalism and seek to uphold it. Democrats are slightly left of republicans, but are ultimately still liberals and are still on the right side of the political spectrum. Leftists are usually pretty annoyed at being called liberals since they have fundamentally different values. Leftists also tend to have progressive cultural and social views, but this isn’t necessarily true for all of us. Remember, two people can have wildly different ideologies (ie anarchism vs. Stalinism) and still both be considered leftists."
18492,I,N,T,J,"That’s the thing. Most leftists don’t want full egalitarianism which would mean no outcome disparity. That is the strawman I’m referring to. I used to believe the same thing about the left, until I actually started talking to leftists and really trying to understand their position, and it converted me. I’ve been a JBP fan for many years, and I’ve only been a leftist for about one. I would fully agree with you if that’s actually what the left believed. I’m not going to claim that NO leftists want total equality of outcome. Of course those people exist. It’s just not what you would ever hear from any respected leftist thinker."
18493,I,N,T,J,I can’t even address how fucking inaccurate this is. You just demonstrated a subhuman misunderstanding of all of those things.
18494,I,N,T,J,"We don’t want to eliminate competence hierarchies, we just want everyone to have the same opportunities to climb them according to their abilities. We want people to have the same chance at success whether their parents are on welfare or are CEO’s of a Fortune 500 company. It’s got nothing to do with competence hierarchies, and that is one of the greatest strawmen Peterson perpetuates."

18503,I,N,T,J,Typical LEFTIST hypocrites getting mad when cops tear gas a crowd of protesters! Since masks are so great why did they care about the gas?😏

18506,I,N,T,J,I’m no fan of hers either lol. My results consist of a bunch of smooth talking ENTP’s for the most part which I sort of expected. I’m nowhere near as cool as those guys though😭
18507,I,N,T,J,Lot of INTP’s there. My results are mostly a bunch of ENTP’s which is probably why I thought I was one for so long.
18508,I,N,T,J,"Do you think finding out your score actually made the difference greater, or do you think you are just paying more attention to it now? You might even have subconsciously changed your behavior towards that which you associate with high intelligence. The last one sounds silly, but I guarantee it affects many many gifted people. It’s a sort of placebo effect."
18509,I,N,T,J,"Yes, but I felt that way before I took a test. I don’t feel all that different honestly. Maybe a little bit more secure in my abilities, but still lonely and depressed. The test just affirmed what I’ve always sort of known. People often say there’s no downside to a high iq, and I’d agree that it’s preferable to an average or low one, but the trade off is that it’s extremely lonely. I do know some very intelligent people with vibrant social lives though so maybe it’s just me."
18510,I,N,T,J,"Your iq is just fine man. At 130+ you can more or less go into any career you want. I’d say to just play to your strengths as much as you can. If you’re a numbers guy be an engineer or a physicist. Just find whatever keeps you engaged and pursue it in a way that doesn’t allow you to get bored. This can mean setting challenges that you feel are a little too much for you, or working on several different projects or even subjects throughout the day. The key is variety. You just have to mix it up so you don’t get bored. Medication is always an option but it’s not for everyone and it doesn’t completely solve the problem."

18512,I,N,T,J,"Cringe asf, but this is actually so me. I type in paragraphs almost exclusively. It’s so annoying that people don’t feel the need to articulate the claims and and assumptions they’re making in an argument."
18513,I,N,T,J,"The STP’s are a quite contradictory group, since they have tendencies to act logically(Ti), but also to just do what feels good at the time(Se)."
18514,I,N,T,J,Fe or Fi both work. They both feel the pain of others but it’s triggered by different things. Fe might react emotionally to someone’s feeling that they’ve been violated morally in some way. Fi will react emotionally when someone does something to others that violates their own sense of morality.
18515,I,N,T,J,"Very well may be. His Ti is super overestimated by a lot of people, since he generally just references other people’s work instead of using his own logic, though he can be logical sometimes."
18516,I,N,T,J,"I’d say he’s an intuitive with strong Si. Makes me lean towards INTP, since he’s obviously a thinker, and he uses his Ne-Si analyses of history and literature as the literal basis of his career. He’s also well known for his self help stuff which is predominantly based on building discipline and stability when it doesn’t come naturally which seems tert Si af."

I’ve been in the anime community for a couple years, and while other shows have been spoiled, ig ppl respect this series too much to do that to us lmao. I seriously have immense respect for the mangaka that wrote it. She’s brilliant at keeping the story unpredictable and thought-provoking whilst still keeping it super entertaining. She’s a rare talent."

18533,I,N,F,J,"Hey are you me?
I feel basically the same as you and I am a 17 yo guy who never had a girlfriend too. But I maybe have some good advice, that can help you with some of your problems. There is a trend called nofap where you try not to masturbate for a long time or ever haha. I wouldn't suggest it if I am not convinced of my own results. Let me explain that a bit further. I am on day 25 right now and in the last weeks my self esteem increased rapidly. I don't get a red face in awkward situations, I say what I think and I can talk confident with girls now. I don't credit it all to nofap, but it is like the motor who set these changes in motion. Maybe it also worked well because I believed in the positive effects, but nevertheless I think you should try it out since it can only do things better, not worse.
I hope you'll find happiness soon :)"
18534,I,N,F,J,Jokes on you I shower cold. Can't wait to get out there
18535,I,N,F,J,"Wow, I am actually shocked about what I read here.
I live in Germany and I just realized how good I have it here. I took most of the things like health care and security for granted.
Still, I am often unhappy with myself and the life I live.

18563,I,N,F,J,Do I have to introduce you to the basics? Idk what you want to say. Memers use common meme templates and add their text to it or reinterpret them. I created this meme and used the onion meme template for it. That's how it works. A repost means that I steal a whole meme and claim it as mine or I just add a small addition.

18575,I,N,F,J,Hahaha nice one
18576,I,N,F,J,No pinion
18577,E,N,T,P,That was merely one example... but based on the way you’re writing you’re not the kind of person I’d even bother trying to discuss this with.
18578,E,N,T,P,"I disagree, a masculine ENFJ could have a solid understanding of cognitive functions yet still type themselves as an ENTJ, for example. Knowing the functions is a good start but you need some degree of external feedback to know for sure, because many people are, apparently, blind to their ego function."
18579,E,N,T,P,You trollin’ though? That’s like the #1 prescription for people to mistype the fuck outta themselves. They’ll sue you for malpractice & you’ll be hanged by the council.
18580,E,N,T,P,"“Stfu I am smarter than you” ... “Mathematics surrounds me” ... NT?

(X): Doubt"
18581,E,N,T,P,"That’s if you subscribe to the belief we use the additional 4 functions in another stack (as per socionics), but I firmly think that wouldn’t make much sense though, because each function is coupled with another on an axis. As such I think types use their 4 functions, but are able to “mimic” the other 4 because Thinking is still Thinking, Feeling is still Feeling, etc. I don’t think Fe&Fi for example are two different isolated functions, I think they’re preferred uses of the same mechanism, but the result is an axis by which a diametrically opposed function is either balanced (if in your 2nd or 3rd slot), or naturally suppressed by your dominant function. Hence why Se dom guarantees Ni inferior, Ne dom guarantees Si inferior, etc."
18582,E,N,T,P,Aka when you realize stepping on Fe too much can cause a social avalanche
18583,E,N,T,P,"I wouldn’t be surprised, and ENFP’s seem to be the most overprescribed intuitive type of all."
18584,E,N,T,P,"Because it made Childhood more exciting, and kids used their imaginations from what Santa represents to extrapolate a far more optimistic and ideal version of what the world looks likd than the one that actually exists. I for one recall Christmas-time during the “Santa years” as among of the happiest of my life. 

(Too bad I was a nosy little shit & busted them before I was even 6)"
18585,E,N,T,P,"They benefit through feedback, and the more they see that people are benefiting from what they have to share, that usually manifests as an internal feeling of satisfaction or achievement."
18586,E,N,T,P,Se doms are usually higher in openness and so should be more (on average) willing to give type theory a serious look (as per the exploratory nature of those types) but I would concede that they’re less likely to dig deep out of pure curiosity and would be more concerned with getting a general understanding of what makes them/others tick/succeed.
18587,E,N,T,P,"ESTJ’s, and Te doms in general, seem to be among the types either least interested in MBTI or least willing to admit that people’s personalities can be accurately categorized."
18588,E,N,T,P,"It might depend more on functions... I feel as though a function like Fi or Te will be the dominant (ego function)s that are most difficult to see.

The other pattern (that I’m not certain of but pops up in a lot of what I’ve read) is that certain types (Se&Ni doms, Fe too maybe) have a high tendency to type themselves in reverse."
18589,E,N,T,P,"Depends just how turbocharged your Ne is but the main issues will be that one likes to do new things to stimulate themselves & is more comfortable with chaos. The other prefers control and typical requires more certainty & personal security.

Also... rules & norms. ISFJ’s can get extremely frustrated with someone who‘s prone to poking fun at systems, beliefs, or traditional etiquette."
18590,E,N,T,P,Easy for the Ti dom to say
18591,E,N,T,P,"MBTI is like the intro, the training wheels. It should never be the only resource you use if you actually want to know. But...

Sometimes one of the archetypes immediately jumps out at you, and thus can help you narrow things down quicker when you do further research. Either way, using regular-shmegular MBTI should be for getting a rough introductory sense of the framework, but functions & axes are far more accurate."
18592,E,N,T,P,"Te/Fi axis is more polarized & more rigid than Fe/Ti axis. Te/Fi believes more in objective truths and is sometimes referred to as the “angular judgement axis,” whereas Fe/Ti has been referred to as the “rounded judgement axis” because their judgements are more dependent on context."
18593,E,N,T,P,"Biased, but xNTP’s and INFx’s all seem worthy suspects when undeveloped but this is mostly everyone when they’re young"
18594,E,N,T,P,"If someone tries to give you life advice and their eyes don’t remind you of this picture, ignore them."
18595,E,N,T,P,Makes you uncomfortable because it’s part of your aspirational side
18596,E,N,T,P,My point is oxyclean gets the tough stains out guaranteed or your money back
18597,E,N,T,P,If I’m in that state indefinitely then I’d be wishing it were a furnace...
18598,E,N,T,P,Birth
18599,E,N,T,P,I think there’s a difference between having/using Fi vs. having it perpetually as your ego function.
18600,E,N,T,P,"No I mean the cognitive function axes. You should look into them. Ti doesn’t exist by itself in a box, for example. If you use Ti it’s automatically accompanied by Fe in the stack, because Ti & Fe form an axis, as do Te/Fi, Ne/Si, Ni/Se"
18601,E,N,T,P,"You should also look into the Axes. We’re used to talking about the types as a mixture of four random functions, but it’s perhaps more accurate to look at the sixteen types as different combinations of 2 intersecting axes. Our ego pulls us in one direction, our fears pull us in another, and this is something Jung hints at when he refers to the individuation process."
18602,E,N,T,P,"No you don’t... Fi in an INTJ manifests as desires. You can’t have Aux Te without also having Fi or else what is fueling your desire to attain your objectives? Te/Fi are on an axis, it should be looked at as a singular mechanism."
18603,E,N,T,P,Yes but art doesn’t build bridges or cure diseases
18604,E,N,T,P,Our entire universe could be a projection on the inside of a sphere
18605,E,N,T,P,"The difference is Right-Wing groups are already demonized all day long, meanwhile BLM has been forced down your throat and you’re racist if you criticize them."
18606,E,N,T,P,Both
18607,E,N,T,P,"Cat, Dog, Chicken

German Shepherds work pretty good in reality, but others like Platypuses are almost objectively useless."
18608,E,N,T,P,"But, is it *really* tho?"
18609,E,N,T,P,Why you guys pretending that tertiary Fi doesn’t exist
18610,E,N,T,P,"Not surprised, ours looks like a sock puppet"
18611,E,N,T,P,And now the riddle is settled...
18612,E,N,T,P,He’s wrong but also not wrong.
18613,E,N,T,P,ENTJ’s set the timer in the bathroom
18614,E,N,T,P,Well... because it isn’t. If Maury were here the lie detector test would have determined this a lie.
18615,E,N,T,P,Except that’s 21% of the population vs. 26% of the population. We’re outnumbered you fools.
18616,E,N,T,P,"Listen, I’m assuming you’re an IxxP because at this point you clearly aren’t going to back down from your view no matter what anyone says or shows you. So, continue believing that if that’s what makes you feel most... content? But the bottom line is your assertion is false. It’s a psychological disorder that operates independently of the ego or persona, however, based on its definition, ExxJ’s would be among the *least likely* to have it, because ExxJ’s by nature want to spend a lot of time around people... but social anxiety is an irrational reaction which causes people to *fear & avoid socializing usually to the point of isolation.* Like I said though, agree to disagree."
18617,E,N,T,P,"A) Cool, doesn’t change reality.

B) What part of irrational are you not understanding? It is not a matter of conscious control, one side of the brain is misinterpreting the situation regardless of what the other actually thinks or believes. Hence why it’s a matter of sensory experience, the more time you spend around people, the more closely you move towards a healthy version of your type, that type may still have it’s general fears and may either prefer to be with or not to be with people, but at least the conscious and unconscious mind will be in agreement about what those fears and decisions are.

THATS WHY ITS IN THE DSM AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER, NOT AS HEALTHY MENTAL FUNCTIONING. (since you whipped out the capslock)"
18618,E,N,T,P,"A) I’m not just talking about mbti... I’m talking in terms of Jungian functions. Plenty of IxxP’s would also type as IxxP’s whether its mbti, socionics, OPS, etc. Not all, but plenty.

B) It’s you who isn’t understanding.

Definition of Social Anxiety: A chronic mental health condition in which social interactions cause irrational anxiety.

“For people with social anxiety disorder, everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, and embarrassment.”

The key word is *irrational,* it’s an irrational response and operates independently from conscious control. It doesn’t matter how much you care about what the group thinks of you, but rather how inclined you are to feel irrationally anxious or overstimulated around others."
18619,E,N,T,P,"My definition of social anxiety is different from yours. I’m not referring specifically to a “fear of being judged” because the primitive side of our brain isn’t rational or conceptual. I’m using the definition social anxiety on its face, aka *a general feeling of anxiety in social situations.*

By fear of being judged by others perhaps you mean insecurity, but I disagree there as well. Confidence in identity means confident in your thoughts & feelings, but that does NOT MEAN confident in social situations. May I refer you to r/intp or r/infp so you can read some accounts for yourself? Any type can have social anxiety, however, the less time you spend around people, the less sensory experience your brain has in social situations, this is why the brain creates anxiety, it is literally confusing a social situation for a dangerous circumstance with predators. This anxiety response can occur regardless of whether or not the person gives a shit about what other people think of them. Ixxx types will be most prone, particularly in xNxP types. (Ne users are some of the most prone to both anxiety & depression)"
18620,E,N,T,P,"You’re using anecdotes, I’m telling you how it actually is. I don’t know what else to tell you. Anyone can have social anxiety, IxxP’s tend to have it more than others. Makes sense, ExxJ’s typically spend a lot of time around people by nature, so naturally as you spend time with people your brain will learn not to treat others as a threat. People who mainly keep to themselves (such as IxxP’s) will be *MORE* likely to have anxiety in social situations."
18621,E,N,T,P,"But social anxiety is by definition not being by oneself. IxxP’s are internal deciders, meaning they’re confident in *their own internal frameworks,* but in a social setting where behavior is more dictated by tribal norms, cues, etc. they are forced to act according to *external frameworks,* and thus is why these types have higher rates of social anxiety. ExxJ social troubles usually revolve around a desire for external validation or status."
18622,E,N,T,P,"Definitely IxxP’s, especially IxTP’s due to inferior Fe."
18623,E,N,T,P,"A) This is false.

B) This is true."
18624,E,N,T,P,"1. I’m not republican, & climate hysteria is both a mixture of valid science (hence I’m pro-sustainability because that’s common sense, since we’re already aware these changes are mandatory given the finite nature of fossil fuels) and political manipulation (climate fears can be leveraged for votes, obviously, if you think democrats don’t exaggerate climate-related issues in attempt to consolidate more support you’re a fool). Biden’s son however was cozying up with Ukrainian oil companies, and all major corporations want Biden to win to maintain the status quo. As for gender, I don’t honestly don’t care.

2. Trump hasn’t “embraced Russia,” in fact tensions escalated early in his tenure in Syria, they also have a larger nuclear stockpile than we do so how would you prefer we handle them? I don’t know why you think Democrats would be tougher on Turkey or the Saudi’s unless you want more American troops deployed back to the middle east?

3. “Far-right” Judges? I completely disagree, feel free to elaborate on it. As for packing the court, that’s a bizarrely hypocritical thing to say after Biden has repeatedly refused to deny that he would be packing the court.

4. High-tariffs resulted from China’s trade shenanigans, but I don’t want higher tariffs. Closed borders while we have an ongoing pandemic and the highest spike in illegal immigration in years prior to him taking office? Curbing illegal immigration is completely reasonable. As for “draconian treatment” please acknowledge child separation policy and “the cages” had been in place throughout Obama’s administration, & dismantled by the current one.

5. Where’s the disenfranchisements? And which voter suppression? Be specific. How about the democrats’ blatant voter fraud? Why are they all pushing mail-in ballots? Are you truly so gullible as to believe their are zero massive security concerns in that highly flawed system? You need to snap out of it, it’s clearly going to create a legal shitstorm.

But go ahead & continue being a pretentious ideologue, our political system may be screwed but it’s obnoxious people like you who allow our broken 2-party system to survive."
18625,E,N,T,P,Now respond to everything else. I’m not even a Republican in name. Never voted republican in my life though this year I’d happily do so.
18626,E,N,T,P,"Ok A) No idea what a RINO is. B) The party has not “moved so far to the right,” it’s essentially exactly where the left was 40 years ago. What you would call “the center” has been dragged miles to the right. C) Faith? Are you implying I’m religious or something? What an assumption"

18635,I,S,F,P,"I wonder too. Also I wonder about games such as

18647,I,S,F,P,Geocaching?
18648,I,S,F,P,No just taking feeding bags through it via prescription
18649,I,S,F,P,Maybe just playing with an instrument? Like a ukulele or guitar?
18650,I,S,F,P,Music in some form. I know he has hearing issues but maybe louder volume?

18662,I,S,F,P,I watched sonic as a kid. Like 2003 is this something else
18663,I,S,F,P,The link doesn’t work. It’s an empty file?
18664,I,S,F,P,This is about digital :)
18665,I,S,F,P,I tried it but hated it and made a mess.
18666,I,S,F,P,I feel like that too. I can spend hours playing bingo and some game but felt frustrated at how wasteful it is of time. I’d like to see your creations I wish I could colour. I found it a useless hobby to colour because for starters I didn’t like it and once I’m done with it it’s like “wtf do I do with it now”
18667,I,S,F,P,Maybe digital collage. Only need a free app like piccollage. Or you can take pics you like and print them and plaster with vegan glue on a large sheet of paper.
18668,I,S,F,P,That’s cool!
18669,I,S,F,P,Solved
18670,I,S,F,P,Thanks

18734,I,N,F,J,I'd love this. Maybe not melee only but pistol only would be fun xD Sometimes all I can find is pistols at the beginning of a game. And I'm always up for zombie killing.
18735,I,N,F,J,"Just a question, how do you know it's a bot? I mean besides how they act when looting, what really gives it away? I've read that most of the times they have a bunch of ___ in their name but that's all I've really seen."
18736,I,N,F,J,"lmao THIS. And then I get called trash because I got stuck with a pistol and maybe a shotgun. My squad even loaded in Fort San Diego once and somehow, no matter where I went, it was all PISTOLS. And only one teammate stuck inside with me so I know they didn't take everything."
18737,I,N,F,J,I think I ran into these two about a week ago. It was the other one that got me but they were both playing as Itz and I could hear them both come up into the windmill. Killed one but the other got me right as I turned to shoot at him -.-
18738,I,N,F,J,"Not my partner but I've got one for my stepdad.

He was sleeping on the couch and I think my mom and I were reading jokes on the computer or something. This was like 20 years ago so it's a little foggy but all I remember is my mom joking ""ewww who tooted?"" and all of a sudden my stepdad is raising his hand in his sleep. We lost it laughing and had to go to another room so we didn't wake him up.

Edited because I curse like a sailor xD"
18739,I,N,F,J,"Among many of the others listed here, I also love the complete soundtrack for [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeVFrt7BUyw) - The Will of the Wisps one is good too.

Also shout out to the [Gris soudntrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxM1SX35-GU)"
18740,I,N,F,J,I hadn't even heard this one! I love Nannou personally but this one is beautiful as well. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
18741,I,N,F,J,"> Idk if it’s because of how freaked out the ending of Requiem for a Dream left me but whenever I hear it I get so panicky, it’s like a visceral reaction

I feel like this too but mainly because people who post conspiracy theory videos LOVE using this song. lmao I already have anxiety and this just amps it up. I love it a lot but I can't really listen to it often."
18742,I,N,F,J,"This is my absolute fave as well. It used to be on a Hoyle card game and I immediately fell in love with it. I haven't found anything that compares to it in the way it makes me feel. 

Erik Satie's Gymnopédie (all of them) is second choice."
18743,I,N,F,J,She really is! I tell her every day (several times a day xD) how beautiful she is. Thank you for your comment!
18744,I,N,F,J,"Checks out for me! I have to ""see"" things so I prefer to read or watch videos. If someone explains something to me verbally, I usually ask them to draw it out if they're trying to explain what something will look like. Or if they are reading off instructions, I just ask them to hand it to me."
18745,I,N,F,J,Right?
18746,I,N,F,J,"Same. Half the bad INFJ + all the bad INFP ._. when people say they are very similar, they aren't joking lol 

But on the plus side, those positive aspects aren't so bad ;3"
18747,I,N,F,J,"Lol this is making me question that nearly 50/50 I had on INFJ/INFP. One time I took the test I had 51/49 lol but lately it's been like 64/36 so... plus everything else always fits when it comes to INFJ. Maybe just my bad traits are INFP and my best ones are INFJ? XDD I'M KIDDING. I'm obviously the ~rarest~ type. I'm too much of a perfectionist. 

In all seriousness, I've done the research time and time again. Definitely INFJ."
18748,I,N,F,J,My mom and I were the same way (I'm female). I thought it was kind of normal until I realized it wasn't lol I never got why it was taboo. It's just a human body. Maybe it's just an American thing? We're always so ashamed about nudity. 🙄
18749,I,N,F,J,was there at 9:58 when I refreshed and it was stocked.. was waiting 35 minutes.. got an error.. refreshed and just now got the heaven's gate lip gloss but not the palette or the other liquid lip I had in my cart ._. Glad I grabbed some other lippies a couple days ago!
18750,I,N,F,J,Like a mother rhino giving birth to Ace Ventura. Though probably less funny and more terrifying.
18751,I,N,F,J,"This. Or like Dying Light, be able to hit a key and it will show an icon over the body or pile of whatever it ends up being. I like the suggestion of beeping too but I hope it's not an actual beep and is more like the bobblehead or magazine noises. Beeping would drive me crazy lol"
18752,I,N,F,J,holy shit.
18753,I,N,F,J,These are all perfection <3
18754,I,N,F,J,"Those all sound amazing. I'm pretty sure my mix of photos is 55% mobs in weird or glitchy poses, 43% landscape, and 2% selfies xD I haven't actually taken too many of me posing with creatures (besides the wise mothman). I'd love if we were able to put photos in our camps somehow, even if it was just 5-10."
18755,I,N,F,J,"50 max? I'm on PC and definitely have more than 50 :x I do have to move them to a new folder sometimes though, as I believe too many eventually starts crashing me."
18756,I,N,F,J,Beautiful. I think that's my dream one as well. I currently have the Bloodied 10% aim 90% reduced weight one. Still very nice but definitely not FFR nice. WTG!
18757,I,N,F,J,LOOOOVE. I also love that you have so many people dressed up. Picture perfect!
18758,I,N,F,J,"It's somewhere around Vault 76, IIRC."
18759,I,N,F,J,This is seriously an amazing shot.
18760,I,N,F,J,"I wish they could do something like this. Like I understand server lag so maybe max it out to 5 or 10 photos, tops. But I have SO MANY photos xD RL hobby photographer carries over into games too. I have a group I call ""Feral Funnies"" with the ghouls landing in funny positions. xD And ""The Teddy Chronicles"" with all the teddy scenes I've come across."
18761,I,N,F,J,lmao. My fiance is like that too. He has so many of the low level quests I told him he'd probably level 10 levels just by finishing all of them. And he's level 92 now.
18762,I,N,F,J,"I launched one at level 100 as a celebration, I guess. I will eventually because possum badge. lol Or was it a tadpole badge? Either way, I like completing achievements/challenges. It was a pain in the ass the first time but I'll probably have an easier time this go around. Maybe I'll do it when I hit 200? XD I'm 180 atm. I did solo first time around. Maybe I can bring my fiance with me this time since he's of a good level. But he probably won't want to xD"
18763,I,N,F,J,There's usually a military ammo bag on one of the party tables in Sons of Dane Compound. :)
18764,I,N,F,J,I need to record my snallygaster heads at Toxic Larry's. Seriously good fun. XD This is great!
18765,I,N,F,J,Love it. Had a similar thing happen with a super mutant at the lumber mill lol
18766,I,N,F,J,The years start coming and they don't stop coming
18767,I,N,F,J,"Damn, I should have done this. xD Great shot!"
18768,I,N,F,J,I feel this way about all of the Halloween decorations. I was finally able to decorate my camp the way I wanted to. Halloween Night. lol
18769,I,N,F,J,"M-n is who I reported, I wasn't sure about M-s but he was the other one I had seen in that round."
18770,I,N,F,J,"when I encountered him and was watching him after my death, no one was around him. if I had seen him more than once and noticed a pattern of other users with him,  I would have."
18771,I,N,F,J,I reported him. recorded video of it and everything. there were two M names that got a lot of kills but the one dude was literally running with no cost to ap and was running through rocks and shit.
18772,I,N,F,J,I know but a good chunk are xD
18773,I,N,F,J,My fiance had to name his underarmor that because he kept scrapping the Shielded Urban Scout Armor I made for him. -.- I have one more backup and then I told him he's on his own next time lol
18774,I,N,F,J,I love all of these. Huge SN fan.
18775,I,N,F,J,"I'm not appropriate with some of my names, and for some reason I named my first few with a B so all my power armor and legendary guns are named with a B now lol


Back the fuck up - any shotgun. Currently TS33.

Beastie - any dragon. Currently either Bloodied or TS. Can't remember atm xD

Be Sneaky - JK. - My Hunter Explosive Shot +1 Agility Fixer. Can't be sneaky if you're exploding shit haha

Bloody Explosive Bitch - (traits self-explanatory) LAR

Boom Boom Bang - TS M79

Boom Boom Pow - TS Missile Launcher

Blackbeard - Ultracite PA

Bluey - Nuka Quantum PA

Bumblebee - Excavator PA"
18776,I,N,F,J,"Yes. But if a friend is on the server you can ctrl+tab and respawn to them. But that's literally only command I could do. No map, no esc, nothing except the ctrl+tab."
18777,I,N,F,J,"Maybe it depends on the display case? I was able to put a PA chassis in the tall glass display.. lol it was ridiculous. But can't do Jangles! 

Also, I know it'd probably be a lot on the server but I wish we could display our power armor that we have painted lol would love to be able to set out one of each type or something. Or even just a limit of 2 or 3 armors."
18778,I,N,F,J,Not sure I get what you mean? lol if I don't need something it gets sold haha I have random cooking ingredients in stash and duplicates of magazines in there. I'm just saying it really sucks to have to scroll through 100 items before I can even get to the non-display items. xD
18779,I,N,F,J,"I'm sure there is, and I had a lot of mods for FO4 but I'm looking for mod-free stuff here considering the game already still randomly refuses to let me in after a glitch, saying ""Disconnected due to having modded game files."" Or whatever the message is. It hasn't happened in a good minute but still lol

And by mod-free stuff I just mean hoping they will implement better categories into the game at some point."
18780,I,N,F,J,"My personal bugs with the challenges is more that the dailies are a 50/50 chance of already being done when I sign in for the day, therefore, as you said, not receiving Atoms but for challenges that are ""already completed."" This has happened so many times since launch, I probably have missed out on 10k Atoms by now. I do have a few actual challenges that are incomplete still that I'm hoping they will continue to retroactively fix (some of the explore in Toxic Valley and whatnot). I also have 9/10 for Grognak but it's showing 8/10 (I've collected every magazine twice to make sure). I know they fixed the cooking recipes one but I've noticed they are slow to fix challenge bugs in general, probably so that people will buy Atoms. I hadn't even seen the comment about them switching the rewards for new players. Ridiculous."
18781,I,N,F,J,">  then I would personally stream on twitch, removing my eyeballs from head

Shouldn't say shit like this lmao Just insert foot in mouth instead ;)"
18782,I,N,F,J,">  less Atoms for challenges

What? What did I miss, where?"

Believe it or not, many companies use Spring or some kind of Jax-RS based web framework for Java Development. You'll have no trouble finding a job related to Java Dev with Spring Knowledge in the future.

It sounds more like you're just not feeling Java backend. Consider changing the type of development you do; I'm personally learning IoT in case I ever wanna switch out of backend work.

What I would suggest, if you are still interested in Java/WebDev, is check out [https://quarkus.io/](https://quarkus.io/) and some other up and coming alternatives to Spring Boot. Get really good at understanding the nuances of SpringFramework, what Beans do, where specific errors come from while working with Spring, etc. I have a feeling Java Devs with Quarkus experience will be in high demand in a year or two once some of the larger companies realize how shitty Spring Boot is."

18790,E,N,T,P,"My INFP friend is stuck in a Te grip where he feels as if he has no worth cause society has defined the ideal person as being very different from him. He's stuck on how the system will never change and rules are rules and how everyone else has already defined who he is (so he thinks) And it depresses him cause he views himself as unable to fit in no matter how hard he tries

How can I encourage him while he's battling this?"
18791,E,N,T,P,I mean I break out into sporadic dance a lot and I love to pass knowledge to others. My biggest struggle is conforming to others whom I grow close to and staying true to myself

18794,E,N,T,P,When people don't camelcase in Java
18795,E,N,T,P,Sounds like these people are not very balanced. They need to develop their Fe before taking a leadership role. And their Si needs to be developed enough to efficiently delegate to others who can do the administrative stuff better than they can

After that, my modem just randomply sopped connecting to the internet for a day. It seems like every other day the internet works, which is really bizarre. Same with the cox hotspot in my apartment complex; it goes out every other day and is honestly one of the most painful things especially during COVID.

And their technicians are so backed up that i have to wait a week after my start date to get internet? Like cmon. Cox in areas with other competitors is nowhere near this inconsistent, but it seems they don't care about the customer base in locations where they have a monopoly on internet service. Cox in Norfolk, VA, do better please. And don't spend 3 hours after i waited 1 hour on hold for tech support telling me to turn my computer and modem each off and on again 5 times."

(2)INFP: The friend you can tell just about anything without any judgement.

(2)INFJ: The friend who will make you feel good about yourself, acting like they want to hear what you have to say. We have similar interests, but very different personalities.

(2)ESFJ: The friend who is generally a pleasant person. I don’t have much in common with them, but we can still have a good conversation.

ENTP: The friend who is just like me! The friend who will always match my energy- my only friend who is truly as crazy as me. 

ISFJ: The friend that is easy to forget about but still always there to talk. 

ESTJ: we can insult the fuck out of each other and still be friends the next day. This friend has no passive aggressiveness, because none of their aggression is passive. Refreshingly mean.

ESFP: Friend that is only my friend when it’s convenient for them. Bounces around like 5 friend groups. Has an enviable amount of confidence."

BTW, developer to a budding developer, 
Its fantastic what you have achieved over this year. The more dedicated you are towards the craft, the more you will achieve. 

Some tips:
Focussing on Maths can help you, but the right type of math, like abstract and logical one ( logic and statistics) can give a good push to you for computational programming, like Deep learning, Image processing. 


Github is great to document your code work. 
Keep pushing your work there, and some day you may not even have to show your CV at job interview, let your Github profile do the talking. 

And lastly, try to prioritise which field in Programming you want to push your focus in, like Frontend, Backend, Dev-Ops, Networks, Big Data etc.. 

At beginning try everything, but dont be ""Jack of all trades, Master of none. """

19136,I,N,T,P,"Te is the more pragmatic thinking function, to them its ""it just needs to work"" as long as it ""works"" they don't mind. Ti is more specific and has a detailed logical framework of how it should work, you can often see this in how they ask a question in response to a question, because the original question was too broad. So I'd definitely go with INTP."
19137,I,N,T,P,"I have extensively studied functions, and you having a ""loud voice"" doesn't change much, a more numerical people will take up naturally more job positions, both high and low in a corporate or otherwise hierarchy. Also yes those are generalisations I am aware not every single intuitive is like that, but that said a majority are, with sensing functions taking up the third and fourth position, they will likely pay less attention to details in exchange to focusing on the broader concept aka ""the big picture"". Also just because we have no evidence of them running society its easy to put 2+2 together and reach a conclusion if they make up an overwhelming majority of people in the world they also make up a large majority of people with jobs in the world."

19145,I,N,T,P,"That depends on your view on death, also you are a collection of experiences and memories processed in a certain manner which is possibly pre set genetically, and the sum of the conclusions you reach about those things."
19146,I,N,T,P,"Its not about the masculine household mate or how you were raised. You see IXTPs have a little thing called inferior Fe, that means that they will compress/hide emotions and act stoic outwards while being really neurotic on the inside. This happens because of the inferior Fe, they are not used to expressing emotions externally its like a foreign concept to them and they refrain from it, this usually culminates in an emotional outburst whether it is ungodly anger or crying. Although your household likely hasn't helped your unhealthy emotional state."

19150,I,N,T,P,"Soooo, its been one hour, did you do it yet? Or did you stay true to the INTP way and didn't because we are too cowardly to do so."
19151,I,N,T,P,Agreed.
19152,I,N,T,P,"Well make no mistake we have a deep imaginative Ne world like all NPs, but perhaps it does, now if we were going of the notion that it does, it wouldn't present much of a problem, as we are used to having a certain cognitive pattern of thought, which large ammounts of emotional stimulus is not usually a part of so we are generally ok and happy with it, infact I would say large ammounts of emotional stimulus while sounding like a delight to you, poses and issue for INTPs as we don't quite know how to deal with or incorporate emotions properly, thus we get overwhelmed in a bad way and mentally paralyze not knowing what to do then become neurotic in a negative way with extreme feelings of anxiety, nervousness and even paranoia in some cases etc."
19153,I,N,T,P,"Well, lets say for the sake of argument gender does have type impact (at least I think so...) in the common dichotomy of females leaning more towards warmth and expressiveness and Males towards coldness and internalization. So now that we have established that you might be more expressive with your Fe  meaning you might lash out about his certain overstepping of boundaries and 2 faced tert Fe and you just want some peace and quiet, although I think both sexes of INTP  will get mad about it, they may approach it  and react different ways. So this does not indicate you are by any means necessarily a feeler. Especially if its pointed at them any INTP will get generally pissy about such behaviour. Now from my understanding of ENTP they very much like to poke and prod or do social experiments with people, as for the best way to resolve it setting boundaries is a de facto foolish move as ENTPs like to tease and will constantly hop around said boundaries, no you're going too have to imply a more reactive solution, aka angerly lash out when he pushes past your tolerance level and not just any anger as mild anger and dislike will merely make them happy and laughing in your face, knowing they've fished out the reaction they've wanted, no you're likely going to have to shock him and lash out like an aggressive chimpanzee, once its visible that you've surprised him with your reaction, isolate yourself and give him time to think, if he doesn't approach you after some time you approach him and be more diplomatic as he will be more open to discussion that way. If he truly loves you he will avoid pissing you off to that point again granted he will still poke and prod but will refrain from doing so past the tolerance level thats established. Now I know this sounds awfully immature and emotionally manipulative and I will explain why its as such, see ENTPs like to play with fire and they will keep upping the level of danger until they get burned only then will they stop. In this case use this as a last resort if things become unbearable. As I don't recommend using it casually."
19154,I,N,T,P,Roblox manages to be a goldmine for socially akward interactions perfectly describing the INTP.
19155,I,N,T,P,"Our thought process of Ti Ne Si is more like, Ti causation and Ne correlation Si memorization its like ""a is because of b which could also mean c is because of d and I know that because of e""  there are other ways we think of course in different circumstances but that is the general thought pattern. The difference being is our thought process is more robotic/mechanical we think like that because of our internal system of logic which we continuously upgrade. For INFPs its more emotional or like a spark connecting things because of Fi Ne Si thus its like an emotional flood of stimulus which carries connections and memories its much more fluid, you associate things based on your subjective feelings about them."
19156,I,N,T,P,"As far as I know, he is an INTP, I was told he said so when asked about his mbti on that long QnA video, but I will conclude INXP larping as ENTP. I am not sure whether he is an Fi user or a Ti user. On one hand he mocks and messes with worldviews while trying them on like gloves, not really taking them seriously like an Fi dom would regarding beliefs/morals, the poorly edited videos of his also seem like a testament of NTness not taking his so called art seriously or putting effort into it passionately merely treating it as a jokeful parody which is why I think he uses Ti-Ne. On the other he doesn't have much problems with outright displays of emotions which would discomfort a lot of INTPs, and he certainly values his own identity and extensively self reflects while pondering his internality as seen in videos such as deep personal lies not too much of a Ti doms trait as Fi is quite low which is why I think  he uses Fi-Ne. Of course this is us guessing based upon his ironic/not ironic/ meta ironic statements not really knowing which one is which and what his actions mean. What we do know however is that the persona he puts up is overly ENTP, overly ironic and constant parodying of beliefs, with a spice of edge."

19294,E,N,T,P,"It doesn't matter that's how. A lot of things we agonize over don't actually matter and you're inflicting pain on yourself for what? 

The way it works for me is I start judging the actual result to see if my actions were good or bad. Minor mistakes like that don't really matter unless it's a document that needs to be exact.

Also as humans we will make mistakes in fact we are constantly making mistakes or doing things wrong it's just a longer or shorter break before we start fucking stuff up. With that as the reality have some empathy for yourself. Also you won't grow without making mistakes in fact a perfect being seems to be the most boring think I can think off.

Own up to your mistakes, accept them. You gotta accept yourself as you are. The desire to not make mistakes or feeling horrible for mistakes won't fade but at the very least you won't be overcome with guilt or shame when stuff like that happens..

Also read ""The complete Enneagram"" by Beatrice Chestnut that helps so much. 

Good enough is good enough (at least sometimes)"
19295,E,N,T,P,"I guess something some people don't take into consideration is that let's say my type ENTP and my exs type ISFJ have the exact same cognitive functions that are conscious. Now specifically for ISFJ their dominant functions is Si and ENTP's ""weakest"" function is Si.

As it is that the ISFJ's dom function they won't judge you for being bad at it they'll just think you're weird. Same with ENTP and Ne.

Another point is that specifically for ENTP and ISFJ each of the aux (parent functions) and child functions (tertiary) are switched so if the two people are willing to grow/learn and realize that the focus of the first two functions aren't the only valuable considerations it becomes a thing where they teach each other and will even seek each other out to be taught by the other.

Also something I've noticed is that types with the same 4 cognitive functions that are in their conscious 4. All view the world in a similar manner. If you think of the cognitive functions as specific filters it just becomes a thing of noticing that those types value the same filters as you but prioritize different ones.  Communication between these types ESFJ ISFJ INTP ENTP should be easy and smooth cause they all speak the same ""language"" even if they focus on different things when we get to specifics.

ENTP and let's say ESTP will struggle cause they don't value each others dominant naturally in fact it's so far as they will have cordial relationships but always feel like they're talking past each other. They'll feel a sense of respect for each cause of TiFe though.

Opposed to an ESFP which an ENTP just won't get. Or the ESFP won't get the ESFP cause there isn't a natural respect for the other seeing as the types value filters that are completely different to each other. It will feel as if the other person prioritizes or doesn't think properly."
19296,E,N,T,P,People are simply failing to understand the nature of what's presented.
19297,E,N,T,P,"Look for a book called ""The Complete Enneagram""
By Beatrice Chestnut 

Or ""The road back to you"" 

Or ""The Enneagram of Everything""

I've found the most comprehensive and the one I enjoyed the most is the COMPLETE ENNEAGRAM for both the explanation of the theory behind the enneagram and the accurate type descriptions.

Reading it you start to realize that a type is a mix of different things that result in that type.

Also if you easily related to the type 4 description then you're probably a Soc 4 cause the descriptions are usually based off that 4"

19301,E,N,T,P,"True word. I'm always telling myself I gotta pick my ""battles"" so to speak cause it's not even worth trying to change someone's belief seeing as we can't factually say who's right or wrong.

It's interesting to entertain the notion of someone else beliefs of which oppose yours and try and understand how it would all work or what it would mean in the context of your own life. I'm pretty sure if it's true then I'm going to hell lol."
19302,E,N,T,P,"Ye it's a different look at the MBTI types beyond just the dichotomies. 

I can send you a link to read about it if you'd like. I found someone who compiled information about it who's explanations I agree with"
19303,E,N,T,P,Lol
19304,E,N,T,P,Socionics is so Ti heavy it's kinda ridiculous
19305,E,N,T,P,"We do though it was weird. We were separated in our youth and only made proper lasting contact now it's weird getting to know her cause it feels like she's my twin. We're 10 years apart in age (she's older) it's been amazing. She's taught me so much about how to engage with Fe and she doesn't even know MBTI that well. She didn't know about it till I recently told me. 

Lol I respect her a great deal and our interactions are very revealing about a lot.

So thank you for that. Gave me kind of an opportunity to share lol"
19306,E,N,T,P,Perfectly said.
19307,E,N,T,P,"Personally I've found that if you're an intuitive dom you'll be comfortable fluent with both but font respect the other.

It's like speaking English and German. Being fluent in both but not respecting German enough to want to use it unprovoked."
19308,E,N,T,P,Context matters especially so for feelers. Everything is contextualized so there's a right place and a wrong place and wrong time and a right time to say stuff. Everything you say could be true and they will react badly if the context is wrong. This is a lesson I learned and it made my life so much easier
19309,E,N,T,P,You sound like my sister of whom is also an INFJ lol this was eerie to read
19310,E,N,T,P,Lol you're right but didn't deliver this message in the best way.
19311,E,N,T,P,Very well put and a lesson not easily learned.
19312,E,N,T,P,You right lol. That's a very pragmatic approach I gotta remember that. That's a good way to approach it
19313,E,N,T,P,I always struggled with religion cause they told me just have faith which can be loosely translated to I like this shiit and me saying I don't like it or believe it cause it's fundamental axioms don't make sense in the context of the rest of the theory. It's kinda funny.
19314,E,N,T,P,You're very cool for this and I appreciate you
19315,E,N,T,P,"Yes, you're right. I also know exactly what you're talking about. Lol I was raised in a religious home."
19316,E,N,T,P,"I assume cause you devalue or don't respect feelings as a reason as to why people do things. The sooner you accept that the easier shit becomes. (Like I said I'm assuming that's why you're always debating) if we're anything alike which we should be.

When thinking I.e Reasons are pushed far enough they turn into feelings but my vice versa. 

Logic is a tool. Logic can only help you decide how to do something when you've decided what to do and how to you decide between to equal and largely similar options? Feeling.

What you like dislike, what makes you feel good bad. What makes you feel strong weak. Etc"
19317,E,N,T,P,I'd further say why is ADHD/ADD so high amongst Ne dominant types. Is it truly a disorder or natural variance in brain usage.
19318,E,N,T,P,"You can be a medical professional and still be wrong if the basic premise of your basis for why something is wrong or in need of ""adjusting is wrong"" something like ADD who's to say what the right amount of ability to focus is correct or even should be considered correct. Medical professionals are gods they're humans who can also be wrong."
19319,E,N,T,P,ENTP 4w5
19320,E,N,T,P,"Well ENTPs are first and foremost perceiving types. They're logical only in service or in relation to how they approach the world through the dominant lense of Ne (potentiality)

INTP's are logical first and only then are they open to potentiality of an abstract nature"
19321,I,S,T,P,"Rearrange the letters and its segel, a type of bird"

19382,I,S,T,J,They are ! 🤗
19383,I,S,T,J,NTA you are going through a rough patch and it’s not like you’re being unsupportive. It gets depressing to hear constantly about someone else succeeding while you’re trying to get your life together. Your friend should be more compassionate and self aware about what she says and how often she says it
19384,I,S,T,J,She doesn’t need all the filter this is sad
19385,I,S,T,J,Surprised the dog isn’t blurred out too
19386,I,S,T,J,YTA and are very ungrateful. God damn.
19387,I,S,T,J,I didn’t even have to read the rest to tell you NTA. It’s yours. Period.
19388,I,S,T,J,Eh this was a long time ago I haven’t worked there in a year but just wanted to share my experience . The job was stressful enough that I didn’t want to be bothered after my shift was over
19389,I,S,T,J,I completely understand where you are coming from. I am not at all a fair skinned woman I am more of a tan complexion/ get fairly dark when I get sun tanned. This variation was perfect for me because I felt like most of my old boxes were for fair skinned women so I can understand the feeling.

Considering that I hated June’s Luxe Box and that they gave me a bronzer pallet that matched my skin tone (I’m a medium tone) + gave me stuff I’d actually use... I ain’t mad. 

Would I continue BoxyCharm...? I don’t know yet but I ain’t mad at this box 👀"
19391,I,S,T,J,Idk how she could call him a deadbeat but always dub him. He always ‘calls at the wrong time?’ God damn then tell him when it is a better time to see the kids.
19392,I,S,T,J,McKayla acted like the world revolves around her
19393,I,S,T,J,"I understand where you are coming from. I did not tell him that I didn’t want to shoot there specifically because of how I felt about it. I just told him that I did not feel like it worked with the aesthetic. * For example me dressing more formal and posing somewhere less formal *We were supposed to polish up the details for that reason and maybe see if we could get a common ground. I would never actually say that it was because that’s where new people shoot to the photographer. I’ve just shot there many times before and did not want to do that again 

But however his lack of communication was a lot more prominent than mine, and I’ve never had this issue before. I always ended up reaching out more and asking more questions regarding it."
19394,I,S,T,J,Honey needs a moisturizer
19395,I,S,T,J,"I always ended up following up with him and I felt like he too had to do it at least once. I didn’t want to be the only one putting in the effort especially since there had been times he didn’t respond to me, regarding shoot details."
19396,I,S,T,J,I love how a majority of the girls looked at McKayla crazy for getting pregnant twice ;and then the cycle got worse for a good chunk of the rest of them
19397,I,S,T,J,I got it but for some reason it dried out my skin not in a way that I like. I have combo/oily skin and it had this weird little bump effect under my dark circles. The color match is good but ehhhhhh na I’m sticking to my Nars Long Lasting foundation
19398,I,S,T,J,I think it was your old shampoo. I feel like doing mini swatch tests can tell you if it was going to react on your head. You don’t have to apply the whole thing on in case of reaction
19399,I,S,T,J,Yet this is the maturity preacher right here
19400,I,S,T,J,I can finally participate in the naked palettes group without paying full price
19401,I,S,T,J,I need something like that because I have the same issues regarding combo but oily t zone! I’ll check it out thank you 😊
19402,I,S,T,J,Thanks!
19403,I,S,T,J,"You can definitely do that. Because those companies think we don’t know anything and we can’t get solid photos for a comp, they push for shoots and preparations. They assume people don’t have good enough photos so they push their own photographers to make bank. I had enough photos from my portfolio to work with and had my significant other do it for me"
19404,I,S,T,J,I wanted to spit out my water when I first heard him
19405,I,S,T,J,"And Tim is an asshole because he makes Caelan look like a dick when he’s not. He just goes w whatever McKayla says. And that’s not fair like Caelan is actually making an effort. He works over 12 hours a day and wants to see his kids and wants to make it work. Like wtf. McKayla isn’t working and wants him to work and be as hands on as her. How could he not resent her? She wants to reap the benefits of having 4 extra hands, and yet have Caelan magically be super dad. Like an octopus working and taking care of the babies too and the many puppies god damn."
19406,I,S,T,J,I am applying it directly on the skin and it does kind of pull a little foundation but not enough to ruin everything. I tried putting concealer on after contouring but it kind of low key ruins it but I think I’ll try what you suggested. I love the matchstick and don’t want it to waste. 🙅🏻‍♀️
19407,I,S,T,J,"Hey ! I’m 22F and I understand where you are coming from. I’ll add to what was said but also give a testimony. I lost about 7 pounds at the beginning of the corona for similar reasons( over sleeping under eating). 

What worked for me because I feel the same way as you is to gradually increase calories but in a way that doesn’t make you uncomfortable. I’m not much of a big eater either but I made sure I ate 3 meals and added a scoop from a protein shake (about 600 calories). That’s a slower way of getting more calories without constantly feeling full. Gradually I added little snacks here and there. 

Now I have a scoop before breakfast, a light breakfast. Then lunch, then another scoop and then dinner. And I have some snacks in between. Eventually your body will get used to it and you won’t get overwhelmed."
19408,I,S,T,J,Yeah that’s normal. I have the same thing with one eyebrow and not the other. It just happens
19409,I,S,T,J,HAHAHAHA THIS COMMENT GOT ME DYING
19410,I,S,T,J,Go on SHEIN they got like a pack of sponges for different prices
19411,I,S,T,J,I do background acting and freelance modeling :)
19412,I,S,T,J,"Yeah because a test shoot is just to see how you work the camera. It’s a test shoot for a reason. If they push you then I think it is a red flag. They just want to see if you have natural abilities that’s why it isn’t a paid gig, it’s a *test* if that makes sense. So why get classes for a *test* or *trial* shoot ?"
19413,I,S,T,J,"Why do you have to fork over money to take posing classes that they specifically want you to take? 

You could find one on your own and then test shoot. 

It’s always a little fishy when they want you to either shoot with their specific photographer only or making you pay in general for things you can get on your own"
19414,I,S,T,J,"Fit me by maybelline is great because it has a wide range of shades and isn’t expensive. They also have different kinds for skin types. It’s also including SPF for skin . I started with that because I have medium skin and never found anything that matched. Then I upgraded to Nars Long lasting foundation which is more expensive, but it never runs out and is great"
19415,I,S,T,J,I once had a teacher tell us she was holding off sex because she and her husband were fighting. Had another one tell us that her husband cheated on her and gave her the papilloma virus
19416,I,S,T,J,Yeah it’s 2 step verification. It’s used a lot like for PayPal or just in general for emails or things that you need your phone for. In some cases it’s good for yourself . However ya never give it to someone else
19417,I,S,T,J,With the verification code you can reset someone’s credentials for emails and such and basically reset everything
19418,I,S,T,J,I replied to someone else! But I hope you get whatever you are suffering from worked out
19419,I,S,T,J,That’s really good to know! I think I will pursue the bikini area and then using whatever else I was using like veet for everything else. In the end it really is aesthetic wise and I wouldn’t want to get hurt. I appreciate your input and your testimony of trying it yourself. :)
19420,I,S,T,J,"You’re completely right about waxing a different area first. I’m definitely going to try it. I have considered going to a professional but it’s just personal preference of not comfortable with it. If that makes sense. Plus I feel like I can handle my own pain tolerance. If I fail miserably then hey. I was thinking of using different waxing methods. Like for example regular wax for Brazilian and then wax strips for other areas. Especially if the hair is different textures like mine. Thin leg hair, thin armpit hair etc."
19421,I,N,T,P,"Dem kann ich so halb zustimmen, einerseits ja, man muss damit klarkommen können wenn man von nem Idioten überholt wird, andererseits könnten diese Idioten auch einfach erst dann überholen wenn es sicher ist. Da ich mit meiner Simme immer auf ner Bundestraße zur Schule muss hab ich schon so einiges an ""interessanten"" Überholmanövern gesehen.

Und zu dem Zitat: Ich hasse diesen Stereotypen, klar gibt es welche die sich ein teures Auto nur kaufen weil es teuer ist, es gibt aber auch genug Leute, die in anderen Bereichen ihres Lebens sich sehr zurückhalten um sich ihr Traumauto leisten zu können."

19423,I,N,T,P,"This joke is dark, just as dark as the place the kids will be in, in a few years"
19424,I,N,T,P,"Well, as I am German myself and basically research about historical topics half of my free time I am quite certain that I know what I am talking about. 

The SS itself was still voluntary, the only branch that started drafting men was the Waffen SS which was not responsible for the concentration camps and officers there were also only volunteers. However the Waffen SS was still responsible for other horrible war crimes like killing all inhabitants of a village because someone resisted the occupation or burn down every village they come across during their retreat and so on...

But as I don't want to be the ""Bro trust me bro"" kind of person here is an [article](https://www.planet-wissen.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/die_ss/index.html) that I used as a source. It is on German so you may need a translator but it sums it up pretty well."
19425,I,N,T,P,"I didn't say that ancestry isn't cool, what I mean is that I wouldn't really mention that someone who took part in commiting a genocide was part of my family. The SS was voluntary it's entire existance so anyone who took part in it was there on his own will, which makes the whole thing even worse to me at least."
19426,I,N,T,P,DU
19427,I,N,T,P,"That isn't really something I would like to mention to anyone, especially on the internet."

Left wing theory consists of some of the most rational writings you will ever find, most of what was written down by left wingers in regards to what would happen in the future is beginning to happen now.

But I can understand your ""Commie bad"" viewpoint as you probably base your opinion on the things you have heard and read so far. The more information you get the more your views change. Ohgod I did the rant thing again"
19434,I,N,T,P,"Somehow I managed to be Auth Left, the theory was too interesting to not read it"
19435,I,N,T,P,"How did the INTP end up there? Most INTPs I know are left wing, and Einstein, the most prominent one, was also a socialist, so what is going on there?"
19436,I,N,T,P,Good luck on having such a massive amount of troops in the himalaya... The logistics would be an absolute nightmare. In such a scenario the attacker is always the one who would loose.

19443,I,N,T,P,"Nothing, I didn't really expect you to read all of that, considering the other ""arguments"" you used above."
19444,I,N,T,P,"You are aware of a thing called appeasing the masses?  


The German communist party was a huge opponent to Hitler, the only reasons why they didn't win the election were:  


1. Their arguments were too complex for the general public  

2. Anti-Semitism was big in Europe so a party that made it into its party program was bound to have success
3. The Weimar Republic itself went against the communist party
4. Hitlers party was more populist. They gave the people simple answers for complex problems. Oh and obviously the obligatory ""No, they are the baddies, we are the good ones"" talk without any arguments to support their claims.
5. Their denounciation of  the Treaty of Versailles, which was hated by the german public at that time.

A few other nice facts to show that they weren't socialist:

1. They killed, kidnapped and imprisoned union leaders and generally left leaning people
2. They first banned the leftist parties, then the rest
3. They abolished workers unions and only created a symbolic state run union that did basically nothing except propaganda
4. They had huge plans in privatisation, only things that were needed to ensure their power were not privatised

For more information just ask me, I am german myself and study history quite intensely, so I think I have quite some knowlege about the topic.  


Yes I had to write the obligatory leftist textwall."

19448,I,N,T,P,"Well, If they sensor the shit out of it how come that basically anyone I talk to knows about it? Although most of them barely know anything about it except some article made by an american that can't even speak Chinese and gives no sources."

19454,I,N,T,P,"Guess why they are copy paste? Because Gaijin doesn't give them their indigenous equipment and rather implements a glorified M113. 

Players screeching copy paste as soon as something there even remotely looks like an already existing tank doesn't help either."
19455,I,N,T,P,When Gaijin finally decides to give them some more Leclerc Variants so that France is actually competetive. Same goes for China and Japan. At least France and Japan get a radar SPAAG...
19456,I,N,T,P,"You don't seem to understand what I mean, with NVD I meant that at night the thing is almost unusable, with the cannon I mean that unlike other Helis here you have to move around a lot to still have it hit something, which according to the G91s I have shot down works. And for the ATGM, I have seen countless Apaches or G-Lynx kill enemy after enemy with their Hellfires within mere seconds, meanwhile most KA-50s I see spawn, fly for a minute until they get yeeted by three AA units and some Jets because they are too stupid to simply lock onto the jet, press the space bar and simply hold visual contact. At least I have stopped using the Ka to kill tanks. I rather keep the air clean with it as unlike with the Tunguska the missiles of the Ka actually do damage. 

It seems like you think I am denying that it is very strong which I am not. The only thing I can't stand is that apparently the Peten which is way better for killing tanks, is seen as almost non problematic even though that thing annoys me far more than some Ka-50 that accidentally spawned at night and sees nothing. I bet if China gets Helis and they get a remotely good premium heli people are going to screech around that Gaijin would be bowing down to the CCP or something... But who knows what will happen in 5 years when Gaining will probably actually add them...

Edit: it really seems like people dont get my point. Yes the Ka-50 is very strong, but so is the Peten. But I guess the hivemind guides the way..."
19457,I,N,T,P,"Well, that is mostly the case because the missile is all the KA has. The cannon? Small angle of fire. NVD? Nice joke. Thermals? What is that? Firing more than one missile simultaneously and aim them? That works? Shooting a missile that finds the target itself without needing you to look at it? That exists?

Compared to the Tiger and Apache the KA-50 is trash in any situation that isn't against other Helis. Against tanks the Hellfires and PARS are better and in night battles you can forget about using the KA-50. There only the KA-52 is usable. When playing tanks I would much rather see a KA-50 than a heli with Hellfires or PARS. At least with the KA-50 there aren't 10 missiles going down at you within like 3-4 seconds.

Note that I still dislike Helis, mostly because they are badly implemented and either tank every shot or are way to fragile. (Alouette surviving 10 hits meanwhile the Mi-24 goes down after one of the two turbines goes yellow)"
19458,I,N,T,P,"The more patches the Type-69 II (a) stays hidden the more I want it... **GIVE IT ALREADY, IT IS ALREADY ON THE CHINESE CLIENT**"
19459,I,N,T,P,Am I the only one too blind to spot a tank at a range further away than 3km? I mean mostly I use the KA-50 as Anti air as the missiles there actually hit and do damage unlike those from the thunguska. But going on a bombing run is also fun.

I know it is just some random online test but still, is this a healthy result? I mean sure I am really anxious about a lot of things, have barely any motivation and think that most people only want to harm me at some point, but is this really that weird?"
19461,I,N,T,P,Even though I got a stroke trying to read that I can approve the message
19462,I,N,T,P,"Eh, I lost that hope but I use my friends as test subjects to see what could happen if I do different things"
19463,I,N,T,P,"Well, as long as I can force others into doing it I am fine. Other than that I have to agree with you."
19464,I,N,T,P,"With horrible, do you mean our complete incompetence to actually flirt?"
19465,I,N,T,P,"I mean, one side having ideas and the other putting those ideas into plans sounds like something that could work. I mean I just forced a friend of mine to go out with a girl he likes as he didn't do it himself. I basically threatened that if he didn't do it I would tell her. I mean he hates me now but at least he will do it. Meanwhile he knows he can't do that stuff to me. My social incompetence is too high for that."
19466,I,N,T,P,What if an INTP is the wingman?
19467,I,N,T,P,"I would definitely go for the HEAT, I guess my understanding of it is just very broken because of the stuff that I have been told. Thanks for the new and better information though"
19468,I,N,T,P,Then it seems someone told me a lot of nonsense. So what is the reason that modern tanks even use HEAT-FS? It seems to do less damage than APFSDS and can also penetrate less armor. What is the need for it then?
19469,I,N,T,P,"The thing with HEAT is, that in reality it oneshots tanks, because the temperature inside the tank, that got hit, gets so hot, that the soldiers basically instantly die, when a HEAT penetrates. If HEAT would do realistic damage, it would actually be usable, because if you pen you would at least have a reliable kill."
19470,I,N,T,P,"Thanks for the great analysis. And this basically also confirms that I am an INTP. I am very quick at laughing when someone fails at something but I am also quick to help for two reasons: 

1. It is the right thing to do

2. If I don't, they won't shut up and I hate to hear people complain or cry"
19471,I,N,T,P,"Just have it be an option so everyone is happy. If you want to play with NPCs forever go ahead. But online increases longevity, and if it's optional then who cares just play your story mode"
19472,I,N,T,P,"Just have online separate from single player and boom everyone is happy. I don't understand why people don't want to meet new people in hogwarts, which would make the game feel alive instead of NPCs, have quidditch tournaments/ matchmaking, explore with friends, and duel! It gives the game more longevity after you played all the houses 100 times. And people gotta stop coming every online to gta. It's not all like that."
19473,I,N,T,P,But the single player mode would be done... You have an optional feature.
19474,I,N,T,P,"Just have it be optional so you can have fun with your NPCs. online also helps with longevity. When I play like harry potter servers on minecraft it's so alive with lots of players, imagine meetings in your houses with real players. Online dueling clubs, quidditch matchmaking systems, It would be sick. And if optional it's a win win. Don't see the complaining really."
19475,I,N,T,P,Because I want to meet new people and have it be OPTIONAL so for some baffling reason others don't want to duel others or hangout in common rooms and such and make new friends.
19476,I,N,T,P,Yep I did this too and saved bank
19477,I,N,T,P,Sold my quest for $300 yesterday
19478,I,N,T,P,That's why I said I HOPE. As in in ADDITION.
19479,I,N,T,P,Can't wait I hope they add a multiplay area so I can hang out with friends from other houses and quidditch :D
19480,I,N,T,P,This was really good!!! I tried it out and it was easy and enjoyable :)
19481,I,N,T,P,"It's tough because I don't like to cook, and my dad won't get freshly where it's just natural foods and you just heat it up... Also I just have been feeling low energy latley and tired. So it makes doing walking and stuff unfulfilling. I just wanna be less lazy and eat healthier. Another thing is I just wanna feel full, sometimes after eating a meal. Ex. Chicken breast and fries and beans, I'll be back 5 minutes later after eating and quickly which also leads to heartburn."
19482,I,N,T,P,Who could of seen that coming shocker. glad I'm home with my refund chillin
19483,I,N,T,P,"I have Ms. Reynolds. But like I have had a history of having problems with math ever since middle school and have struggled all the way to the end of my time at community college leading me to drop stats and fail a quantitative literacy class.. I have had an awful relationship and with ADHD on top of that it's impossible and frustrating and having a dad who is great at math tell you ""you learned this in middle school"" over and over leads to learned helplessness. I'm great in other subjects but I can't get behind or vibe with math. I've done everything under the sun to try and help myself. Granted atleast I don't have to take calc."
19484,I,N,T,P,How do you take classes at other colleges online?
19485,I,N,T,P,What accomodations do you think I could get besides more time?
19486,I,N,T,P,My major is Psychology and it's college algebra that's required
19487,I,N,T,P,No like I have ADHD and I am pretty sure I have dyscalculia. And I did this math thing over the summer so I could get in MAT 111. But I kinda skirted it.. because I wanted to quickly get into 111.
19488,I,N,T,P,Luckily I got a full refund :) I'm back home now
19489,I,N,T,P,"Awful, being apart of the UNC school system in NC is very bad. They won't give refunds in case of closing. Luckily I got out of my housing contract."

19496,I,N,T,P,Is this game hard?
19497,I,N,T,P,I assume you get a lot of hours out of it I hope?
19498,I,N,T,P,Is it difficult?
19499,I,N,T,P,Any really fun games that seems to have hours of content? An RPG style game would be great

19507,I,N,T,P,Any good  Salicylic acid products? Preferably on Amazon?
19508,I,N,T,P,Yeah my skin is darker but I just want sunscreen so I don't get darker and what should I use for dark spots and small bumps?
19509,I,N,T,P,Is the L'Oreal one bad? It seems to do quite a lot
19510,I,N,T,P,Any good skincare products for men with light oily skin? (I think my skin is more on the oily side but I don't really have any acne anymore just very time bumps that you can only see when viewed up close.
19511,I,N,T,P,Idk why people think a Twitter mob is the majority
19512,I,N,T,P,"Exactly this, I don't know why people can't understand that this in addition to a single player mode would make both people happy. NPCs are ok and all but I wanna connect with new people and hang out in the common room."
19513,I,N,T,P,But again what do you expect to do when you bet the game?
19514,I,N,T,P,That's why I said in addition
19515,I,N,T,P,"Uh I choose my house which is Ravenclaw, I don't like that people label houses as popular. I feel it should align with your personality type instead of choosing a house just because."

19595,I,N,T,P,"Or maybe they just wanna break stuff without repercussions? People here on Reddit have done nothing but praise CNN for their coverage on this peaceful protest. Now they're just some MSM whenever it's convenient.

""I may have been called 'a modern Attila' and 'a Robespierre on horseback' by the other sovereigns; but if they would search their hearts, they would know better. Had I really been that, I would perhaps be reigning still. But one thing is certain: had I been such, they all would have long since ceased to reign.”

Napoleon’s government was the first one in post-revolutionary France that didn’t make a habit of guillotining their political enemies. He stabilized the economy, suppressed brigandage, extended rights to religious minorities that other European countries wouldn’t for decades and did quite a bit to try to bring peace to Europe. He made a peace with Britain that THEY broke, and married a Habsburg, in part to make a lasting peace with Austria.

When you read about his estimated IQ, you’re reading intellectually masturbatory Einstein fanfiction.

At any rate, I sincerely doubt that Einstein’s IQ was that high, given what we know about his academic performance. But, what do I know, take it from an IQ expert, here you go:

> “One fundamental problem with the estimates I've seen is that they tend to conflate intellectual ability with domain-specific achievement,” explains Simonton, who in 2006 published a study in the journal Political Psychology in which he estimated the IQs of 42 U.S. Presidents.

It's become so cliché now that in virtually any story featuring an advanced AI it/they always seems to inevitably achieve, or want to gain, consciousness as if that's the most natural course of action and then comes Watts who shits all over that and basically rebuffs the notion that intelligence is supposedly always asking whether or not it could be conscious but never stopped to think whether or not it should.

It's definitely made me look at AI in other series completely differently. I'm sure people think the hosts in Westworld became conscious in the end and here am am now thinking maybe they all became p-zombies instead. Then again if you can't tell the difference, does it matter?"

Everything else is just peripheral blur, just— light and motion. Motion draws the focus. And your eyes jiggle all the time, did you know that, Keeton? Saccades, they're called. Blurs the image, the movement's way too fast for the brain to integrate so your eye just—shuts down between pauses. It only grabs these isolated freeze-frames, but your brain edits out the blanks and stitches an — an illusion of continuity into your head.""

It scares my brainstem to death....  I think I know what's happening back on Earth, and though some might call it genocide it isn't really. We did it to ourselves. You can't blame predators for being predators. We were the ones who brought them back, after all. Why wouldn't they reclaim their birthright?...Not genocide. Just the righting of an ancient wrong.""

Yes the glitch is still there... or is it? You'll have to read the sequel to find out."
19780,I,N,T,P,"An important part of the story is around the superiority of non-conscious intelligence which applies to vampires but they went extinct from a quirk of evolution; their cross wired eyes killed them off when humans started making crosses everywhere. Basically humanity won out by being lucky and not because our form of intelligence was better than theirs.

By the end when Siri realises vampires have taken over Earth he describes it as ""the righting of an ancient wrong"" meaning the natural pecking order is finally restored to how it 'should' have been from the start; vampires, non-conscious intelligence, rightfully the ones dominating our planet just like the rest of the universe.

19800,I,N,T,P,Season 1 has got to be the surprise show of the year for me. So happy season 2 is out so soon.
19801,I,N,T,P,Blindsight has a novel resolution arising from its more central thesis on consciousness.
19802,I,N,T,P,"Ha, ""bit."" It's definitely an improvement over the standard edition Dune in almost every way (except for the logo) but imo it's at least 25% overpriced for what you get compared to their other limited editions. This is without doubt an attempt to cash in on the film hype, not that I'd blame them, they need the money considering their gloomy yearly financial results of recent years."
19803,I,N,T,P,"If you don't care about plot or concepts then I wouldn't bother. Book 1 and the first half of book 2 are pretty similar in scope in being earth-bound narratives but the characterizations don't improve, in fact they get worse in some aspects.

However once you hit the second half it becomes more of a space opera and continues as such into book 3 so if you happen to also like that sub-genre it's probably worth giving it a try in that case though as mentioned don't count on character development improving, they all remain cardboard cutouts. I'd also add if you're tepid on trying book 2 but don't want to get roped into the third then you don't need to worry as book 2 ends well enough on its own."
19804,I,N,T,P,">
“To be a poet, I realized, a true poet, was to become the Avatar of humanity incarnate; to accept the mantle of poet is to carry the cross of the Son of Man, to suffer the birth pangs of the Soul-Mother of Humanity. To be a true poet is to become God.    I tried to explain this to my friends on Heaven’s Gate. “Piss, shit,” I said. “Asshole motherfucker, goddamn shit goddamn. Cunt. Pee-pee cunt. Goddamn!” 

I never knew language could exude such beauty."
19805,I,N,T,P,"Blindsight. You know how you often hear the odd NASA engineer etc say how they got into their field because they were inspired by Star Trek etc? I feel like if I had read Blindsight earlier in my life it would had inspired me into neuroscience, then again I think at that impressionable age I'd have been too stupid to get the book.

It has ruined a lot of other sci fi for me in how deep it runs with a single core theme in which the entire narrative structure is built around and just runs with it without letting up or hand-holding one bit. It's tough but so rewarding and has certainly infected a good chunk of my waking thoughts on the topic of consciousness and what it's good for after having first read it and against earlier this year and again right now and will be again when the fan film adaptation comes out in a couple of weeks."

Then I'll put something in the oven and continue reading then eat. I tend to wait maybe half hour after eating before reading again because I find it hard to concentrate when gorged. I will then read again for a couple more hours until bed time.

I read almost exclusively hardbacks and as I use to pc game a lot (not any more) I am use to a desk environment which is also convenient as I can use it to rest a book pillow on for my heavy hardbacks. I never read on a couch or bed, nevermind the issue of how to sit with heavy hardbacks, I find comfy positions makes me fall asleep, I don't know how people can do it."
19811,I,N,T,P,"It's a true Pothos plant. Almost everything posted on this sub is an Epipremum, mostly the aureum species which used to be classified in the previous century as Pothos Aureus however it later got reclassified into the genus Epipremnum but the name Pothos stuck and nowadays most people associate those two together despite no longer being scientifically correct. Plants from the true genus Pothos are very rarely sold so it's pretty much a unicorn."
19812,I,N,T,P,Stop judging an adaptation on how closely it follows the book. If you want something faithful to the book then read the book. Film is its own medium with its own considerations and a good adaptation will take inspiration from the source material but shouldn't follow it.
19813,I,N,T,P,I can almost feel the radiation.
19814,I,N,T,P,"Got a very insightful response from the seller:

>It would absolutely be fine in soil! It has nice and rather thick roots for its such delicate foliage, but I’d leave it alone for a few weeks to let it not be too stressed out. Water when it dries out like any other aroid, and make sure it has something to climb/cling on like the moss pole if you do move it into a terrarium. I’d definitely keep it in a higher humidity environment. I never tried keeping it out in the open nor have I seen anyone else do it but I reckon it’s for a reason so I wouldn’t risk it unless you’re much more courageous than I am! And as for propagating it yes! Cutting from higher up will absolutely be fine, especially if the moss it’s on is kept wet so the aerial roots will already be healthy and very easy to adjust. Hope this helps!"
19815,I,N,T,P,"Depends on what kind of cloth. Their buckram is as sturdy and durable as any leather binding though I personally don't like the plasticy feel. Their other cloth bindings that aren't treated will obviously be more delicate but unless you're handling them on a daily basis they can easily last you decades.

As for the binding style they're almost always smyth-sewn and never glued so again it'll last you quite a while though some of the heavier volumes will be prone to sagging over time. In general though where it comes to the premium end of the mass market book segment they're the best, anything beyond and you're heading into fine press territory."
19816,I,N,T,P,"Best to go to dedicated book forums, the Reddit demographic isn't really, shall we say, financially inclined to be regularly splurging on these price brackets.

[The Librarything Folio board](http://www.librarything.com/groups/foliosocietydevotee) will keep you up to date as well as their [fine press forum](https://www.librarything.com/groups/finepressforum) that covers a range of publishers though not as up to date with everything given the breadth involved compared to the aforementioned dedicated Folio board.

There are also some other forums that specialise in other publishers like Centipede or Suntup but unfortunately I don't frequent those so can't help here but you might be able to scour google for it."
19817,I,N,T,P,"Not entirely sure, still waiting for the seller to get back to me on exact care. It was described as a terrarium plant suggesting it may need some degree of humidity and the setup as shown is how it was sold. I peeked into the root system and there's no hint it was ever in soil so likely grew entirely in moss. I'm keeping it as-is for the time being so it can acclimatize."
19818,I,N,T,P,Lucky find off ebay UK and had a fierce fight with someone over it.
19819,I,N,T,P,"Normally Folio tend to reissue standard editions in more expensive offerings which in the past tended to be in full goatskin, not the same cloth binding as the original but with a different design. For that reason I'm not thrilled at the price especially since it's only the artist's signature. It's a shame they decided to re-release it instead of securing the rights to the sequel to coincide with the film. 

That said I do find this design much better than the relatively boring silver of the original design, seems far more thematically appropriate."
19820,I,N,T,P,"Nope, came with the plant. The moss is a little raggedy round the back so suspect it was actually a DIY job but from the seller."

For me personally the only way I really express these emotions is if Luke in a song there’s a scream coming up and I’ll scream along with it . Drain you by nirvana at least in the Live and Loud version has a very loud scream infact so loud he gives off feedback but yeah . It’s not that I don’t know what I’m feeling I just don’t know how to convey it or sometimes it’s so powerful I just feel words themselves aren’t enough to be able to convey what I’m trying to say.

19933,I,N,T,J,"All the Ladies we have seen killed so far have died either on Halloween, aka Immortal Cannibal Brawl Night, or in a special magical space created explicitly to be a deadly battleground for Summer and Winter, though. In Cold Days Harry didn't know where to even start with killing Maeve until Bob told him about the special rules for Halloween. I'm sure there are other exceptions. For example, a lot of us and also Harry thought Nicodemus was really after the Spear of Destiny, and we thought that its special power was that it was able to kill immortals (In mythology, it was a blade used to stab Jesus after he was crucified).

Also established in Cold Days is that if the island had blown up when it was not Halloween all the evil immortals inside would have temporarily lost their bodies, which would have delayed their return, but that they *would* have been able to reform with time.

I do think the Ladies as well as Mab have 'real' immortality, it's just that being knocked out is still a very bad thing when you have things to do, and there are always exceptions.

If Mab had been killed with some special weapon, Molly would indeed have become Queen. Beyond not being ready to do cruel and necessary things, some of us speculate that the Queen has to sleep with their knight at least once (Else why would Mab bother in Changes? She's very practical minded, just magic up a contract and make him sign it in blood), and with the torch Molly has been carrying for Harry for her entire adult life, being forced to force that would *not* have been good for her sanity or their relationship. 

As to how Mab expected him to carry out the killing, well. The details were probably not at the front of her mind in the moment, but either use the Spear of Destiny (She plotted with Hades to get specific artifacts out of the vault) or wait for Halloween. Molly might not have lasted as Queen, but she could perhaps be expected to remain sane until at least the next Immortal Purge Night."

Me making a few hundred bucks is more important than you staying alive."""
19936,I,N,T,J,">Mab gives Harry advice about immortality ‘not being a replacement for being cautious’, implying he might become immortal if he awakens his true power

That's not implied at all. She just meant that there are lots of exceptions in the magical world. Immortals can't be killed... except on Halloween... or maybe with the help of special artifacts... Or in special places (Like the fairy battlefield)... And even if truly unkillable, they can still be knocked unconscious, or crippled, or imprisoned, or have their body destroyed and be forced to materialize again slowly somewhere safe. If Mab had been incapacitated in Chicago, sure, she would have recovered, but losing her for even a few hours would have lead to millions of deaths and a victory for team titan."

Weed is not physically addictive (can be psychologically addictive, though) and does much less damage to the (adult) body than alcohol does, but it's definitely still a drug. Getting behind the wheel high is as bad as driving drunk. It's also messy in that it's hard to measure whether someone smoked an hour back or a day back, so a test can't really tell if you're too high to drive right now or if that was yesterday.

19949,I,N,T,J,What about the fuckers on the ISS? Aren't most of them white? We have to shoot down the ISS before we blow up the planet.
19950,I,N,T,J,Bulbasaur is the best. Taught us all valuable lessons about how flashy looking stuff isn't always the best option in the long run.
19951,I,N,T,J,It was a very Harry thing to do.
19952,I,N,T,J,"No no, it's the stage I'm using, I'm not complaining. I was just trying to be funny."
19953,I,N,T,J,"3-8 is the land of milk and honey. I just got a level 3 Ester, a level 4 Ester, *and* another level 3 Ester as an Extra drop.

Now the haters will tell you I got nothing three times in a row before that, but you gotta have FAITH, people! RNGesus will reward you! The faithful will receive all the mats they need to E2 their favourite Operators, but those with doubt in their heart will be condemned to rock hell for all upcoming Contingency Contracts."
19954,I,N,T,J,"I heard another interesting theory on here the other week. We know Kravos' psychic attack did some real damage to Murphy's mind in Grave Peril. But it's possible it did the same thing to Rudolph. Only, unlike Murphy he didn't get any help from Harry in dealing with it.

We also know that Mirror Mirror is about how everything snowballs differently because Harry made one different decision in Grave Peril. I used to assume it was about not saving Susan at Bianca's party, but. *What if* the difference is Evil Harry saw Rudolph get attacked rather than Murphy, and helped him out and ended up becoming friends with him instead of Murphy. Remember - Murphy didn't really become a friend until after Grave Peril, it's perfectly plausible at that point for Harry to make a different cop friend.

This is very attractive for narrative reasons. If the different decision is not saving Susan we get no vampire war, no Maggie, no destruction of the Red Court, and probably no Ghost Story either. It's a completely different narrative, and Evil Harry has very little in common with our Harry. *However*, if Bianca's party plays out the same way and the difference is saving Rudy, the vampire plot line can remain intact up through Changes. However, with Rudolph instead of Murphy at his side, Harry might put an extra toe over the line morally speaking here and there. Maybe he is a little less concerned about mortal laws. Maybe he's less conflicted about killing near human opponents. Maybe he isn't as hard on Molly about never using black magic. Maybe he gives Lara's early offers of partnerships a second thought. And maybe, just maybe, he doesn't refuse to pick up Lasciel's coin at the end of White Night.

The end result is far more scary to our Harry than some evil wizard who had completely different adventures for 15 years. *This* Evil Harry would still be the father who would do *anything* to save Maggie. *This* Evil Harry would still be Molly's teacher, only now they wear matching black outfits and maybe Molly gets Thorned Namshiel's coin. *This* Evil Harry has Nicodemus Archleone and Rudolph for allies, and still flings Hellfire around rather than Soulfire. *This* Evil Harry may already be married to Lara, and has *not* been a good influence on her or Thomas. And *this* Evil Harry has two very annoying enemies in Chicago, in Michael and Murphy.

Man, I really hope this is what we get. Just imagine Michael, healthy and still a Knight, confronting (our) Harry and *begging* him to give up his coin, to help save Molly, to stop talking nonsense about alternate timelines because there is no undoing all the damage he has done."
19955,I,N,T,J,"Ah yes, the Prime Prion. In 2077 Earth's population had become unsustainable, and the world's elite, yada yada, big corporation something or other. But the prion was too strong, and humanity faced extinction. Enter teenage girl. Hot, but somehow bullied and outcast. Must save world. Complication, there is hot boy. Hot, but lonely. And he likes girl?? But wait. Other boy. Evil? Also likes girl?!?"
19956,I,N,T,J,I never liked industre anyway.
19957,I,N,T,J,"Well, he once said he likes computers, so really it should be free."
19958,I,N,T,J,"> Also i bet the next book Mirror, Mirror, which is about parallel univeres will incorporate time travel.

Jim has said there will only be one time travel book, and that it will be the final one before the BAT."
19959,I,N,T,J,"Their brains may have been developed enough for it, but the technology likely just wasn't there yet."
19960,I,N,T,J,I grew up once. Didn't care for it.
19961,I,N,T,J,"Also Mab is *definitely* dying. It'll look like it's because of some scary twist in the BAT, but it's actually because she did the horizontal tango with Harry in Changes."
19962,I,N,T,J,"Also I really like the character Molly, and think she has great chemistry with Harry. Plus she clearly does love him already."
19963,I,N,T,J,"Some beliefs are harmless. I'll never understand the Sikhs' insistence on always wearing the special turban, but it doesn't *harm* anyone for them to do so, so I'm not looking down on it any more than I look down on people who wear crosses and pray before eating. But not all beliefs are harmless. Whether you're a Christian looking to ban abortion and sabotage science education or you back female genital mutilation or you refuse to treat women as equals/shake their hand, congrats, you are now backwards trash, and society should actively defend itself from the poison you spread."
19964,I,N,T,J,I'd be very surprised if it's most.
19965,I,N,T,J,"I agree Harry isn't power hungry. But looking at the narrative, he keeps getting stronger, and there are probably a few more significant power ups coming his way, maybe artifacts as well. Similarly, he obviously doesn't want to actually rule a kingdom, but  if he creates a new white councilish thing it's definitely going to end up being something he will be forced to draw on like it's his personal army and he's its king, or at least the highest ranking general around. With the revelations in BG that the Warden can send prisoners out of the island under binding orders (a la evil genies rules lawyering those commands), he'll inevitable have to make use of those as well.

At best he'll become a Washington like figure who held massive authority for a while, then steps down voluntarily. But I suspect, given the power levels of some of the mantles that exist, that it's more likely it ends with him making some noble sacrifice and dying at the end of the BAT."
19966,I,N,T,J,"It was, but 25 is the latest word now I think, as of the Q&A after BG came out. Known future books include Mirror Mirror, a dragon book, and a time travel book. There should also be another Denarian themed one for book number 20."
19967,I,N,T,J,"Well, we are looking at 25 books + BAT, so that's roughly eight more years in-world before the BAT. Assuming the average of ~1 yeabetween books. Maggie should be in her late teens/early 20s by then. By YA standards, she gets to have a full life before losing her dad.

Also, honestly, the more powerful he gets, the more likely I think he either dies or loses all his powers at the end. I find it very unlikely the series ends with Harry alive and well with Odin levels of personal power, a kingdom of followers (Like it looks like he's going to build in the US, starting in Chicago), a prison full of dark gods and an infinity gauntlet's worth of random legendary artifacts. Best case scenario I think he gets to go back to being a mostly normal wizard."
19968,I,N,T,J,Ah. I can see how that would get old fast.
19969,I,N,T,J,"I mean, there's an Ignore Reports button that appears after the first report on any post. Dumbdumbs will report anything."
19970,I,N,T,J,This is why it's so important people marry as virgins. Nothing guarantees a healthy bedroom like a pristine knee length horse schlong coupled with a navel depth vagina.
19971,I,N,T,J,"It opens the door to some nasty complications. What if the person was temporarily depressed and could have been treated/would have recovered? We don't give out free guns to suicidally depressed people. We also shouldn't offer them other ways to die. Also, what if they were drugged? Or manipulated? What if they were blackmailed or threatened? Either you do this, or we'll hurt your family. What if they were bribed? Put on this mask and let us cut out your heart and we'll pay off your debt/pay your kids' college tuition. It would be very difficult to prove that no foul play was involved.

Hell, just imagine the human trafficking concerns. We'll bring your whole family into the country, buuut we're going to need to hang onto your first born, please sign here as their guardian. And you, kid, you sign too and we'll give you a lollipop. [Can you show me how to spell your name?](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ElectricCleanGlassfrog-size_restricted.gif) There we go.

But also, ultimately the most important issue is that human sacrifice doesn't do anything, just like every other dumb religious ritual. And letting people die for some ritual is just... gross. Any religion that tells you to do that should just be classified as a dangerous cult and stomped mercilessly."
19972,I,N,T,J,"I would not speak, except that I have been personally attacked."
19973,I,N,T,J,"Well, that's unfortunate.

Look, she cheated in a previous relationship, and she was sexting with an ex while with you, which is basically cheating as well. She was kind of a piece of shit. I wish you all the best in the future, but frankly you seem to deserve a lot better than her skanky ass."
19974,I,N,T,J,I don't think there are any laws against the president issuing pardons while he is in Moscow.
19975,I,N,T,J,I don't think there are any laws against the president issuing pardons while he is in Moscow.
19976,I,N,T,J,"Do we know what year Harry was born? Because it seems likely to me that Nicodemus was born ~1998 years before him, and that he is a Starborn from three cycles ago. 

If so, he's immune to N-fection. And it makes sense the Fallen would pick a leader of the Denarians who has that immunity, since Nemesis is one of very few forces that could subvert the Denarians."
19977,I,N,T,J,"Yeah, I'm not even a parent yet, but my relatives' little kids are all either good kids or little shits depending on how sticky and/or hyper they are at the moment. Most of the time they are fine... But when they aren't they are definitely little fuckers."
19978,I,N,T,J,"Downloads are more practical, but I like seeing my games sitting on a shelf. Also, hard drive space matters on consoles."
19979,I,N,T,J,"Man, I don't think I've even *seen* a PC that supported floppy discs in ten years. Not in meatspace, at least."
19980,I,N,T,J,">If something is understood by the majority of people then it's correct.

And now you are lying your ass off to pretend your original comment doesn't mean exactly what it says. What the heck is wrong with you? It's gross. You are being a dishonest, slimy asshole on purpose. I'm just going to block you now, because this is leading nowhere with you not having the integrity to admit you were wrong. But you know damn well your comment was idiotic."
19981,I,N,T,J,"> I never said 60% I said majority. The majority could be 97%

The majority is 50% +1. 60% was being generous. 97% is not what any honest person in the world means when they say majority. As for your professor, part of clear communication is knowing your audience. You should never find yourself communicating so poorly that the majority understanding you is even in question.

Just be clear and use correct grammar. The occasional mistake is fine, everyone makes them, but the ""As long as more than half understand"" mindset is repulsive and unfit for society."
19982,I,N,T,P,"I won't even dignify the social ""sciences"" as being actual science because they consistently fail the final steps of the scientific method: replication and reproducibility. It's just fun games with statistics. Certain things about them are useful as heuristics, and that's why I'm here."
19983,I,N,T,P,Less than damn.
19984,I,N,T,P,Either black or with half and half. Sometimes with cinnamon or nutmeg. No sugar. Always espresso.

19988,I,N,T,P,"I tried Dvorak once and hated it. I like QWERTY because it spaces letters far apart to prevent typing mistakes. I'm a touch typist. However, I can't tolerate most laptop keyboards because they're inconducive to anything other than hunt and peck."
19989,I,N,T,P,Gross. Any time I go there I have to get really specific with my order so it tastes like an espresso drink.
19990,I,N,T,P,Third grade I think.
19991,I,N,T,P,"It's in grave danger. And no, I don't think that freedom of speech should only apply to legal immunity from prosecution. You also should not be able to be censured by your employer or school for your opinions, no matter how socially distasteful, as long as you are not acting purposefully as a representative of the same. Consequences for one's speech should be strictly social."
19992,I,N,T,P,Uh yeah. Have you seen how much sugar syrup they put into their drinks? It's for basic bitches who pretend they like coffee but really just want expensive liquid dessert.
19993,I,N,T,P,You want rat strikes? Because that's how you get rat strikes.
19994,I,N,T,P,Dogs. They're already man's best friend.

19996,I,N,T,P,"I hate it when people call the current situation ""quarantine"". I'm not quarantined, and neither is anyone else where I live. I've been going to work every day as normal, just with a mask. However,  the funniest mask I saw had a middle finger on it."
19997,I,N,T,P,">for example, Taiwan, they hold empathy to a far higher standard and would actually consider people who aren't ""team players"" to be rather stupid, seeing those that are willing to work in teams collaboratively in far higher regard.  

Basically any country that values collectivism will be similar. By that standard I would be considered profoundly retarded because of how much I detest teamwork by default."
19998,I,N,T,P,You sure that you haven't any?
19999,I,N,T,P,Good. I have seen the term used entirely too broadly on this site.

20001,I,N,T,P,"Do you even know what a redneck is, or is that just a generic slur?"
20002,I,N,T,P,"I get that, but if you're on an American site it's a moderately safe assumption. Also, stupid opinions aren't just coming from Americans. There are some pretentious Europeans on this site that also need to get stuffed. Excluding people based on geography wouldn't solve the problem of idiots with a keyboard."
20003,I,N,T,P,People not talking about politics until next year.
20004,I,N,T,P,"It wouldn't cut down on the ignorant opinions here, so I'm indifferent."
20005,I,N,T,P,It pretty much only has a single element in common with the other Pokemon games: catching. It's too simplistic.
20006,I,N,T,P,"There are nonreligious universalists, or at least I think there are. Relativism seems to be the prevailing view among this site's userbase."
20007,I,N,T,P,Nope. I uninstalled it pretty quickly once I saw how one dimensional it was.
20008,I,N,T,P,"And also its opposite, moral universalism, which holds that goodness in the moral sense is independent of one's opinion on the matter."
20009,I,N,T,P,I just like unusual food. Always have.
20010,I,N,T,P,"That's one thing I like about my job: I'm never tied to the same place or the same task. My work is all local, but I get plenty of variety."
20011,I,N,T,P,">But their analysis isn't as unbiased as it may seem.  

This alone could have pages written about it. Despite being analytical types, we are not capable of being unbiased."
20012,I,N,T,P,"Haven't tried it (heard the horror stories), but I have eaten century eggs. Those also smell like ammonia from the protein decomposition, but in this case it's the lime they're cured in that does it."
20013,I,N,T,P,"Probably because they knew that calves drank milk like every other infant mammal, so it's very obviously food. It's just that some humans evolved to keep lactase production into adulthood,  and that coincides with people groups who raised lots of cattle."
20014,I,N,T,P,It's not bad if it's fixed well. Virtually no taste.
20015,I,N,T,P,"Lutefisk isn't bad tbh, but yeah it's amazing that anyone ever thought to try it."

20029,I,N,T,P,It's even more true now. People have an intrinsic human right to be armed that no valid government may abridge.
20030,I,N,T,P,Mentioning politics unprovoked. Wanting the other party to pay without asking.

20033,E,N,F,J,I feel like I tend to have the attitude of “you should only be justified in breaking the rules once you’ve proven you’re capable of following them”
20034,E,N,F,J,I wonder how long this meme of “intuitives think they’re master race but can’t even function in the real world” is going to last
20035,E,N,F,J,"Yeah that’s fair, I think I kind of do the same. I shouldn’t just jump to the conclusion that it loses some authenticity just because you’re uninhibited in that state."

20040,E,N,F,J,Well she’s kind of reaping what she sowed in terms of getting what you pay for

20048,E,N,F,J,Which is weird if you think about they all have introverted sensing which would make them the sensors

20050,E,N,F,J,"Honestly I kind of feel like this could be a metaphor for like having a freelance job vs a traditional 9 to 5 schedule. Like all my life the cool kids try really hard to convince everyone that the freelance life is a lot better not having to stick it to the man, meanwhile I always looked at them like ok have fun with the stress of constantly having to look for work and never knowing for sure if you’re going to be able to pay your bills on time."
20051,E,N,F,J,It’s beautiful because statistically most people get “INTJ” as a result regardless of what their actual type is

20060,E,N,F,J,The biggest regret i have in life is overlooking to agree to go out with someone who said they were an INTP/J
20061,E,N,F,J,"Honestly this is probably beside the point but I feel like ENTPs are at their best when they’re at their weirdest, but a lot of the time it seems like what they’re saying is just pushing some tired narrative that already exist but they put like a unique spin on it and then feel entitled to be regarded as a visionary when they’re just being pedantic"

20115,I,N,F,P,SAME my exact situation
20116,I,N,F,P,congratulations! :) i'm so happy for you
20117,I,N,F,P,i'm an infp and it's the same for me! i ALWAYS procrastinate and in the end i always regret it. sometimes i don't even reach my goal and i still can't stop!
20118,I,N,F,P,oh ok i'm an infp
20119,I,N,F,P,as an infp i relate lol
20120,I,N,F,P,i wanna come please! my favorite flowers are roses :)
20121,I,N,F,P,roses 💗
20122,I,N,F,P,donuts lol
20123,I,N,F,P,"i'm a female infp and i hate toxic masculinity. gosh why does this even exist. i'm so sorry this is happening to you, remember you are still worthy, even if some dumb people don't see that. it's their loss"
20124,I,N,F,P,omgg i haven't seen deena in such a long time! she was my fave in my very first animal crossing town
20125,I,N,F,P,god i am way too attached to this show
20126,I,N,F,P,"i think palermo is more vulnerable and while they share a lot of similarities, berlin is on another level. i love both of them extremely but they clearly have different approaches to things"
20127,I,N,F,P,seoul
20128,I,N,F,P,my thought exactly
20129,I,N,F,P,"i first thought about using him as my user flair (big contrast to mine, i'm aware of that) because my favorite characters usually fall in one of these two categories: they are similar to me (like stockholm and rio) or they have psychopathic characteristics (like palermo and berlin). i don't know why but i am often amazed by them because they are something i definitely am not. palermo also showed us a lot more vulnerability than berlin so i still feel a connection to him. he made mistakes but i think he learned from it. i know how it is to fall in love with your straight best friend and what pain that can cause. maybe i'm biased because i love his actor but he's definitely one of my favorite persons with a lot of potential"
20130,I,N,F,P,seems about right
20131,I,N,F,P,definitely me
20132,I,N,F,P,i pray for you and your family. nobody deserves this
20133,I,N,F,P,it looks gorgeous! do you have a dream adress? and is it hacked? :)
20134,I,N,F,P,thanks! i've had this town for half a year now with a break of around 2 months. yea it was pretty fast but in my old town i never completed the collection and i had had it for three years ;D
20135,I,N,F,P,"lmao am i the only one with amiibo cards? i bought like 200 cards of them and now i live in a town with all of my dreamies, including fauna. she's really lovely but my favorite is molly🦢"
20136,I,N,F,P,"Sure, that wasn't the point of my post. My mother and I have a very different taste in dog breeds so this is basically the only breed we both like besides Labradors and Bernese Mountain Dogs (which are too big)"
20137,I,N,F,P,"Thank you! And yes, I am from Germany and looking for a Golden Retriever, but Labradors are also great. I'll definitely check it out :)"
20138,I,N,F,P,"""you're a disgrace"" followed by ""it's your fault that you have mental illnesses, have you ever thought about me? i'm suffering by this, too. so just be happy again, it's not that hard"" and ""sexuality is a choice, you chose the wrong lifestyle"". yes, i do hate my biological parents and i'm grateful that i got adopted by two lovely and accepting people who i love more than anything"
20139,I,N,F,P,"i always had really good eyes, my family even called me an eagle. but around the age of 8, my eyes slowly got worse. i was still very young so I didn't know much about glasses, i thought only adults needed them. i noticed i couldn't watch tv anymore so i always sat right in front of the tv, yet didn't suspect anything. my mom said that i had to sit on the couch since sitting directly in front of the tv would make my eyesight really bad. little did we know.. 

the same thing in school, i enjoy sitting in the back of the classroom because shy and awkward and such things. one day in music class, i asked my friend what the heading was because i couldn't see the whiteboard anymore. she wrote the whole thing down for me and i was so grateful. 

one day i complained to this music teacher because she always wrote so tiny that i couldn't read it. she replied 'all of the other kids can read it. maybe you should tell your parents' and i did. my father also needs glasses so he understood and finally i realized that i needed glasses. everything made so much sense. the thing with the tv, that i couldn't read the license plates but my friends could, that the glasses of my friend actually worked for me etc.

we eventually made an appointment at the doctor's office and i got tested. turns out i had -3 at that point already which is pretty bad considering my age and that i still had no glasses. finally i got glasses (already nearly 11) and my life turned so much around. it's like watching a video on youtube in 240p and then changing to 1080p. i could finally see my face while washing it in the mirror again. even these little things made my life so much brighter and i'm so happy glasses exist.

now i'm at -8 diopters and diagnosed with an eye illness that makes my eyes go bad really fast like -1.5 diopters every year. i have to get new glasses regularly and it's really annoying but i'm still glad that i have access to them :)"

20217,I,N,F,P,"Yeah, but it would be better if OPPO let the users root their phone and do as they please. Instead they forbid users from unlocking the bootloader, hence locking the users to their platform.

20295,E,N,T,P,"Read Master and Margarita, it’s good"
20296,E,N,T,P,"That is **exactly** what always happens to me, too. Really don’t know how to overcome it tho"
20297,E,N,T,P," Me as an ENTP


Likes to watch fights he instigated…🙂…"
20298,E,N,T,P,"Ok, I’m in. Tho it’s not something I want to do, but something I have to do. I have to read a whole physics book which’s due in a month (was originally due in 3 months, but well). So, I’ll try to finish at least 1/4 of that book this week cuz well, it’s a challenge :P"
20299,E,N,T,P,"Ohhh same. I just can’t tell people I love them and really don’t know how to react when they say it. Also, when I’m reading something lovey and feel the emotions of the character, I always get a feeling that I’m kinda spied on and have an urge to stop feeling the emotion in a way"
20300,E,S,F,P,"I care about my appearance but it probably looks like I don’t care to other people because my style isn’t exactly what most girls would consider stylish. I mostly just wear unisex workout clothes all the time. I imagine if I had a healthy level of confidence, I wouldn’t care about my appearance, but since I don’t, I’m constantly thinking about my appearance and how to make myself look better because I don’t like the way I look now."
20301,E,S,F,P,"Honestly, my inner monologue is more of an outer monologue because I think out loud 99% of the time"
20302,E,S,F,P,I’m an ISTPish ESFP
20303,E,S,F,P,"I don't know that I've ever been played, but I do get made fun of for being optimistic or positive or happy, like I'm naïve or delusional or whatever, which isn’t true. I just have a naturally happy demeanor and smile a lot."
20304,E,S,F,P,My brother said and I agree that TV series’ have more room to be accurate and include more book stuff than movies who only have roughly 2 hours to work with
20305,E,S,F,P,"In my opinion, it's only bad when people take it too seriously or believe all the stereotypes. I personally just use it as a tool to better understand myself and just for fun, so I don't get too bogged down by it. I think the problem lies when people put too much emphasis on it."
20306,E,S,F,P,"I was mostly happy at the time, but when I think about it now, some messed up things did happen. Like one of my first memories is my older siblings (who were about 5 and 7) telling me when I was about 3 years old that everything bad that happened was my fault and that I had special powers that made bad things happen and they basically tried to convince 3-year old me that I was a supervillain. They also threw me down the stairs once that same year. I think at the time, I was optimistic and just wanted to hang out with them and, like many younger siblings, idolized them, but now it seems disturbing and they definitely didn’t treat me right. And it kind of feels like the first five years or so of my life, I was being hazed by them, until my sister finally accepted me as a friend and worthy of more than being a tiny punching bag."
20307,E,S,F,P,"I really only know INFPs and an INTP well enough to have an opinion. 

Based on the people I know, my opinion of INFPs is that they’re overall great people, but their constant complaining and negativity kind of weighs down on me after a while (but I annoy them with my talkativeness, so I guess it evens out). But they’re both kind and sweet and empathetic people who are loved by almost everyone they meet. And one of them is the person I most trust (and I don’t trust people often) because she is so nonjudgmental for the most part or at least when it matters. And she also understands and laughs at my self-deprecating humor whereas the other one hates self-deprecating humor (which is 95% of my comedy). They’re both way more skilled in comforting people than I am though. And they’re both great with and love kids and both have worked with children (one was formerly a daycare worker and now works as a patient care technician at the hospital (which is similar to a nurse, but with less responsibilities) and the other is currently a special ed student teacher for elementary school age children).

The INTP I know and I don’t really get along too well, but it’s not hostile. It’s more like we don’t have a lot in common so we just don’t interact that often. But he is incredibly smart and loves learning. He is very passionate about his interests (e.g. Star Wars). He’s not the best at showing or talking about emotion, but he’s incredibly empathetic and caring. He enjoys having conversations with people, but only if it’s a nonjudgmental, not argumentative atmosphere. There are a few things that he does that annoy me (and I’m sure I do plenty to annoy him). He does have a habit of talking over me when I’m speaking first and he also has a habit of thinking he’s right all the time even when someone has evidence that proves he is wrong (he tells them the evidence is wrong instead). He just tends to have more of a self-centered attitude. But overall, I do like him, he just annoys the hell out of me sometimes. And he is a proofreader, just because I told you the INFPs’ jobs."
20308,E,S,F,P,"I always exercise alone and I prefer exercising alone as it helps me clear my head and think. I actually spend a lot of time alone though and always have because I grew up in a family of introverts and didn’t want to bother them or annoy them, so got used to spending a lot of time alone, so I’m probably used to it by now. I do all sorts of things; solitary sports (like basketball, shooting hoops), watching TV or movies, watching YouTube videos, writing, occasionally reading, designing stuff, reorganizing my stuff or shifting my furniture around, playing video games, singing, and I’m almost always talking to myself no matter what I’m doing."
20309,E,S,F,P,"I’ve struggled with anxiety my entire life (like since I was a toddler) and I’ve struggled with either depression or depressive symptoms for about half of my life (since I was 11 or 12). I think for me a big part of it is, I don’t know if I would call it childhood trauma, but there were certain things that happened from when I was 8-12 that considerably lowered my self-esteem and I honestly don’t remember a time when I had a healthy amount of self-esteem. So I can definitely relate."
20310,E,S,F,P,You gotta love Rizzo
20311,E,S,F,P,"One of my first memories of singing was when I was about 9 or 10 and my older sister said that I wasn’t as good of a singer as I thought I was. And I didn’t really think I was that great, I just like to sing, but I guess I might overcompensate and come across as very confident. But now it’s 11, 12 years later and every time I sing, I think about those words. And then on the rare occasions where I actually feel good about my voice, I think maybe she was right; I’m not as good as I think I am."
20312,E,S,F,P,"I have an INTP brother and pretty much everything you said is true about us too. Though we’re 4 years apart with a sister (INFP) in between that we both get along really well with, so we never really needed to hang out with each other that much, except when we were little. It’s relatively civil now, but when we were kids, we really got on each other’s nerves daily. We’re different in a lot of ways but similar in the wrong ways (like we’re both incredibly stubborn). 

One thing I’ll add is I tend to trust my gut and follow my heart, so if someone is arguing with me about why I’m wrong using logic, it can feel like a personal attack because it involves my core morals/values and how I perceive something to be and it just feels like they’re insulting the basis of who I am and how I think, so that may explain why your sister responds that way, but I don’t know. For me, it would depend on what you’re discussing that would determine if I feel criticized by a logical argument. If I don’t get personally attached to my side, then I won’t be as defensive."
20313,E,S,F,P,"Oh yeah. From like 13-17 years old, I had career “goals” but they would change every 6 months to a year. Then, from 18 to now, I just have no idea. I’m definitely more of a “live in the moment” type of person and I absolutely hate thinking about the future and just wanna take it one day at a time, so I have no direction currently. Like I’m gonna be completing my associate’s degree next May (if all goes well) and I still have an undecided major. When I was 11, I remember I wanted to be a major league baseball player, which would probably still be the highest on my list if I weren’t a girl. Being a professional athlete is like the only career that always seems intriguing to me, and it’s of course one of the most unattainable careers (at least for the vast majority) there are."
20314,E,S,F,P,I’m an ESFP and I often type as an ISTP. A lot of tests aren’t really that accurate. I found that learning about each personality type and their functions was a more accurate way to type myself. Because I’m an enigma to literally anyone but myself. So I’m probably the only one that would be able to type me accurately.
20315,E,S,F,P,"I would say INxPs, just based on the people I know with those personality types. They’re all very pessimistic and “worst case scenario” thinkers."
20316,E,S,F,P,"I think one of the things that helped me (because these are the letters I struggled with the most) is Ns have a fantasy world and often daydream. Now I thought I had a fantasy world and had daydreams, but in actuality, my “fantasy world” was just a realistic fiction setting that would cause me unease if it wasn’t realistic and my daydreams were basically just offtopic thoughts I had (like “What does a bean mean?”) So those realizations are kind of what led me to see I was a sensor. I also grew up around a lot of INxPs so for a long time I thought I was an INFP, so it took a lot of self-exploration to find my actual personality type."
20317,E,S,F,P,"With me, you have to be loyal because I already have major trust issues (despite never being cheated on or anything). So if you actually do something to make me not trust you, there’s no second chance. Honestly, there’s barely a first chance, and if you fuck it up, bye."
20318,E,S,F,P,"I feel like mental illnesses in general can warp your personality, they may not change your basic functions, but they can change how you appear on the surface. I don’t know if that made sense at all. I’ll try to use me as an example. I am an ESFP, but over the years dealing with mental illnesses as well as an addiction, I test more and appear more as an xSTP even though my basic functions still line up with ESFP. So I don’t think you can change types completely, but your personality can morph, so much so that your personality can become unrecognizable to the people closest to you. But I don’t know."
20319,E,S,F,P,"I read that there are 3 different forms of perfectionism: self-oriented (high standards for self), other-oriented (high standards for others), and socially prescribed (high standards you think others have for you).

I would say for self-oriented perfectionism: xNxJs 

For other-oriented perfectionism: xxTJs

And for socially prescribed perfectionism:  xxFJs

But I would say, in general, Js are probably more likely to be perfectionists than Ps, though any type can fall into one or more of these forms of perfectionism."
20320,E,S,F,P,"I have an INTP brother, and I honestly can’t imagine speaking to him like that even if I was sick. I might complain about being sick a lot when I am sick, but I never treat people disrespectfully and act like they should cater to me, especially if that’s how you ask someone to do something for you. I don’t know. I just don’t think that’s a very nice way to treat people, especially when you want them to do something for you. I’m a big advocate for treating other people with respect, which includes when you’re sick."
20321,E,S,F,P,"I think one of the best things about my type is how optimistic and positive thinking I am naturally. Like growing up if something bad happened to me (not like really bad, but like if I had a really bad day or experience), like an hour later or the next day, I’d have already moved on. And I don’t really see that a lot in the rest of my family, they get dragged down very easily, and that’s sad to me. I was always like the smiley, happy kid because I just moved on from things that maybe didn’t go my way.

Of course, I am depressed now, so maybe pushing down feelings is not the best coping mechanism lmao"
20322,E,S,F,P,"Okay. I have very strong political opinions that are very liberal. However, I don’t get into talking politics often because it just gets me pissed off and for the most part, arguing with someone who doesn’t agree with you (at least about politics) is pointless and neither of you are gonna change their mind. And I don’t enjoy arguing for arguing sake. Though, if someone is acting like any group of people is less than any other group of people, that will trigger me. I have very little patience for people treating other people badly because of some superiority complex."
20323,E,S,F,P,"I had the most trouble figuring out if I was N or S. Probably because I grew up with and spent a lot of time playing made up games with my older intuitive siblings. And I do have a big imagination, so I assumed I was intuitive for a long time. But I guess the main thing I’ve found that differentiates me from my siblings is basically how our imaginations work, I guess. They’re both very into fantasy and can create fantasy things very easily. I, on the other hand, cannot to save my life. Everything I imagine has to be realistic and it can be very frustrating and I have to remind myself that it doesn’t matter if it’s realistic because I will literally stress myself out trying to write something realistically instead of just letting creativity flow. This could just be my family though. I don’t know if it’s necessarily because of those letters, but that’s what it feels like to me."
20324,E,S,F,P,"Coming from me, yes. I make everything weird."
20325,E,S,F,P,Said something mean behind my friend’s back. Ultimate way to kill my interest in you. Don’t be a dick.
20326,E,S,F,P,"I’m naturally right handed, but I’m teaching myself to be ambidextrous just because I’m bored"
20327,E,S,F,P,"I’m not great at that, it makes me feel awkward. I’m definitely more of a do things for you/with you type of person. For example, I’ll 100% without a doubt drink with someone who’s sad or whatever, but I think I really suck at building someone up with words. I don’t think it ever really sounds genuine coming out of my mouth or it feels forced when someone tells me they’re sad and it’s obvious I’m just saying nice things about them to make them feel better, as it feels to me when people do that to me. I would much rather just go somewhere and get their mind off of it by having fun."
20328,E,S,F,P,"I don’t know if I’ve ever actually been called a free spirit, but I am"
20329,E,S,F,P,"I mean, to be honest, I talk a lot and my filter is relatively thin, but I’m also an empath, so before I say something, especially about somebody else, I think about how it will be perceived by them. Because I’m also really sensitive, so I try to be sensitive to what other people may be insecure about already. I don’t want to say something intended as a joke and have it really hurt them, because that is something that has happened to me before and it doesn’t feel great, so I try really hard not to do that to other people."
20330,E,S,F,P,"My high school teacher offered free voice lessons, I think mainly for people in the advanced groups, but I never took them."
20331,E,S,F,P,Don’t push your emotions down because they’re too depressing. It’s just gonna cause you more problems later when you’re an adult and nobody cares about your emotions anymore.
20332,E,S,F,P,I don’t think people realize that everyone is some version of an ambivert. No one is a full introvert or extrovert.
20333,E,S,F,P,Pretty accurate for me. I don’t think people realize that my insanity is just to entertain people.
20334,E,S,F,P,Words of affirmation and then gifts. Physical touch is last for me. I think I tend to show love by acts of service though.
20335,E,S,F,P,"I can relate. Typically, if I were to take the test during an anxiety attack, I’d get ISFP and during a depressive episode, ISTP. I tend to react to mental health issues by withdrawing and essentially turning into an introvert."
20336,E,S,F,P,I talk quietly but so much and all the time lmao
20337,E,S,F,P,"I have anxiety, so most of my problems are not actual problems, I just perceive them to be problems. So the first thing I do is ignore it and see if it goes away on its own (which it usually does). But if it’s an actual problem and doesn’t go away, (I can’t think of a real example right now) I usually just think something along the lines of “Has something like this happened before? What happened that time? So what did I do that time? Did it work?” etc. And if it hasn’t happened to me before, I consult Google."
20338,E,S,F,P,"Speaking for my INTP brother, just no"
20339,E,S,F,P,I tend to have crushes on either ISxP guys or ExFJ guys
20340,E,S,F,P,"I cross dress everyday lmao
But yeah, I like dressing up."
20341,E,S,F,P,This is honestly the only way I do schoolwork lmao
20342,E,S,F,P,Yes. I love helping people out. I personally would do it way more often than I do right now if I didn’t have social anxiety.
20343,E,S,F,P,"I don’t think I really change interests a lot. I’ve had pretty much the same interests since I was a teenager or so. I mean, I’ll add interests as they come to me, but my core interests stay pretty consistent."
20344,E,S,F,P,I got ESFJ and that would’ve probably been my guess
20345,E,S,F,P,I talk to myself because it helps me think. It’s hard to separate my different thoughts if they remain inside my head.
20346,E,S,F,P,"I’m 21 years old and currently still in college with an undecided major. Every few weeks, my INFP mother asks me what I wanna do with my life and I always hit her back with a “I dunno”. She wants a real answer, but I just take things day by day. I hate thinking about the future if it’s more than one day ahead. I am trying to have a daily schedule for the first time since high school, so maybe that’s a step in the right direction."
20347,E,S,F,P,"https://i.imgur.com/z7MppAY.jpg 

Oh and I’m a girl by the way if you were wondering"
20348,E,S,F,P,"I used to babysit my cousin’s kid before quarantine went down, and I honestly didn’t change how much I swore around him. I mean, he was gonna hear it anyway, knowing his dad."
20349,E,S,F,P,"Simple Plan, He is We, and Avril Lavigne 

I would say I generally prefer pop punk, but honestly any genre of pop (indie-pop, pop rock, etc) I tend to like. I definitely focus more on lyrics though."

20353,I,N,T,P,">And even among life sims, I think something like The Sims offers a lot more variety in terms of the sort of choices you can make and whatnot. I feel like Animal Crossing isn't quite as free form in that sense. You're probably not gonna have zany, unique experiences or anything. It's more rigid in that sense.

- it does get a little better, probably a lot better when you finally strike out on your own
- stay in touch with people
- invest in your future; it can be money, plans, research, etc, dont go in unawares
- make a resumé 
- if you want to text them first just go ahead bc they're not gonna criticize you to your face
- do not lose your sense of wonder; always appreciate the birds, the clouds, the plants you see, the sunrises and sunsets
- ask your teachers for help bc if they do help you that's good and if they don't you can complain about them to your friends
- other random stuff old people will tell you"

20450,E,S,F,J,"Thank you for your reply! How would I use Ti yo form an identity? Like what’s an example? I question my identity all the time already, but mainly cause I’m spending way too much alone time as an ESFJ. Should I always be showing my Ti identity when Fe is so strong?"
20451,E,S,F,J,"Thank you very much for your reply! I currently spend a lot of time alone for certain reasons but I don’t have motivation to do anything really. Not like the 2 motivation I have. I guess I think, but which thinking center would I go to if I don’t have any arrows naturally towards them?"
20452,E,S,F,J,But twos don’t have an arrow to the head type right? How would we do that then?
20453,E,S,F,J,I you love too!
20454,E,S,F,J,Now you have to maintain it every time you see them
20455,E,S,F,J,How can I make it to where I like using Fi/Se? I’d like to love myself more and also be passionate at something. Fe seems to just get taken advantage of by people.
20456,E,S,F,J,Yay friends!!!
20457,E,S,F,J,Happens to me as well
20458,E,S,F,J,Sounds like an ESFJ to me. Sounds just like the stereotype too sheesh...
20459,E,S,F,J,A lot of people disagreeing but it got a whole bunch of upvotes which is odd. Also as a 2 I feel I did this growing up. Maybe I was on my 3 wing or grew to a 4 like personality for a while.
20460,E,S,F,J,If I like someone and their Fi cares then I care? I’m having a hard time figuring my own feelings and I’m starting to think that it’s because I am others feelings. They come when I connect with someone and if they care I care. What do you guys think?
20461,E,S,F,J,I have yet to understand when I use any functions that aren’t in my ego. I see this all the time posted and still have yet to understand it. Or maybe I am just expecting to enjoy them or be good at them? Well then that’s a different story.
20462,E,S,F,J,This is true honestly for me. I don’t know how to separate or don’t want to? How do I access Fi? Or does it matter since it isn’t of value to me and would be unhealthy since it’s not in my stack?
20463,E,S,F,J,I thought Fi was empathy?
20464,E,S,F,J,I heard from somewhere you’re supposed to go towards like a growth direction so I would be a 4. I do feel strong 1 convictions I guess about being good which is so drained of especially during Covid. But am I still a 2 or a 1 now? Or supposed to go to a 4?
20465,E,S,F,J,Yeah when I’m alone there is always like eyes on me. Maybe like spiritual or god thing but I never actually feel like I’m a not judged or something alone so it always makes it hard for me to remove the judgement and do something confidently. And I’m not totally following what you mean about hanging out with the high but I don’t really smoke so maybe that’s why. I’m an esfj myself.
20466,E,S,F,J,I can appreciate that
20467,E,S,F,J,I agree with this
20468,E,S,F,J,How do you separate from Fe even by yourself? I feel like Fe is always there even alone. It’s like I never feel alone. Also what is your mbti our of curiosity?
20469,E,S,F,J,What’s the point?
20470,E,S,F,J,"Can I asked what your needs are exactly? Most people say that but don’t specify. Maybe I do know mine and can relate. Like basic needs like water, sleep, sex, etc? And what desires do you have? Like passions? I have none. It feels more natural just to be apart of someone else’s and I don’t see the point in having my own at that point if there’s no motivation for it."
20471,E,S,F,J,"So how do you separate and am I supposed to if I’m naturally a 2? If I’m motivated for one thing and not the other, how could I ever find my own feelings since I have no desire to? This is what confuses me about enneagram and I’m still trying to understand my own feelings. Can anyone actually offer a solution and not just instructions about a theory of how?"
20472,E,S,F,J,So a 6 is an anxious 9? Or is a 9 a calm 6? I’ve said this plenty of times as a 2.
20473,E,S,F,J,"That was honestly one of the more well thought out responses I’ve seen so far. Seriously and I really appreciate that. Actually seeing two examples of the same side by side helps so much more than just explanations. 

At the end there you said we use both. So like what would happen if there was an argument at the group gathering and also the nephew alone on the couch at the same time?? Silly question possibly but would that mean I would still focus on the group and you still the nephew? Do you focus at all on group harmony? Or like is that example showing that if we were both there then we would prioritize two different things? Also I’m curious about identity. Does Fe take on someone else’s identity and Fi come from like within (like innate soul kind of thing)?

Edit: I shouldn’t say someone else’s identity but more like a group identity kind of thing. Would also keep the harmony I would assume?"
20474,E,S,F,J,What’s the difference?
20475,E,S,F,J,"
I would love to hear your thoughts on things honestly. I don’t know any ISFPs except an ex but I didn’t know at the time. One hobby of mine I guess is picking others brains. That’s the closet thing to what I like as I can get lol. The thing though about what I want is like what are wants exactly? I know that sounds silly but people on here have been very vague about all this stuff and I need specifics. Thank you for the kind words too btw."
20476,E,S,F,J,"I don’t play Minecraft so this might not be things you can do but people, family photos, list of chores, kids art on a fridge, box of memories, to do list half checked off...that’s all the stereotypes I can think of currently :)"
20477,E,S,F,J,Hey I just saw this yesterday too!! It’s very informative but I still don’t understand one thing. Is me Fi or Ti? If it’s Fi then it’s not valued like ever. If it’s Ti then it’s doesn’t seem like it’s still like a me but more of an opinion and also draining to get too and build. Does that make sense? Ti isn’t a like though so it still confuses me about where Fi would play out in a healthy manner if it only comes out during stress and not valued in my day to day decisions. I also just can’t value you it at will right since it’s not part of my natural normal stack?
20478,E,S,F,J,"You don’t live by them though right? They are basically just there, but not valued? So you get no feel goods from using them so basically they seem pointless to you? Just wondering. Been thinking about them a lot cause I feel all Fe always and never use Fi since it always is in conflict with me Fe."
20479,E,S,F,J,I don’t know if it’s Ti or something but I can always find a reason for it to be okay not to express and that I’m actually wrong about my judgement or something and instead like it changes my feelings about them. That part makes me more mad because people don’t do that for me but I can’t help it. So basically I can’t become sooo “understanding” to where I don’t see the point in my own feelings or something and that mine are always invalid. Extreme people pleasing maybe? I can’t separate when I can be mad or not like someone and when not. It always somehow turns to being okay with everyone but then on  my for them to like that I do that? So it feels fake too at times so I get why Fe would be coined as fake. I don’t know what my true feelings are it seems ever or if they ever seem to matter to me. I’m obviously really confused....
20480,E,S,F,J,"I appreciate it! I am curious though, a lot of times on reddit I just hear a lot of validation but not like any kind of examples or proof of things which I feel like I need to really believe (probably Si?). Is there any examples you can provide of this or like a way to show this is the case? I apologize if I’m slow or that’s a bad question, my brain just needs some type of way of knowing this is true."
20481,E,S,F,J,My best friend is an INTJ. He’s cool as shit.
20482,E,S,F,J,Wait so do I have my own feelings? Or are they others? As an Fe dom?
20483,E,S,F,J,I know it’s not identical but still thought it was interesting. My sis and bro are fraternal twins and she’s an ISFJ and he’s an ESFP. So they are each other’s shadow.
20484,E,S,F,J,"I have this problem. I’m also trans I think (another identity crisis). I don’t know if having Fe and Si, is like absorbing social norms and absorbing others identities? I don’t know honestly. Am I just very feminine and gay? It took me til I was 24 to come out to myself. Is that because of my inferior Ti? Shit sucks man. Open to opinions. Is identity an Fi thing? I don’t have it in my stack nor do I use it but it’s so weird to me that I wouldn’t have my own innate identity. Like I thought that was fundamental to every human? Does Fe just keep rewriting it? Shit makes my head spin. Hopefully I don’t to anyone else’s and I’m just overthinking (stuck in a Ti grip maybe?)"
20485,E,S,F,J,I love it.
20486,E,S,F,J,Golden pairs homie. Cs Joseph’s talks all about it.
20487,E,S,F,J,Can anyone explain why the 2s don’t have arrows to the thinking group? Why is that? Also this is beautiful.
20488,E,S,F,J,Sigh....yes.
20489,E,S,F,J,Happens to me as a 2 as well
20490,E,S,F,J,"Introverted sensing.

Edit: Extraverted feeling as first, introverted sensing as second."
20491,E,S,F,J,May I ask what type you are?
20492,E,S,F,J,How has your journey been?
20493,E,S,F,J,"But let my mind explore possibilities for what? And what am I supposed to be imagining? And so when you say build then does that mean like there isn’t something there naturally and I’m supposed to pick and choose to be like something? Anytime I dive deep, I don’t ever see a me. I don’t feel like a me. I don’t understand it honesty. But sure I’ll check that out thank you!"
20494,E,S,F,J,"It feels like to me that being extraverted, you are literally one with the outside environment and it is the part of yourself that you experience most comfort with being that it’s your top function. It makes sense to me how it can overwrite any functions under it. I’ve noticed it over and over again everyday it never seems to sustain. It’s like I have to workout mentally for it but then it goes away again. I don’t understand why it can’t feel permanent every time. Like working out. You can sustain the muscles unless you do it everyday and there’s so much chaos sometimes in life that it’s hard to set that time aside. I am no psychologist or expert on this though it just I have experienced this shit and it fucks with my head. I try to remain positive to like you say but that doesn’t always actually fix it. I need a fix. Something that actually does it. Maybe an infp would be the better way to go for you? Maybe it’s not even the extraverted or introverted function. I really don’t understand myself. Maybe it’s the roles in the relationship that do it. The dominant person kind of holds and the other mends to them. Like a trade off of power. Even if it’s subconscious and not even intended. Not to get stereotypical gender roles or anything but just in general having someone lead and the other follow? Or can’t have two leading right? There will be conflict. Two following would result in not being able to make decisions. Idk honestly that compete I’m getting at or if it makes total sense but kind of thinking out loud here. I look on the internet and along with all other mental disorders, there is no cure which is starting to speak to me those things don’t ever change. I would love to hear one person be “cured”."
20495,E,S,F,J, Man that hit deep and made me sad. I really hope that you guys can get back together. Never had a soulmate but that sounds amazing. Do you think 4s and 2s are closer to that than being paired with other types because then that’s what I will look for. Also yeah I could see how a sense of self would be such an issue. So far I haven’t seen any real help for it other than just treatment. More of like a cross to carry then something that can be tamed. Hopefully I’m wrong though. I’d be happy to hear if she gets better or not and wish you the best of luck.
20496,E,S,F,J,"If it’s not innately then where does it come from and then it could be changed right?

And yes I can have strong variants but that will always be primary? Everything else would be a runner up or following behind it? And I’m just asking questions and figured you would know some things. I apologize if it came off aggressive. If someone seems like they know what they are talking about, I like being able to ask them questions as it’s easier than searching the internet and getting my specific ones answered."
20497,E,S,F,J,Why did you guys split if I can ask? And yeah so far nothing has helped. I’ve almost accepted that I’m just not supposed to have one and I’m supposed to be molded. Why would it have to be work and be so easily thrown away if that weren’t true?
20498,E,S,F,J,So like that’s just who I am innately is this sx 2? My sole desire is that paragraph? What for? Like what can’t I have multiple focuses? Talk about no free will goodness.
20499,E,S,F,J,"I’m a 2 and I just don’t have a self. If I build one, eventually it just fades in a relationship. I had to build a self growing up and didn’t realize it and then it just all gets erased if I were to get into a relationship which is like my motivation in life innately. Or to be loved. I just mold into whatever my SO would want or what would keep the relationship going. Zero natural desire for myself. So strange honestly. Like I’m alive and a human, why am I designed for other people? Why don’t I have like a me? Any other 2s relate or is it just me? Hopefully it’s just me but it’s been bugging me."

We argue like lawyers. But at the end of it all, he is the first one to put his pride aside (despite his leo moon) and help us get to a fair bottom line."
20656,E,N,F,P,cute!
20657,E,N,F,P,"yeah, if you connect the dots 😂"
20658,E,N,F,P,😆 Yeah it is haha
20659,E,N,F,P,I laughed way too fucking hard!
20660,E,N,F,P,"I’m talking about the transit not the natal placement. We are currently coming to the end of Pisces in Neptune, It has been in that sign for the last 7 yrs and it will enter Aries in 2026."
20661,E,N,F,P,"Welp, It’s a good thing that Neptune in Pisces has shown a light on mental health and we have more access to professional and effective self help now more than ever before. Fuck curses."
20662,E,N,F,P,"Yes, My leo rising wants compliments pumped into me like an IV. But my capricorn stellium and virgo sun make it really difficult to take them without some type of self deprecating joke."
20663,E,N,F,P,This is 100 percent virgo lol
20664,E,N,F,P,"Scorpio Venus, 4H. I have an avoidant attachment style I’m doing my best to work through. All of my relationship have been on/off. I like how this goes past the jealous possessive stereotype of ViS. I have NEVER been that type of person. Instead I draw men who are like that. And they always have venus in leo/leo moon. I am obsessive when it comes to something I am deeply interested in like astrology, decorating my home and planning out capsule wardrobes."
20665,E,N,F,P,Did you listen to the newest episode with her friend lauren? Alex needs someone close to her to bounce off of. They were really funny together. First episode Ive liked since Sofia left.
20666,E,N,F,P,Just discussed this in my CNA class for the mental health chapter. Apparently completed suicide is the acceptable way to say it in a professional or formal setting. They have always tried to be politically correct and receive a lot of criticism when they discuss certain topics. This is just an attempt at not offending anyone.
20667,E,N,F,P,Leo rising. People think Im outgoing and friendly. But Im  socially  awkward and clumsy. I blame my leo asc square scopio venus aspect.
20668,E,N,F,P,"Whenever I’ve felt the urge to leave a relationship it was because I felt like I wasn’t being true to myself. 

I wasn’t ready to be in a serious relationship when I first started dating at 16. But all the guys I attracted wanted that. They were emotionally immature but responsible and faithful. I loved to be loved so much I never set standards for myself or even took the time to figure out what I wanted and needed as an individual.

Eventually I would feel trapped and resentment would set in. All my relationships have had the same on/off quality to them because they would beg me to stay no matter what I did. Then I would feel so conflicted and guilty for abandoning them. 

Ive read countless relationship books and advice about leaving a toxic relationship. But they always paint one side more at fault than the other(usually the man).

While I do know that is the case in many situations. I believe that much of my own behavior in my relationships has been just as toxic. 

Leaving has always been based on wanting to stop causing emotional harm to myself and my partner."
20669,E,N,F,P,“I thought you liked me.” 😂😂😂
20670,E,N,F,P,This is eerily true
20671,E,N,F,P,*Laughs in poor person*
20672,E,N,F,P,Who doesnt want nurturing partner who accepts them? I could say I want everything on this list.
20673,E,N,F,P,I feel the same. As a virgo with scorpio venus and 7th house Aqua North Node. Don’t try to control me or Im gone.
20674,E,N,F,P,I feel you! I have a cry baby moon with a drama queen rising. I cry for every emotion.
20675,E,N,F,P,Exactly sometimes silence is louder than words.
20676,E,N,F,P,I want to do this. Its the only way I can actually get what I want for my birthday. 😆
20677,E,N,F,P,True. It is hard to believe there are still people who still dont know what vegan means. I worked with a girl who claimed to be a vegan and was very outspoken about it. She would ask the cook what her food was cooked in and even refused to eat the fries because they were cooked in the same oil as the fried chicken. Then I’d see her eating the cinnamon rolls and donuts from the coffee shop at least once or twice a week. I also had to explain to her that if her kids still eat chicken and fish they are not vegetarians. 🤦🏽‍♀️
20678,E,N,F,P,It blows my mind that acknowledgment of the problem with zero intent to fix it got 149 up votes. All he had to say was “not vegan”
20679,E,N,F,P,Depends on the situation. Some people aren’t worth the energy. I’ve learned there is a such thing as unfixable stupidity.
20680,E,N,F,P,"You’re not leading me anywhere, dude.
And I’m not following."
20681,E,N,F,P,"I was joking. I have never had the will or the need to force anyone to stay. What you’re saying here seems like  you took my joke seriously and you believe I am actually having trouble forming relationships because Im too self absorbed and expect everyone to love and accept me. Which is funny, because all the things you have worded to say I should be or am not doing are exactly who I am as a person, my chosen profession and life path."
20682,E,N,F,P,Thats some 8th house shit.
20683,E,N,F,P,"Virgo sun, Cancer Moon, Leo rising"

20692,E,N,F,P,"Hell no! I hate clingers! Sure, in the beginning I like to spend a lot of time together but I need my space and with clingy, comes insecurity when I need that space. I have a cancer moon/scorpio venus I married a leo moon/leo venus. Ive never known someone to cling so hard and get upset when I needed me time."
20693,E,N,F,P,I can get anyone to stick around with the right amount of rope.
20694,E,N,F,P,I don’t read too far into it anymore. Everyone is fighting their own inner battles. I get shy sometimes. Maybe in those moments Im projecting.

20698,E,N,F,P,"Yup! I am a virgo! Im also extremely into astrology, fucking with charts and shit. Its so interesting to read these comments all describing my Leo rising sign."
20699,E,N,F,P,"That makes sense. Ive been coming into my own more in the last couple of years. But for as long as I can remember, Ive minimized myself to make other people feel more comfortable. I still enjoy making others feel accepted, but Ive developed a low tolerance for BS lately. Ive always had that part of me in there. Maybe other people could see it before I could."

That's a lot of goddamn really sweet fruit.  But it comes with 13 grams of fiber, and lots of other good stuff, potassium. Magnesium, iron, calcium, vitamin c etc...

I could probably eat a whole pineapple but I'd be pretty satisfied after.  Someone else mentioned that a bottle of mtn dew (I'm assuming 20 oz) is 71 grams of sugar, so about a pineapples worth of sugar.  In no way will I be satisfied after that."

Poor girl was so scared to let her family know. I told my dad and he asked his friends who were detective, journalist, and cops to set up a bait. He took that bait and got caught by the time he was about to unbutton my poor friend's shirt in a motel. We made sure his career was over and it was. The guy suffered in shame because it was all over the news. I don't feel bad about it."

20754,I,N,T,J,"Nah I like long replies where we can explain things in depth :)

So, from my understanding, your point is you're all for going deeper but you don't trust people to have a capability of getting lost into the unknown and get themselves out of it? 

If you knew what's behind all that unknown, then they wouldn't be scary anymore would they? Acceptance is a good thing but shouldn't we need to know what are we accepting? I break things apart, categorize parts to learn all about them from the inside then I put them back together again. It helps my understanding. By doing that doesn't mean I accept or reject them.

Each person has their own way but for myself, I can use my senses as tools to learn about the tangible reality of myself and the world then I dig deep inside my subconscious through manipulating my dreams and meditation to explore subconscious. 

We are products of our environment. The shadow is unknown and they vary through each situation. We wouldn't know our shadow if we don't have anything to reflect upon. This is why I think the external world is part of our identity. 

Some people identify themselves with the image they see in the mirror; they don't like the way they look and don't feel good about it, can I say it's not their identity? No. It's their own subjective view, who am I to say? One thing I know for sure is that when people say they got it all figure out, we all know that's not true. 

At the end of the day, it all boils down to how and where you grew up, which school of thoughts you adopted. Nature vs nurture. 

I'm glad that we both agree awareness and acceptance aren't the same but they come together. Just like external and internal. Perceiving then judging. From details to abstract. Micro and macro. It's the nuance in between that we can feel comfortable to call it ""sense"" of self and identity."

20757,I,N,T,J,"I like your answer. You got a point there. About going deeper, don't you think we can find something there? It's like they say the deeper the root go, the higher the tree grows. And how does going deeper would make it not communicating with my shadow? For me personally, the scarier it is, the more I need to go there. It's not always an ugly or pretty sight but at least I bring that dark corner into light. Don't you think acceptance and awareness are two different things?"
20758,I,N,T,J,We need to slow down testing. I don't kid.
20759,I,N,T,J,"It's understandable since 4 and 5 has the biggest gap in enneagram wheel. I hope you don't feel too alone in this world. I think you can be contradictory but as long as you accept both sides, you'd feel whole with yourself. I like this quote a lot ""Nothing happens in contradiction to nature, only in contradiction to what we know of it""."
20760,I,N,T,J,"So, what if I ask you how did get your sense of identity? And how can you help people who don't know what a sense of identity is to attain some?"
20761,I,N,T,J,"I do and I don't. I think we're social animals so we mirror, we reflect and we project constantly. Our awareness will be ever shifting. I've gone through 2 times of egocide in the last 10 years and I've realized that the ultimate identity is no identity. Unlearning is the ultimate learning. I think MBTI or psychology is just a tool for categorization - nothing more, nothing less. I enjoy MBTI stereotypes, however. I think it's entertaining."

20773,I,N,T,J,"INTPs can get self-anxious when it comes to dating. Don't forget their tendency to overthink everything so his online interaction style sounds about right. If INTPs banter with you it's a sure sign they like you. You need to initiate all interaction though, they're not really initiative. From my experience, I think he does like you. However, they tend to be insensitive so make sure to keep your boundary and let him know when he's being insensitive. That'd help both of you and he'd appreciate that. Good luck!"

20804,E,N,T,P,"I mean, that's why I said it was a half crackpot theory, but it lead to a very important theory. Eventually I'll make a followup post which will go over the three potential theories that your comment detailed :)"

20807,E,N,T,P,"My god, I didn't expect to see this. This isn't secretly run by Asslo, is it?"
20808,E,N,T,P,"No problem. I absolutely loved CS4, and part of Hajimari, though it did take some time to get used to how much it feels like another Cold Steel entry while being vastly unique."
20809,E,N,T,P,"My one character is Tex, the Meta, and Carolina all in one"
20810,E,N,T,P,"No, both were amazing and made me feel really emotional. The way the story moved in Hajimari feels... Not dissimilar to CS4"
20811,E,N,T,P,"I mean, you know they have to. It wouldn't be right if they didn't. 

Another thing to note is just how overwhelmingly powerful blue team is.

Sheila, Tex, Caboose, and Tucker are all VERY good whenever they focus.

Church can even infect lopez and take out red team from behind, so I think this will be a pretty hardcore victory."
20812,E,N,T,P,"I imagine if church goes down, caboose gets bloodlusted.

Tucker has shown to be the most competent of fighters of the group, with washington, carolina, and church all supporting his new role of leadership and even going so far as to personally train him.

Blue team looks to be the probable winner here, judging by the data we have, but we'll have to find out soon

Edit: just realized this was about Yang vs Caboose. I do have the stupid"
20813,E,N,T,P,Even after 15 years I still haven't beaten Golden Sun 2 yet. I never got past the point where I needed the three orbs to get past the wall

Jeremy, Michael, Alfredo, Matt, and I think Jack each do independent streaming, sometimes Lindsay might. I don't know about Fiona or Trevor streams, haven't seen any of theirs if they do."

20823,E,N,T,P,"After a couple additional months of testing, I've moved forward to Divine Knight Combat, which in and of itself in incredibly detailed. 

Arts and Crafts were VERY difficult to test, especially with all the buffs, debuffs, and delay stats that can exist in one turn.

20850,E,N,F,P,"Haha I’m similar to you. Tried to ignore the Dorne plot, Arya’s implausible stabbing. Was disappointed in Battle of the Bastards. 

Everyone was hyped asf for The Long Night, but the second Arya killed the night king I was like WHAT IN THE FLYING FUCK ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!!!!"
20851,E,N,F,P,"Bringing Benjen back just to have him die in 5 seconds...goddamn that was horrible writing...

I also had given up by end of season 7 and was almost secretly hoping season 8 but at least be a teensy bit better—I’d be told the production team had been split in half for the last two seasons, and all the good writers and directors were on Season 8. 

Boy was I wrong. Season 8 was unimaginably worse. But by then I had already stopped caring."
20852,E,N,F,P,"Seriously, Varys did that? I think by that time we were already so deep in D&D bullshit, it all feels like a wash to me."
20853,E,N,F,P,"Well there’s also the fact that sometimes even crazy auteurs don’t know what they’re doing haha. I thought Season 1 of Westworld was godlike. And I just can’t wrap my mind around the fact that the same people who wrote that season also wrote seasons 2 and 3....especially season 3. 

So in my mind it’s not that the writers aren’t talented. It’s that’s they’re not given enough time to properly develop their work."
20854,E,N,F,P,A girl has insane cloning skills.
20855,E,N,F,P,Hahah goddamnit
20856,E,N,F,P,"My blood still BOILS when I think about how they did Littlefinger dirty. And that horrifically stupid side plot of Sansa and Arya quarreling just to mislead Littlefinger. As if he’d be so stupid to fall for their tricks, and to not defend himself when faced with their accusations. 

Littlefinger is one of the most important players of the Game of Thrones, and is possibly the one who set all the events of ASoIaF in motion. In my mind he was supposed to make it to end game, actually ends up sitting on the throne. Until Sansa takes him down."
20857,E,N,F,P,The way they just gracelessly killed off Ser Barristan like he wasn’t integral to the plot and Dany’s character arc...that for me was the beginning of the end...
20858,E,N,F,P,"Good call. I kept wondering when they were gonna bring back Nymeria and tie it all in to the larger narrative. When Nymeria came back in Season 7, I got excited because I thought it was finally happening.

By the end of Season 7, I realized what you did....that bringing Nymeria back was just to tie up a loose end, which really tied up nothing. They may as well have not even brought her back with the mountain of loose ends that were left when Season 8 finished. Just..whyyyyy????"
20859,E,N,F,P,"LMFAOOOO that scene when Bronn randomly as fuck just walks in on Tyrion and Jamie, threatens them with a crossbow, and then dips. Just ridiculous."
20860,E,N,F,P,I remember my friend telling me about the leaks and I didn’t want to believe it....but they ended up being true. Sigh.
20861,E,N,F,P,"Yeah, Season 5 had me in a panic because I realized my favorite show in the world was slowly going up in flames. When I read about the “bad pussy” in an online meme, I thought it was a joke. Then I watched the actual episode and saw it was a straight up line from the series...

Also that fight in the Dorne palace court yard with Jamie and Bronn felt like a scene pulled from a shitty early 90’s action TV show."
20862,E,N,F,P,"The prequel series will for sure suck, but I must admit I am still curious to see what it will look like and who will be cast."
20863,E,N,F,P,I felt that too....the whole killing seemed so lazy and mostly for shock value.
20864,E,N,F,P,"I’m sorry you lost your passion for the book series...I’m still looking forward to the next one. But yeah, with the show’s conclusion, it’s getting harder and harder to care, considering we all now know how the main plot points will tie up. 

Also had the same feelings as you throughout Season 5 and 6. Season 7 was when it became apparent to me that they were no longer trying."
20865,E,N,F,P,Lemmings hahaha
20866,E,N,F,P,"Yeah you were right not to indulge, but I just had to see it through to the end."
20867,E,N,F,P,"Jesus Christ, you’re so right about that lmfao. I wasn’t even thinking about it, but yeah, why in the hell weren’t they under the cover of night, in some remote channel?"
20868,E,N,F,P,"I’ve thought about this quite a bit. I personally think the answer is capitalism. It takes time to write a good story. Oftentimes it takes years and years. Studio execs want to generate a shit ton of money by pumping out crowd pleasers season after season, whether the writers can keep up or not. Capitalism also dictates that exciting, new concepts for shows be immediately put into production before the writers even know how the story will eventually develop and conclude. It’s playing with fire and the shitstorm of failed TV show endings we’ve witnessed in the past few years is testament to that."
20869,E,N,F,P,I’m kind of shocked there were no medieval war experts or military tactics advisors on set or in pre-production to say something? Isn’t something like that par for the course on a show of this magnitude?
20870,E,N,F,P,"YUP. Why did she have to die anyway? Where exactly did she come from? What was her whole purpose in this story? Did she *really* do anything that affected the plot in a significant way? She raised Jon Snow from the dead, but there were no changes to his character thereafter, and he ended up not being Azor Ahai...."
20871,E,N,F,P,But don’t you want to see what all the hate is about????
20872,E,N,F,P,Exactly
20873,E,N,F,P,Her eyes look like fake eyes painted on closed lids.

20879,E,N,F,P,This is a very accurate assessment.

20882,E,N,F,P,"Ugh same!! If someone goes down on me, it’s like being licked on any body part, with an occasional ticklish feeling or tingle."
20883,E,N,F,P,"No I am not on any meds, and have never given birth."
20884,E,N,F,P,"Second this. I’ve tried both the womanizer and wand many, many times and have yet to orgasm."
20885,E,N,F,P,HAHAHA
20886,E,N,F,P,"Whoa sorry, my phone was glitching, it deleted most of my post and what is you see is that single letter haha. I was just say this is a totally mind blowing analysis and I love it!!!! I’ve been thinking about it the past few days and really resonate with this interpretation."
20887,E,N,F,P,D
20888,E,N,F,P,True!!
20889,E,N,F,P,"OMFG I have never related to a meme so hard. Everyone was still holding out hope for Season 8 and I was like, “5 and 6 were already going bad, but there is literally no redemption from the shitshow that was Season 7.”"
20890,E,N,F,P,HAHAHAHHAHAHA YESSS
20891,E,N,F,P,"Sorry for how long this response is, I just had lots of thoughts lol. 

Thank-you for your insight. I appreciate it very much and you’ve given me very helpful tools in how to approach the INFP belief system. 

Believe it or not, I rarely openly clash with INFPs. If one says something I disagree with—and even then, this doesn’t happen a lot—99% of the time I just shrug it off and think, “That’s their perspective! Fine by me.” 

However, my best friend, for example (who is INFP and quite opinionated) makes a ton of biased statements that she expects everyone else to acknowledge is true. I have always tried asking her politely how she came to her conclusions (much in the method you suggested), and after going back and forth for several minutes it came down to her making a judgement which, in my head, is based off of incorrect assumptions. For example, she told me recently she doesn’t think sharing information about Black Lives Matter online actually does anything to further the cause, and that no one actually changes their opinions reading these online posts/articles. I tried to point out to her that much of the BLM movement happened *because* people read these posts online and changed their views, myself included. But she was obstinate. After I asked her several more questions in order to ascertain why she felt this way, it all came down to the fact that she was reading the BLM posts of a particular friend of ours and she didn’t like how self-righteous the friend sounded. She assumed that everyone else felt the same way and that all BLM posts are self-righteous—therefore no one actually cares about the message BLM is trying to put out. And I inwardly felt that drawing that conclusion was silly. 

Another time she was expressing disgust at this movie that was about cheating. She said, “I don’t even know why this movie was made.” When I asked her why she felt that way, she replied, “Because people are gonna watch that movie and it will encourage them to cheat.” And I was just like, “But just because a movie is about cheating doesn’t mean that people will cheat after watching it?” But she looked at me like I was crazy. Without going in to detail about her past, I know she has dealt with the harmful effects of cheating, and knowing how she draws feeling-based conclusions, I could not help but feel she was just projecting. But I could not say any more after that because I didn’t want to argue and she was very passionate. 

So, like, I always want to honor my INFP friends’ feelings, I guess I just have trouble taking them seriously when they’re coming (at least to me) from a biased place. I know that sounds harsh. I always do try and seek to understand, because believe me I don’t ever want to argue or get in fights with people. 

I guess it all comes down to how we take in information. I know INFPs draw conclusions about how the world is mostly by how certain objects, people, ideas, and situations make them feel. I really want to make an effort to exercise more understanding and empathy in interacting with this style of thinking because tbh of all the types whom I would trust with making feeling-based decisions, it’d be INFPs because 9 times of of 10 their hearts genuinely are in the right place. And I do appreciate that. Which is why I value my INFP relationships much."
20892,E,N,F,P,"Wow, okay so this is definitely the type of response I wanted to hear. Thank-you for your words. Seriously. I will be thinking about them deeply the next few days. Even writing my post made my realize how weak my Fi is, and that I’ve been using my Ne to buffer life’s more unpleasant truths and pains, usually to the detriment of honoring how I feel on the inside—something INFPs do naturally, even if it results in an outburst. Looks like we could all learn a little bit from each other.

PS I had roommates who used to criticize me politely and it made my anxiety skyrocket. I wish they would have just been more blunt, because pointing things out nicely is sometimes just a cue that they’re probably holding in more anger."
20893,E,N,F,P,"Honestly, thank-you for this :) :) I am trying to accept that sometimes people aren’t ready to process things, but with time and growth they will eventually come around. This can be a tough pill for me to swallow since I feel close to people by being able to discuss ideas and honest, raw feelings/impressions, but I will try to pick and choose my battles. And to exercise empathy where necessary. Friendships are so important to me."
20894,E,N,F,P,Good to know other people out there also feel the struggle 😭
20895,E,N,F,P,Ahhh you get the frustration!
20896,E,N,F,P,"I feel you on this big time! I’m jealous of everyone’s sex lives, men and women lol. For me, there’s little else I can do besides painful penetration, except kiss and maybe get a massage? I don’t have much feeling in my breasts or clitoris—going down on me does nothing. And I don’t orgasm ever, not even alone."
20897,E,N,F,P,This is why I’m tired and miserable.
20898,E,N,F,P,Huh? I didn’t say I was more rational than emotional. I said my Fi is suppressed. Having strong Te certainly doesn’t render you more rationality than those who don’t possess the function.
20899,E,N,F,P,"Lulz be careful what you wish for. Half of ENFPs are the best people you’ll ever meet. The other half are clingy, constantly crack unfunny jokes, and generally talk too much."
20900,I,N,T,P,Uwu...thx senpai

20902,I,N,T,P,"I'm generally nice to everyone without overdoing it with big smiles or too-nice gestures but I never like or love anyone, but if anyone decides to go against me that's when my hidden knife comes out and normal mode off."

20905,I,N,T,P,I like the chaotic neutral ones...seems sarcastic and in-your-face kinda thing

20927,I,N,T,P,"Yeh, I like creative and appreciate beauty in things, I like art but I can't create art lmao I suck poorly at drawing and painting. But I love looking at unique and dark art on Pinterest"
20928,I,N,T,P,Accurate to the core
20929,I,N,T,P,I see
20930,I,N,T,P,Wait is this for real or just fanmade? I haven't finished the manga yet

20935,I,N,T,P,"Ehhh? But I searched up about lovebirds and it's said that they can live alone, and form potentially good bonds with owners as well"
20936,I,N,T,P,">meanings 

Oh shit...so what is a lovebird doing in those disastrous couple's room?"
20937,I,N,T,P,Wait how did you know it was a love bird?
20938,I,N,T,P,"Hm...What do you mean ""got jumped the minute he entered""?"
20939,I,N,T,P,"Same. It was Ryuk's fault first for dropping the book in the first place just because he's bored. To him, entertainment is entertainment and how many lives were lost is nothing to him"
20940,I,N,T,P,That's some long and wise answer ...I doubt what kind of inner troubles Light would confide with if he ever trusted a friend to do so...
20941,I,N,T,P,Lolll
20942,I,N,T,P,Ahh thank you...but it would be odd if L was crying 😂
20943,I,N,T,P,Yes I'm a female. Stay at home mother? I don't ever consider having a family in the future. I'm not even 20 yet but I envisioned my future to be independent and alone. In fact I've never dated anyone and have no interest in having boyfriends or husbands. I'm afraid of long relationships because of commitment. I'm not that interested in people particularly.
20944,I,N,T,P,"That's true. I found out that there's no any single distinct goal I'm chasing after. I just wanted a simple nice life, enough money to buy a nice apartment, always have free time for dramas/anime & music. I find my life boring without these two. In fact, if I ever became totally deaf I might not continue living because I can't hear music anymore."
20945,I,N,T,P,Nice
20946,I,N,T,P,"Hm, I haven't planned on what I'm becoming, but the most likely obvious job I will take is a pharmacist lol. Uni but it's a private university so all the fees are paid, not on scholarships or anything."
20947,I,N,T,P,"So, what should I do? I wanna graduate with nice grades, not drop out, basically endure all these to get a good reputation for my name as not some loser or useless dumb shit"
20948,I,N,T,P,Ah...I see. So you will just stand neutral and let everything unfold...

20954,I,N,T,J,I get mistaken for an extrovert a lot when people first meet me.
20955,I,N,T,J,I agree completely.
20956,I,N,T,J,"Not sure how to interpret that haha. I just mean that I want to have an experience like yours where the INTP woman I care about cares about me like you described, yet your experience didn’t work out either so maybe I should just accept that an INTJ/INTP pairing for me isn’t going to ever work out like I hope. 😔 Still I cant seem to help being drawn to INTP women like a moth to a flame..."
20957,I,N,T,J,As an INTJ that seems to keep falling for INTP women who don’t fall for me this one is kind of a double edged sword.
20958,I,N,T,J,I feel that way when trying to communicate with women I’m interested in.
20959,I,N,T,J,Fair enough. That said I think the direct approach _would_ work on an INTJ as long as it’s not over the top. But along with the ENTJ we may be the only ones that’s true for. <sigh>
20960,I,N,T,J,"Yeah it’s a terrible experience for an INTJ I think. Every time I fall for someone, I’m kind of like “No!!!” Inside because I know I’m going to be obsessed (but not any danger to them) and yet that will push them away (for good reason) so I have a huge internal struggle to try and play it cool when really I just want to know if they feel the same and get to know them better. Of course the direct approach is basically death with women so that doesn’t help either. In short crushes are a miserable experience for an INTJ."
20961,I,N,T,J,Even worse on HBO Max
20962,I,N,T,J,I’m disappointed the new CPUs don’t support faster RAM. I wanted to run my DDR4 4000 at full speed without hampering the CPU.
20963,I,N,T,J,Lol 😂
20964,I,N,T,J,Yes - WTH?!
20965,I,N,T,J,That’s the thing though - I’m NOT talking about just close friends. That has happened consistently with others I don’t even know yet - it’s not until later I find out they are also intuitive. In fact it’s one of the ways I can usually spot another intuitive type. And my best friend is an ISTP and I can’t get him to understand certain things while other friends I have that are intuitive (but more casual friends) will get it basically immediately.
20966,I,N,T,J,"It’s honestly hard to do so. Many times with an intuitive I can communicate more with a look than with words. I can look over at them and know they are thinking the same (or very similar) thing. With a sensor this has never happened, and even if I try to explain it until I’m blue in the face they still don’t _really_ understand. So you learn after doing this many, many times not to try anymore because it’s pointless and just causes consternation. More than once I’ve heard a sensor tell an intuitive “I don’t know what you want from me!” in frustration. And yet to another intuitive it’s as plain as day without even being said. 

So in terms of my sensor relationships I have a limit on how much I can communicate with understanding. For what it’s worth the reverse doesn’t seem to be true - they seem to think they can communicate everything they want to me and be understood. But will get frustrated if I’m trying to communicate something that they just “don’t get.”

EDIT: Just thought of this illustration. Being intuitive is like having a sixth sense - and no I don’t mean in any mumbo jumbo sort of way. I just mean if you can see and were trying to describe the color red to a person born blind how would you do it? You could communicate some things they could comprehend, but they will never _really_ understand it. Yet to another person who can see - there’s no explanation necessary. That’s what it’s like."
20967,I,N,T,J,"In my experience sensors cannot “see” the things that intuitive’s can, and they are the most common type (intuitive types are only 25% of the population roughly). This leads to communication problems between the two because they see the world very differently. And since sensors are dominant they may also (probably inadvertently) make intuitive types feel misunderstood. 

Intuitive types often enjoy MBTI because it helps them understand why they don’t fit in and find others who see the world in a similar way. Sensors often find it less interesting or even feel it puts them “in a box” which they don’t like (several sensor types have told me this, while I’ve never heard it from intuitive types). However the second letter actually make a huge difference in how you think and see the world and is therefore a significant difference in people. 

I love sensors but I also have come to understand that no matter how much I might try to explain certain things to them, they won’t really understand or appreciate them as I do. Only other intuitive types do. That doesn’t mean sensor types are bad, but it can be a sad experience when trying to communicate with them especially if it’s a close family or spouse type relationship. 

This can lead to a degree of bias as in “sensors don’t “get it”” which is true to a certain degree. That doesn’t mean they are any less intelligent, valuable, good or anything like that. It simply describes the frustration intuitives experience when trying to communicate certain concepts that are important to them with a sensor type. 

The book _Please Understand Me_ puts it this way: “__Sources Of Misunderstanding:__ Although extroversion and introversion are important differences in understanding ourselves and others, especially others we live with, these preferences are minor compared with _sensation_ and _intuitive_ ways of thinking about things. The two preferences of sensation and intuition are, of any of the preferences, the source of the most miscommunication, misunderstanding, vilification, defamation, and denigration. _This difference places the widest gulf between people._”"
20968,I,N,T,J,The internal part will be cheaper because it’s not proprietary although it will have to meet high specifications. Also it can’t be pulled out in the middle of something accidentally and corrupt your data.
20969,I,N,T,J,"When does the ability to use builders that way unlock? I’ve never used it, but I’ve seen it in some YouTube videos."
20970,I,N,T,J,How can an introverted type be the most common when extroversion is more common than introversion?
20971,I,N,T,J,I mean it’s more than just one honestly...
20972,I,N,T,J,From observation the INTJ/ENFP combo rarely works when they are young. However later in life as they both overcome some of the weaknesses of their types and grow as people it becomes a very strong potential relationship. So your experience isn’t really that surprising.
20973,I,N,T,J,I feel sorry for you. I have treated you with respect and you have attacked me for no reason.
20974,I,N,T,J,Exactly what did he say that smeared her? I think you are failing to take a joke here.
20975,I,N,T,J,You made some great points but you are so aggressive about them that it takes away from your argument. I don’t know why you couldn’t have said the same thing without being so abrasive. You’d have a better chance of being heard and understood.
20976,I,N,T,J,Feels about right for me
20977,I,N,T,J,Why are attacking so hard? I don’t get it.
20978,I,N,T,J,I hate 3 and like all the others.
20979,I,N,T,J,Why so mad?
20980,I,N,T,J,Disagree on the cost but otherwise a good idea.

20983,I,N,T,J,Well duh
20984,I,N,T,J,"It’s a great show but to be honest I think it would be better as TV-14 than TV-MA. The swearing really doesn’t add anything for me. But the characters are great, the writing is smart, the acting is terrific, and the production value is top-notch."

20987,I,N,T,J,Why?
20988,I,N,T,J,My best friend is a sensor. I was almost married to a sensor. That said there are communication challenges with sensors I don’t experience with intuitives.
20989,I,N,T,J,Same
20990,I,N,T,J,I have more...
20991,I,N,T,J,I totally relate to this

21006,I,N,F,J,"it’s so stressful and i feel creepy :( but i know it’s not even just INFJs who tend to do this, so you’re not alone. i know how it feels to just not talk to them for a long time, i had a falling out with a friend who was similar to that and it felt brutal to not get to talk to her even for just a few months. but now we’re friends again :> hopefully you guys can make up but even if you don’t i’m sure there will be even more people like that in the future :3"
21007,I,N,F,J,"god this is something that exhausts me. it normally happens in like that one time we had a one on one conversation and everything just clicked so perfectly. then we don’t talk for 5 months or something and it’s really cringy but i can’t stop obsessing over that connection at first. thing is something like that doesn’t need to exist for a great friendship, but when it does it feels so hard to let it slip away. i don’t want to initiate conversation because of nervousness but at the same time it’s all i want to do. you’re also left to constantly wonder if they also enjoyed your company as much or if they just dismissed/ disregarded it as a regular interaction. especially when they seem apathetic about it the next day"

21021,I,N,F,J,as an igcse student going into IB soon this scares me
21022,I,N,F,J,of course not. the rise of the nazis has nothing to do with that. i’m taking the stance that proportional representation was considered a problem in weimar germany and made germans themselves believe it was a weak system
21023,I,N,F,J,"our ideas surrounding monarchy are quite interesting. and how varies from time to time and place to place. at its base it’s quite a weird idea, the kings first born son is the ruler of a whole nation. i can’t see that idea being believed in without some religious persuasion"
21024,I,N,F,J,"weimar germany was quite incredible in how it managed a country that was in shambles, politically and economic, after world war 1. i love how it operated personally aside from a few flaws, especially during the late 1920s and early 30s. however their support from germans themselves always wavered. not that germans generally supported Hitler either, but many of them were still instilled with more conservative views, and disliked how slow things like proportional representation could be. as ridiculous as it sounds looking back many still wanted the monarchy to be returned. for a system like the weimar to work it needed support from its people. yet, every time there was economic trouble (after world war 1, not weimars fault and great depression, partly weimars fault) it was always affecting german support for them. it’s quite sad how people framed them as a weak republic."
21025,I,N,F,J,"as much as i love that idea, it needs to be executed well because i just have images of weimar germany in my mind"

21085,I,N,F,P,"I never even knew Nordstrom Rack actually carried gothesque/grungey boots like these in stores, especially platforms."
21086,I,N,F,P,"Yep, with the original “OC” formulas, you wouldn’t have to bother with any of this shit at all. Hell, you could swallow the original OC’s 24/7 and get almost as high recreationally, whether it’d be comparable to sniffing it, boofing it (with the exception of IV). 

With these annoying timed release tablets, you’re pretty much shit outta luck with options. You can see the desperation in the dudes who’ve tried to shoot these up, and they end up getting gel in their veins and nearly dying."
21087,I,N,F,P,"I’ve tried everything in the book for these things, known to man, and nothing else works better than soaking the cut up pieces in an acidic drink and waiting for it to eat away as much of the gel as possible."
21088,I,N,F,P,"Nah, the extended release ones absolutely suck ass for recreational purposes, especially if you literally just swallow them straight. 

Even if you chew them up or somehow cut them up, etc., it starts gelling up, and that just ends up potentially making it harder to break down. This makes it impossible to feel the effects recreationally, but you will feel it over the duration of a few hours.

Versus the soda tek, where you can keep it in a fresh acidic drink for a few hours after you cut them up, and they break down the gel as much as possible. From that point, you can chew up the rest of the bits as you drink and it’ll hit you like a train wreck. Lol"
21089,I,N,F,P,"Auto color “enhancement” lmfao

21090,I,N,F,P,"Man.... I remember the first time when I “nodded” off of about 20 mg of Norco 5/325’s with absolutely no opi tolerance at all.

Real good nostalgic times, and I hope to take a long enough break to get back to that point, aside from the money burning process of this so-called “hobby”."
21091,I,N,F,P,"I really have not seen these since middle school. And as for circumstances that would place me in scenarios where I’d be able to see them... well, that was a questionable time of my life LOL"

21094,I,N,F,P,"Let’s hope that whatever you’re snorting, is even water soluble enough to work through sniffing.... I know tramadol and methadond aren’t. And I know hydrocodone isn’t readily available by itself, so you would be snorting APAP too..... 

Your sinuses must love you."
21095,I,N,F,P,"Man, if only I had kept all of my writing.... I didn’t choose benzos, only due to the amnesia that it would generate. Opi’s were my poison of choice and I would embrace the chemical persona that it would give me. I would feel fueled and entitled by what the chemicals could drive me to do.

I hope you heal soon and start driving on the new path."

21103,I,N,T,P,"Wrong again. 

People can’t read minds. It therefore should not be surprising to any of you that you sometimes say things that others find offensive. 

You can either apologize for doing that and move on, or you can say, “what I meant was ______.” 

What you can’t do is tell the other person they’re an idiot for *their* failure to read *your* mind. Which is what you all have been doing."
21104,I,N,T,P,"It’s not “absolutely nothing.” It clearly wasn’t “absolutely nothing” to me, and it *clearly* was intended as being associative, not tautological. 

How would you feel if I said, “I’d rather hang out with chill women than dangerous men”? The implication behind that statement is that I find men dangerous. Otherwise, why did I even introduce gender as a variable in the conversation? 

I could’ve just said “I don’t like people who are dangerous,” right? 

But it turns out that’s not the same statement at all, is it?"
21105,I,N,T,P,"More to the point, who is included in “our” literary tradition?"
21106,I,N,T,P,"It’s not charged to observe that there are literally no women in *The Hobbit,* and given the prevalence of women in humanoid settlements, that absence too statistically improbable not to be deliberate. 

That doesn’t mean Tolkien was being intentionally sexist. It doesn’t even mean that the lack of representation is illogical, given who the narrator is and what his personality drives him to do (or not do, ie talk to any women). It just means that a foundational book of the contemporary fantasy genre lacks substantive women. 

That precedent has bled over to other authors and implicitly sent the message that women characters do not belong here. 

I read *The Hobbit* out loud with my dad as a little girl, and it was a great book and a formative impression of what stories could be. The overwhelming maleness of it doesn’t diminish that. 

But you know something? There are still too *many* books without women, or with token women, and it’s needless. A woman shouldn’t be less common to see than a dragon. It’s just lazy writing after a certain point. 

I could’ve stood to have more heroes as a young reader. A lot of people could have, whether they were little girls or little Black boys or they were growing up with a disability, what have you. People need to be able to read or watch or listen to a story about some unlikely hero and say, “that could be me.”

21107,I,N,T,P,"Why are you taking their side? They were completely out of line. “*You* don’t get it, but clearly people from *my* exalted fandom will understand *everything* I actually meant.” Quit gatekeeping.

Honestly our government (and the businesses that orbit it) get away with so much illegal shit because it’s not criminal, but it is tortious. And that’s only because crimes are required to have trials, while torts must be brought by a complainant and then privately funded. 

I’m painfully aware that it’s probably not possible for you to sue them. You do, however, have standing to do so, as does everyone in your school district.

If you can leave without legal or fiscal consequences, for real, girl - fucking leave. And still strongly consider counseling, dissolution of marriage, separating your finances, etc. if you can. 

This person’s loathing is not going to get any easier with transition. If it ever improves, it will take years of therapy, and it will get worse before it gets better, because it will suddenly include self-loathing. Plus they actually have to want to work on it, which your post doesn’t point to them wanting at all. 

The video game thing might seem harmless, but what I got out of that was, “I don’t have a problem with it, so why does anyone else even care?” That’s the attitude this partner of yours is displaying. 

It’s not necessarily their fault that nobody ever taught them to be a good listener or take anyone else’s life experience seriously, but they’re an adult now and have to own their improvement."

Also, I emphasized that diagnosis because of how few emotional allowances are made for me in this world despite literally having an emotional disability. If I can deal with that, you can. Your insistence that I take your intent over your actual substance is fundamentally privileged and spoiled.

21200,E,N,F,P,Juvia will be so important upcoming chapters. I’m pretty sure she will form Aqua Era for some reason in the future. But I feel like there will be an huge angst about her too. Touka using water magic will do something. Don’t know yet. HYPE

21202,E,N,F,P,It was Gray who eats her. STILL. HAHAHAHAHAGA
21203,E,N,F,P,I don’t think so. Since the mid-aldoron arc Selene shownd as a villain.
21204,E,N,F,P,And in the end he squirts her sooo
21205,E,N,F,P,Juvia facing Bora would make it double funny.

21207,E,N,F,P,There is no way mashima continues 3 more arc just with 5 characters on his last fairy tail spin off. I think some angsty thing will happen so team Natsu and rest of the ft will had to stay together. Selene will be a problem for Jellal I assume cuz that moon foreshadowing was way too strong. And maybe white mage can choose Juvia as her new host because Touka and Juvias’s interaction implies that.

I don’t understand what you are trying to say with physical based cuz thats how they fight and die. Grays ice dameges physically, erzas swords dameges physically, natsu’s fire damages physically?? If you’re talking about something like white mages power ( which i doubt) I will not even going to argue about it anymore?

Laxus is not virgin confirmed by Larcade

Gajeel and Levy canonly not pff ( But in Larcade chapter I think Levy was but Gajeel wasn’t)

Erza is virgin confirmed by Larcade and It makes sense actually. I don’t think she even kissed.

In positions of authority like a parent, they can be controlling (they have this world view based on their experiences and traditions that to them is the right thing, and everything else is judged), manipulative, overly emotional.  

My mom is never be able to take criticism and everything is *disrespect* to her, even tho she's the verbally abusive person. I know of another ISFJ parent (my friend's) like that, and you might say it's intuitive bias, but the friend is an ISFJ and has the same issues. He has negative ISFJ traits too, but it's all fine when they're friends, because they're at an equal level so you can handle it, and be upfront. When they have authority over you though?

*And the snow is softly falling*  
*On her petticoats*  
*And she's standing in the harbor*  
*And she's waiting for the sailors In the jolly boat*   
*See how they approach?*

*With dirty hands and trousers torn*   
*They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping*  
*A gag is placed between her lips*  
*To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking*   
*Or screamin'*

*And they row her out to packets*  
*Where the sailor's sorry racket*  
*Calls for maidenhead*  
*And she's scarce above the gunwales*  
*When her clothes fall to a bundle*  
*And she's laid in bedOn the upper deck*

*And so she goes from ship to ship*  
*Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned*  
*'Til at last she's satisfied*  
*The lot of the marina's teeming minions*  
*In their opinions*

*And they tell her not to say a thing*  
*To cousin, kindred, kith or kinOr she'll end up dead*  
*And they throw her thirty dollarsAnd return her to the harbor*  
*Where she goes to bed*  
*And this is how you're fed*

*So be kind to your mother*  
*Though she may seem an awful bother*  
*And the next time she tries to feed you collard greens*

*Remember what she does when you're asleep*  
*Remember what she does when you're asleep*"
21262,I,N,T,P,A very difficult treatment too. Become more extroverted? Boost my social life? ((shudders))
21263,I,N,T,P,You mean ENTPs aren't lazy?
21264,I,N,T,P,"It's not about manipulating. I meant that some of them don't take insulting ((jokes)) like that well, in my experience."
21265,I,N,T,P,What?
21266,I,N,T,P,"Uhhhh no, not in my experience."
21267,I,N,T,P,Or maybe some of them really are just stuck up snowflake INFJs.
21268,I,N,T,P,I thought she was ISFP
21269,I,N,T,P,"Huh I got ENTP, probably because of the more developed Fe, but I'm also the most introverted person I know."
21270,I,N,T,P,I don't intentionally do stuff but I've often spilled acids in the lab. Almost tripped once and everything sloshed out of the beaker.
21271,I,N,T,P,"Objectively, ENTJ and ISTP seem like the best types to me. I still wouldn't change my type though, if I could."
21272,I,N,T,P,"Definitely an r/shittyMBTI type of meme, but it's also you who's thinking mass killing is the ""smart"" idea and planting is a stupid idea so."
21273,I,N,T,P,"Ah yes. ""Politics isn't for you, you're too young."""
21274,I,N,T,P,sometimes all you can do is smile or *laugh.*
21275,I,N,T,P,"Huh, I see. Thank you for the reply."
21276,I,N,T,P,"I'm INTP and I like play fighting. But I mean physically, I don't mind the verbal kind but I'm honestly not great at dishing out insults."
21277,I,N,T,P,"Whaa, haven't you watched the cartoons? Smh."
21278,I,N,T,P,"Hey don't apologise that was a joke haha. Thanks in fact, I *really* should drink more water."
21279,I,N,T,P,:(
21280,I,N,T,P,Oh wow you guys dated for that long before meeting in person? That's amazing
21281,I,N,T,P,Unrelated but that username reminded me to drink water. Still too lazy to actually drink it tho
21282,I,N,T,P,"I don't mean in a professional setting though. The meme says ""they desperately want people to think well of them"" and that seems more about acquaintances and friends. And the anxiety that OP mentioned? Yeah you don't get that sort of anxiety if it's just about wanting to get hired."
21283,I,N,T,P,Why care about the people who'll only treat you better because you look good?
21284,I,N,T,P,no
21285,I,N,T,P,I got Chaotic Neutral when I took the test
21286,I,N,T,P,"My INTJ friend is the one always cracking jokes and I'm the serious one, although! I'm the one who laughs easily at things, while it can be hard to get a laugh out of *him*."
21287,I,N,T,P,"Nah, I'd like to know WHY."
21288,I,N,T,P,Yeah tell me why.
21289,I,N,T,P,fail yer lessons
21290,I,N,T,P,"> Patrick Star is the first one in the series to notice the clear inconsistency behind the natural principles of their ocean. He questions why there is even fire in the first place, when they live underwater. 

&#x200B;

>He is too oblivious of his own feelings and he has weird and unusual way of thinking. I mean he has a lot of thoughts in his head, it's just that he probably can't come up with the words to express them. Patrick is more in the head than in the heart. He is stupid by the standard of society but he's actually smart in a weird way. He is a clear Ne user that's why he always comes up with imaginative non-sense thoughts that he shares with Spongebob like ""The inner machinism of my mind is an enigma."". It's just weird but somehow it's true... I mean how can a stupid starfish come up with things like that? Oh.. and also.. Patrick is cunning and mean towards Spongebob sometimes. Like in the Dumped episode. He ""steals"" Gary from Spongebob in a subtle way. He is stupid, yes, but how can he play with Spongebob's feelings like that? rather than supporting Sponge? It hurts Spongebob's feelings but Spongebob is too innocent to know what his best friend does subtly to him. So yeah, Patrick uses his brain more than his heart. He has dominant Ti, proven by how weird his thoughts and cunning his actions are towards innocent guy. 

That was the explanation for Ti on there  
More on Ne

>Ne: He is a chatterbox when talking about something that catches his interest, and he is always bouncing from idea to idea. He is very indecisive about everything, as when presented with a situation he always sees a lot of possibilities to solve it and can’t decide which one to pick. He always gets distracted by new ideas when trying to follow stuff though, often leading to him forgetting what he was doing in the first place. This is why he is terrible at planning and following things through. 

So yeah, that's some of the reasons on the site."
21291,I,N,T,P,"well if you look at the comments (explanation for the typing), it doesn't sound too bad."
21292,I,N,T,P,"Yeaah I know about that, was confused because I kept seeing the odd ""an""s."
21293,I,N,T,P,"this is totally unrelated but ""an"" robot? Like is that actually correct or what, I'm genuinely confused because I see people adding ""an""s to words that don't make sense (to me)."
21294,I,N,T,P,"Oh philosophy opens a whole different topic then. I just meant in general, the colloquial implies the general idea of a life is seeking thrill, while in other places chasing that success is exactly what most people aspire to do. Or something entirely different. So yeah, different ideas."
21295,I,N,T,P,"Yeah I suppose. Just funny, there's some drastically different general ideas for what ""a life"" is supposed to be."
21296,I,N,T,P,So that's what a life is?
21297,I,N,T,P,"Why's focusing on their career ""no life"" anyway."
21298,I,N,T,P,"That's probably true. But unreasonable prejudice against different races seems a bit too far for a *stereotype*. As far as I know, INTPs can at least be more open minded compared with some other types."
21299,I,N,T,P,"Tonks, all the sand animals on Taldain."

21352,I,N,F,P,"I second this, this is the content I need"
21353,I,N,F,P,"Ok I am officially terrible at reading I am sorry. I hope this answers your questions

For myself: I decided on Ne over Se because I’m a dreamer and idealist :’) I love working with abstract ideas and thinking about all the possible directions I could take. Sometimes I get more excited planning things than I do when the actual things happen. I’m also god awful at noticing immediate details of my environment and coordinating my body, things which would come more naturally to a high Se user.

For Billie Eilish: I feel like she’s pretty grounded in the present and physical reality. She has said she likes to think about the future (plus her song about it) but it seems like for her, being in the present comes first and the future comes after. As a Ne-Si user I tend to daydream first, and at the end of the day I’ll reminisce about past memories. It seems like for her the details of the present are more immediate and then she wonders about the future afterward, which strikes me more as Se-Ni. High Ne users are driven by possibilities- she seems intrigued by the future but not particularly energized by it. 

This is my impression, I could be wrong. I’m curious about how you’d make the case for INFP!"
21354,I,N,F,P,Se is more present-oriented and literal (what is) and Ne is more possibility-oriented and abstract (what could be). Usually watching interviews is a good way to figure it out.
21355,I,N,F,P,"Billie Eilish is the first that comes to mind. PersonalityDatabase has a list: https://www.personality-database.com/personality_type/ISFP

Edit: Disclaimer, not all of these are guaranteed to be ISFP but it’s a good place to look"
21356,I,N,F,P,Thanks!
21357,I,N,F,P,I never thought about perceived feelings vs. actual feelings before. Thanks!
21358,I,N,F,P,"Ah thank you for writing this out, this is so well put!"
21359,I,N,F,P,F for OP 😢💜
21360,I,N,F,P,"This is super interesting, thanks for writing it out!"
21361,I,N,F,P,:O do you have more information on this hidden line toward 4
21362,I,N,F,P,🤣 Thomas had never seen such bullshit before
21363,I,N,F,P,"yess this 100%. and re: other comment, avoiding drama is a big plus, I wish I appreciated it earlier. before I realized I was on the aspec I felt broken and forced myself into shitty situations to try to make up for something I thought I was missing. all that drama could’ve been avoided if I learned  about asexuality earlier and that it is valid.

sending love- your worth as a person is not measured by whether or not you have a partner, and the world needs to learn that 💕"
21364,I,N,F,P,"ack I relate to this. I’m not sure if this is also you, but for me it was about learning to think about what I want and setting boundaries accordingly. imo it’s fine to not share much about yourself- but whether that’s a good move depends on what you want out of the conversation/relationship. do you *want* to open up to this person and become closer with them?

-if not, then you’re all good. you have no obligation to share more with them than you feel like sharing. there’s no hidden expectation for more. if you don’t want to get closer with them, then they simply don’t get the privilege of hearing your stories :P

-if yes, then try taking the risk and see how they respond! their response might surprise you. sharing more of yourself is an indication that you trust them (which is kind of a compliment).

it took me a long time to start seeing my friendships this way- that getting to know me better is a privilege and not an expectation waiting to be met. some people will always be acquaintances, and I will only ever share the shallow details of my life with them. often my gut tells me someone wouldn’t be interested in what I have to say so I don’t say it, and that’s okay. I know when I meet someone who’s really interested in getting to know me/who’s worth opening up to, I’ll feel it. seeing that I’m in control of my relationships and what I share helps me take up more space when I do choose to share!

remember you are in control and trust your gut🙂"
21365,I,N,F,P,wow this is a comment I needed to read- thanks for writing this in such a candid and nonjudgmental way 🙂 if you are willing to share I would love to hear more of your advice on letting go of others’ opinions/accepting who who you are!
21366,I,N,F,P,you had me in the first half there
21367,I,N,F,P,"> I want them to feel like they can tell me anything cause I genuinely just wanna get to know them.

can I just say that reading this made me happy and I wish I knew more people like you 💙"
21368,I,N,F,P,wow this is beautiful and very accurate LOL I was thrown off guard for a moment
21369,I,N,F,P,wait I just checked the last time this happened and it was also you 😂

21372,I,N,F,P,omg that feeling when you make eye contact with your thinker friend and immediately know they won’t relate to what you’re about to say ;-;
21373,I,N,F,P,wow this is incredibly on point
21374,I,N,F,P,"Ooh, thanks for this!"

21385,I,N,F,P,"> Apparently saying sadly, ""I am sad"" didn't count as emotions because it was not accompanied by tears, threats or something more dramatic.

Ugh this 100%"
21386,I,N,F,P,"I like using Alexa to set timers and remind me when to switch between tasks. Voice interfaces are great because I can do things without using a screen or being distracted by push notifications, so it’s easier to keep my flow."

21388,I,N,F,P,Next let’s see him plug in a USB drive the right way on first try
21389,I,N,F,P,"Here’s a definition of [hookup culture](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hookup+culture). [Here’s](https://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/blog/details/726/what-hookup-culture-means-for-the-future-of-millennial) an article I found with a quick Google search. Hookup culture is by definition a culture that emphasizes casual sex over other aspects of dating (e.g. longer-term connections and deeper emotional bonds). It’s become more popular in recent years.

It doesn’t sound like you understood my comment. If you read my comment you’ll see I agree with you that “not every person who likes to fuck around is shallow and lacking in emotion.” And I never said that Allos or Demis are superior when it comes to emotions and feelings. Honestly, it doesn’t sound like you even wanted to understand my comment, you seem committed to calling me rude no matter what I say.

The things you champion are all good-hearted (fighting against discriminatory stereotypes, being inclusive and open-minded) and I support them but imo your outrage is very misdirected here. A big part of being open-minded is listening to, considering, and understanding other people’s opinions. I think you should try doing that too."
21390,I,N,F,P,"I hear you, but I don’t think the photo is shitting on them for being different. I also don’t think it’s about allosexuality vs. demisexuality so much as it is calling out hookup culture.

Emotional and sexual intimacy are not a zero-sum game (you can have both), and emotional intimacy is something that humans need, demi or allo. So the photo is pointing out how hookup culture has become so widespread that most people look for sex only, while neglecting emotional intimacy. Which is a mindset that is ultimately detrimental to their relationships’ longevity.

I can see how the particular wording “don’t have much to offer” can be seen as rude- I see it more as “don’t offer much.” With hookup culture, people are capable of emotional intimacy just like anyone else, they just don’t give as much thought or effort to it as they should.

Edit: wording and paragraph splits for readability"
21391,I,N,F,P,same!!! I feel like I need to swallow it but it sits uncomfortably in my head for the rest of the day
21392,I,N,F,P,"feeler here- many people (especially feelers) need to heal from difficult emotions before they feel ready to approach a problem in a practical/solution-oriented manner. they do want your solutions, but not until they’re ready to use them.

you can think of it as a two-part problem: (1) the emotional part (making them feel heard by listening and sympathizing with their experiences, until they feel better) and then (2) the practical part (helping them come up with the best way to fix their problem). jumping to the practical part, even with helpful intentions and a solid solution, can come off as dismissive because it overlooks the problem they’re more immediately seeking help with- the emotional one. this is usually why people don’t react well when given solutions- chances are they’re seeking validation and reassurance first. in this case, suggesting solutions right away could imply that their problem is no big deal, a quick fix- when what they need to hear is that their problems are very real, you understand their struggle, and you’re there for them.

I hope this helps, I can see how this can be confusing and annoying for y’all as Te-aux users. sigh emotions are hard man 🙃"

Another kid had been homeless before and ended up going to a top liberal arts school. He was able to attend a good city school bc his white relative worked there. He had to work in high school and would put money into his parents' wallets. On top of that, went through the same gifted educational programs I did.

21424,I,S,F,P,Studying for 2hrs straight without breaks 🤔
21425,I,S,F,P,Thanks for the down-to-earth post! and keeping things simple starting with 1 task instead of trying to plan 10hrs of my day lolz
21426,I,S,F,P,"Sounds like really low self esteem and depression. Doing or saying something wrong shouldn't be a huge deal unless you're being a bigot, obviously hurting others, etc. It's easy to feel some shame or embarrassment when you mess up certain things, but that's no where near those extreme reactions"
21427,I,S,F,P,"Can't believe this is real. Also, so the anatomy models are literally how it looks below the skin"
21428,I,S,F,P,of course. Not sure where I read it but if you get too little sleep like 1hr then of course. Or if you are predisposed to mental health conditions then sleep deprivation can push you over the edge
21429,I,S,F,P,Can't trust their judgment at all since they believe in conspiracy theories
21430,I,S,F,P,"Personally, I ascribe to the theory that it's not necessarily growth unless it's healthy qualities and behaviors. When unhealthy, I can impose expectations on others or act like an unhealthy 1 by being too hard on myself and others."
21431,I,S,F,P,Maybe I'm sx Sx primary as opposed to so primary instinct
21432,I,S,F,P,"I'm a 4w3 but have also done that due to perfectionism. The all or nothing applies to me too, and I think it's because 4s always know what's missing, even though it may seem fine to others. Sometimes I hold myself to my own standards, but fail because it's never possible to find a perfect balance in a situation like that."
21433,I,S,F,P,Doesn't happen when I lose it and just express them completely or vent.
21434,I,S,F,P,"You can change your behaviors and start acting like other types to grow. Also 4s do have healthy qualities such as being empathetic, understanding other's emotions and navigating emotions in general, knowing what's missing can help to have a better picture occasionally. Also, in my opinion, striving for significance can be a good thing if it motivates you to be healthy and adopt healthy behaviors. 

4s are the odd ones out, especially at their worst, but we understand the depths and emotional complexities of life better. With this, we can help others and also understand their perspectives/ where they're coming from. Personally, I can feel for others on an empathetic or near empathetic level even if I disagree with what they're doing. However, I can validate their stories, experiences, and hardships."
21435,I,S,F,P,At least you're another type 4. I was gonna be like why is there ANOTHER meme roasting type 4s
21436,I,S,F,P,"Personally I act more like a 9 or 1 when I'm healthy, likely so dominant instinctual variant as well. It helps me to get out of my head, be considerate of others, and get more in touch with my body and surroundings to get stuff done and help others. 

Do you focus on other people's feelings or your own? Average 9s are probably more positive and upbeat than average 4s."
21437,I,S,F,P,I thought prices drop because of an abundance of oil.
21438,I,S,F,P,"That kind of stuff should disqualify you from getting admitted into MD programs. Why not save the seats for people who actually care about health and medicine, while meeting basic premed requirements ofc"
21439,I,S,F,P,"Where the f*** is this? Masks are literally common sense, not even science. I bet people without any formal education in certain parts of Asia will still wear masks. Rather it is the reasoning that could lead to someone questioning the efficacy of certain masks through air flow, particle size, but that has clearly been disproved by science. 

No wonder y'all have too many extracurriculars and all that time. I don't want to know where to find these premeds. Maybe in the rural areas. Still absolutely horrified. It's one thing to be for preventive health and complementary treatments, it's another to be like this. Technically masks are preventive health, so whoever is trusting in whatever fads, supplements, or whatever, masks are more effective against coronavirus"
21440,I,S,F,P,work too.
21441,I,S,F,P,"Or be an ND. When I realized what they were actually about, not just complementary medicine, I was shocked."
21442,I,S,F,P,"well, they'll hate their jobs, with burnout rates from ~30-40% across specialties. even people who love the physician role burnout."
21443,I,S,F,P,Why is Walmart the place to find cash? Speaking from past experience and anecdotes but never encountered anything more than $10
21444,I,S,F,P,"Probably referenced in the type 4 description. Not sure, just saying"
21445,I,S,F,P,I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about my friends.
21446,I,S,F,P,3 out of 4 family members. also not my family
21447,I,S,F,P,I'm not talking about myself. wdYm
21448,I,S,F,P,And my 9 friends don't tell me that they're not doing well...
21449,I,S,F,P,How do you explain a family of  8's (3/4)? 1 parent and 2 kids
21450,E,N,T,P,Ok thank you. Yes not funny
21451,E,N,T,P,I don’t get it...what is chloroform?
21452,E,N,T,P,"It’s actually a feminist perspective, a famous French feminist, Virginie Despentes,  introduced me to this theory. And other comments said the same thing and you didn’t remove their comments..."

21459,E,N,T,P,"Yes same. I have ADHD and I can’t even concentrate myself on one thing. So 2 things ? Not at all! I have the feeling that people without ADHD are the ones who can do 2 things at the same time, like for exemple listening in class while drawing."
21460,E,N,T,P,It’s an hour from where I live !
21461,E,N,T,P,This kind of behavior is more Fe than Fi tho
21462,E,N,T,P,I love it !
21463,E,N,T,P,Oh I love this picture !
21464,E,N,T,P,"As a straight girl, I feel the same. But I met a really awesome guy who respects me a lot and is really sweet. My ex boyfriend was abusive and he helped me to recover from him. He restored my faith in men !"
21465,E,N,T,P,"Told my boyfriend that I liked Charli and he told me « the girl that made boom clap ? You are still listening to this song ? » as if it was the only song in her discography...a lot of people associate her with this song and nothing else, so this is why they don’t like her"
21466,E,N,T,P,"Because I always thought I was a 4w5, but then realised that my 5 wing was stronger than I thought. I’m really sensitive, creative and I have a strong artistic sense. I’m often depressed and I have obsessive thoughts, which are also common type 4 traits"
21467,E,N,T,P,"When I go to a party, I’m super enthusiastic for almost an hour and then my social batteries are down, I’m tired and I want to go home."
21468,E,N,T,P,"Same !! I thought I was a 5w6 because I felt a lot of anxiety. But anxiety is not a exclusive to the type 6, 5w4 people feel also a lot of anxiety because: the types  5 overthink everything so they are very likely to feel anxiety, and the 4 wing makes us sensitive, and sensitivity is often linked with overwhelming emotions, just like anxiety"
21469,E,N,T,P,"r/Cringetopia is a transphobic, homophobic and sexist sub tho"
21470,E,N,T,P,r/menslib is cool if you want to talk about men’s issues without being sexist or anti-feminist
21471,E,N,T,P,Is it Tarkovsky or Tarkovski ? It seems that people say both
21472,E,N,T,P,I found it on William Ndatira’s instagram account
21473,E,N,T,P,"In France it’s now forbidden for middle school and high school girls to wear a crop top or a short skirt at school. The minister who said that said that it’s going to distract boys, and that he himself finds middle school girls wearing crop top and short skirts distracting."
21474,E,N,T,P,Because the patriarchy and rape culture is higher in these countries
21475,E,N,T,P,"Well, good for them"
21476,E,N,T,P,"Thanks to this drawing, I noticed the baby face on the left ! Didn’t know it existed before"

21484,E,N,T,P,Yes! Especially for girls who do horse riding

21488,E,N,T,P,Thank you !
21489,E,N,T,P,I made her smile !
21490,E,N,T,P,I hate this word as well. Some comments here say that people use it as a « scientific context » but every time I see it it has nothing to do with science. It’s like:  « female on tiktok are so slutty » « females are so bad at making memes » etc. It’s always negative towards women
21491,E,N,T,P,[She does love this kind of memes ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/iau6gd/dogma_shouldve_shot_him_in_the_face_multiple/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

21495,E,N,T,P,"Yes ! Haha, didn’t know about the rest of shygirl’s songs"
21496,E,N,T,P,Oh ? Didn’t know that. Thought sega bodega only produced requiem  and CC
21497,E,N,T,P,Yeah watch is good ! Did you hear shygirl’s featurings with sega bodega ?
21498,E,N,T,P,Yes the whole album is amazing

I have to remind myself of this more often haha

I’m glad your new relationship turned out better"
21503,E,N,T,P,I’m never selfish in bed anyway but thanks I guess. Was your ex selfish in bed? Since you brought it up like that...
21504,E,N,T,P,I have an estp (best)friend and the amount of luck he has in general sometimes can be downright annoying
21505,E,N,T,P,">the nurses all loved him of course

Why I’d rather be an estp in a nutshell"
21506,E,N,T,P,">people suck


That’s the point ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

I’ve long lasting friendships and have had long term relationships so at core I don’t think I’m too problematic. But I’d like to have more close friends


I think most people consider me to have a cold and unfazed appearance in general but this feeling sometimes gets so intense yet i feel as though I can never open up to my full potential. Leading me to think that there is something wrong with me cuz I can’t easily do what most others can."
21516,E,N,T,P,"Quality time, Acts of service and physical touch is way more prominent than others for me

21522,E,N,T,P,I was just slightly hoping that we’d still have some “high grounds” left.

21524,E,N,T,P,She looks very smug about it
21525,E,N,T,P,Someone better call Sia
21526,E,N,T,P,"Worst part is I don’t know if I have the imposter syndrome or I’m actually inept and inadequate

According to the page:

The impostor cycle


The need to be special or the best (check)


Characteristics of superman/superwoman


Fear of failure (kinda check)


Denial of ability and discounting praise (check)


Feeling fear and guilt about success


So yeah... problem is; how do I actually achieve something before I die alone and poor and unsuccesful?"
21527,E,N,T,P,"Didn’t mean to come off as aggressive but I wasn’t aiming to inform.


I was however trying to point out to the top commenter that their tone and generalization was off puttingz"
21528,E,N,T,P,"Why, because you can’t comprehend that people can be accepting of other peoples preferences? Don’t bother, I don’t expect you to."
21529,E,N,T,P,"You’re welcome! Plenty of options:

If you’re serious about an academical topic; coursera or edx have specialization courses. 

Udemy has huuuge variety of courses ranging from everyday skills, hobbies to science/engineering related stuff. Mostly very reasonable prices.

If you’d like to sharpen your language skills or practice new ones; duolingo and memrise are pretty solid to kick things off."
21530,E,N,T,P,"“Meat eaters” nice condescending tone you got there.


I occasionally eat meat. I respect ~~vegans~~ everyone as long as they respect me. I wouldn’t feel any “different” if someone would’ve offered me beans or whatever. I’d gladly take them up on their offer and try different things. If I’m the host and know I’ll have vegan guests, I’d be deliberate about having vegan options on the menu.



Just because I enjoy eating fish or chicken every now and then doesn’t mean I will eat cats or humans,too. Either get the f off your high horses and stop gatekeeping stuff, or stop wondering why people hate most of you so much."
21531,E,N,T,P,"Most of the time, yes, it’s a choice. It’s a choice other people, vegan or non-vegan, should respect regardless of their stance on the matter.


Also the fact that you’re posting this on a vegan subreddit means you’re probably looking more for self-confirming opinions rather than the objective ones."

Edit: “I think it was ""If you need violence to enforce an idea, it's probably not a good idea"".

Which makes a lot more sense.”

21544,E,N,T,P,"Personality is definitely what keeps things going but that initial spark is tough to get more often than not.


And it’s not even like it’s because of I’m butt-ugly or anything. I’m definitely not model material, but real issue is I’ve been told in the past that from the outside I look strict and cold, so compared to someone who’s, say, a bit more baby face."
21545,E,N,T,P,Can you elaborate on that?
21546,E,N,T,P,"I’ve actually taken the time to find out and read the said thread; yes there are many toxic comments but there are also a considerable amount of supportive comments from both women and men. 


I believe that we should also consider what type of person the toxicity is coming from as much as the toxicity itself. Most these people, I’m pretty sure, have some of their underlying issues or perhaps unhealthy mental attitudes, so while this may seem harsh I don’t really feel like giving them credit on their unhealthy,hypocritical opinions. For analogy sake consider how much credit you would give some incel guy when he says something about women, or consider how seriously you’d take an fds girl talking about men.


As someone put it briefly: “as a society we have a long way to go”, but I wanna believe irl there are more progressive,supportive and good people out there than otherwise. This is internet, afterall.

I'll be happy to give you song recommendations if you like one of them :D"

21590,E,N,T,P,"That's just not true. There exists rap that is heavy in melody, rythm and harmony. You're just prejudiced (maybe even because of your musical background).
Of course it's your right to just don't like this type of music, but your objective criticism is bullshit.

And noone said anything about race btw. That wouldn't even make sense. As if only blacks would rap?"

21703,I,N,T,P,"Perfectly describes high school me. Cut to ten years, a few acid trips and countless tokes of weed later, my weirdness is significantly more under control, at least as much as I'm willing to control it ;)"
21704,I,N,T,P,"He's the first fighter introduced that originated from a PC game, that used to seem like one of those soft rules nintendo had. Like, at first it was just Nintendo brand, then they started crossing over to other consoles and developers. I only ever saw comments asking for Steve alongside ones asking for Goku and Shrek. Steve is FINE, but i think subconsciously i've been worrying about what comes next."
21705,I,N,T,P,"I love both games, but the cross over still feels weird. It's like i'm eating lasagna with peanut butter. Seems like it would have been more appropriate as mii costumes or something"
21706,I,N,T,P,It's just weird that he's the first full character in the game that was originally from the PC. Doesn't feel right
21707,I,N,T,P,"Still holding out for Tails, Crash, Rayman or Geno. Steve was literally not even a possibility in my mind, now i wouldn't be surprised to see Master Chief, or Dante, or the dude from Uncharted next... Though we all know it's going to be another Fire Emblem character."
21708,I,N,T,P,"My man, Tails, though :'("
21709,I,N,T,P,"Right? Nintendo be pumping out some weird characters and I'm here like, yeah, that's cool, but smash was already the perfect game, so these unique mechanics are feeling a bit extra"
21710,I,N,T,P,"Kinda, that's why it's difficult to explain why I'm not a fan of this choice. I'm usually a very logical person, but in this instance it's more of just a feeling of unease. Like the flood gates are opening and soon we'll have Goku and Shrek. I'll just have to wait and see how it all turns out, maybe I become a Steve main. I'm sure he'll have that annoying campy playstyle I love xD"
21711,I,N,T,P,"Watching the trailer makes me worry he's going to be another complicated gimmicky character, which by itself isn't bad, but Nintendo sure seems to be on a ""every new character needs a brand new mechanic with unique controls"" streak."
21712,I,N,T,P,"It just feels weird, it's the first representative in smash to originate on PC. I understand Minecraft is on pretty much anything with a screen now, but... Idk, it just feels unnatural. I'm not hating on the people that wanted this, but it's impossible I'm on my own in thinking this is just a strange crossover 🤷"
21713,I,N,T,P,"I like Minecraft, I grew up with it, I still feel like it's an awkward match and there's lots of other characters way more deserving of a spot in smash. I'm not like, upset, more like - unimpressed"
21714,I,N,T,P,"Not trying to hate, but I am terriblly underwhelmed by the whole situation. I like Minecraft, but it just doesn't feel right..."

21729,I,N,T,P,"Most of the time most of the community doesn't have much of a problem with the patches. It's generally like 5-10% of the community that complain incessantly and make the community appear unhappy from an observer's point of view. Blizzard has said something like that before, and went on to say it's not their aim to please everyone because that's just straight up impossible. 

 The only patches I don't care for are the ones that made Mercy a must pick. As a flex player I often got left with the job 😥"

21735,I,N,T,P,"Well, defensive ultimates are falling out of favor. No small wonder when they take AGES to charge. It's nigh impossible to earm as many transcendences as a Genji earns dragon blades. It's a better environment for characters that can shut down ults with basic abilities. Brigette immediately comes to mind, but there's also Bap's immortality field and Ana's sleep dart and grenade."

21738,I,N,T,P,"Naw dude, don't panic unless you develop an abnormal interest in heavy machinery, motorcycles and jumping in cold ass lakes."
21739,I,N,T,P,"Hmm... I used to hate being an INTP, but you don't want to be an ENTJ (they are just as broken). I would suggest finding someone who thinks your cool, quirky and mysterious. Then you fall in love with them because i'm so alone. Then scare them away with how weird and clingy i am. Then form a destructive drinking habit until I can't feel or remember anything. Also, learn guitar - it's bad ass."
21740,I,N,T,P,"Wow, and since INTPs are the best type i don't want to imagine what that means all the other types' letters must stand for"
21741,I,N,T,P,I play a fair amount of Wrecking Ball and whenever i notice this i just figure it's my fault for going in before my team was ready.
21742,I,N,T,P,Cognitive function were introduced specifically as a way to explain a person's preferences hard wired into their brain by their DNA. Experiences are what start filling in the gaps and adding color to the whole personality.
21743,I,N,T,P,"This may come as a shock, but from my experience - just go hang out with people. Get out of your comfort zone every now and then. Get to know people, learn their motivations and how they differ (or don't differ) from your own. Experiment, take mental notes (or real ones, i used to keep a journal pretty regularly when i was going through some shit) and actively try to learn how your actions are liable to make people react. It doesn't happen overnight, but just be patient and keep at it."
21744,I,N,T,P,I could never go to sleep at night because i felt guilty for all the crap i could have done. Now i'm at peace with the meaninglessness of the universe and am secure in the knowledge i don't owe anything to anyone \^\_\^
21745,I,N,T,P,"Heh, nice, my ISTP friend will get a kick out of this xD"
21746,I,N,T,P,Like I needed a graph to tell me INTP is the coolest type 😎😎
21747,I,N,T,P,"Positioning is always situational, but for Brig a general rule of thumb is to stay near allies with similar range and/or mobility as you. Just pay attention to if you're back line is being dove, Brigitte has more value as a peeler than as a pusher or initiator. Most importantly, position yourself to avoid damage until a fight breaks out. You are pretty much a sitting duck and a burden to your team until the enemy are in your range."

So he'd have to look into each suspect himself and because of the plot or his skills, L would eventually find Light. He'd just have less reason to suspect him, I guess. Also, if Ray didn't die, L would have to read each report from the investigators, and most likely find the bus hi-jacking one to be interesting. Ray dying just made L come to a conclusion faster. I could be wrong though, because I don't remember what happened there very well."

21854,I,N,F,P,"No probs, happy to help. :)

The software says it’s healthy because it only looked at the battery cycle count. It can’t tell if it’s defective or not. 

Try to do a SMC reset and see if helps. If not, then you can try re-calibrating the battery (by charing it to 100% and draining it all the way to 0%) and see if it fixed your battery issue."

21905,E,N,F,P,"Tips for more coherency:

Avoid ""Say/Do"" commands and stick to story mode.

Stick to third person (change the You words into the relevant characters.)

Change dialogues to this format:

You: (Putting hands on face) Are you serious?

Salma: (Raising both eyebrows) Of course! Why wouldn't I be?

Miss Sweet: (Shakes her head) Oh, shut up! Let me sleep.

Have a healthy balance between dialogues and narration (after switching to this format it's easy for AiDungeon to be mostly dialogues.)

**After switching to this play style I've not been invaded by vampires, werewolves, zombies, and I have not been killed instantly. Which I find an incredible improvement.**"
21906,E,N,F,P,"Haha, that'd be cool, I think I'd just use !xoxo at the beginning of the adventure and let it like that, to see how's it like."
21907,E,N,F,P,"I was that guy with the ""AI doesn't use certain words"" posts, because I played for over 60 nonconsecutive hours without the Ai using the word ""dick"" a single time, and she used it only after I used the word ""dildo"" myself. And after that instead of ""members"" or ""crotches"", it'd call them ""dicks"", and with the frequency the word was used afterwards it was clear the word ""dildo"" unlocked it all (among other examples.) Players saying ""dick"" themselves would not notice that it is absent from all the text.

I have pre-sept data to compare, it's just that... let's say it includes things that are illegal in Belgium. If I went and showed Nick example comparisons of how it used to be and how's it now, I'm afraid he'd just be horrified about the text content itself."
21908,E,N,F,P,"Oh, but it used to be easy. It used to be incredibly easy. So easy that I got used to just sending a single phrase to turn the horny switch ON, and then I didn't need to do anything else anymore, but pressing Enter until the whole scene was over (and sometimes the end of it would trigger another... producing NSFW marathons...)

As a passive, lazy player, I miss that, though I can understand why it was added if the sole mention of pants would have characters pull them down and trigger the switch, I'd had hoped Safe Mode was implemented back then so one could still use old AiDungeon."
21909,E,N,F,P,"Safe Mode only affects explicit words being used, the best things I've had the Ai produce were all written with safe words like ""manhood"" or ""wet spot"", and it seems the more explicit words are used, the more lazy the Ai becomes about it.

Are you explicitly pushing the Ai towards NSFW? Maybe that's the difference, I'm a more passive player that presses enter without sending anything to see where the story goes. This is an example:

BEFORE:

Me: Sends into Story mode:

You start unbuttoning her shirt.

AiDungeon: (produces a very detailed porn novel as I just keep pressing enter - I can just keep pressing enter for a long while and just watch what my character does with her)

NOW:

Me: Sends into Story mode:

You start unbuttoning her shirt.

AiDungeon: (Could just ignore it, or have her back off, or have me back off, or have a character leaving, or narrate that they started doing it and time skip to the future. Or get into it, but if the Ai isn't explicit herself then it's likely to not get into it and deviate on a future Enter Key press.)

My theory is that they added a script that tries to make the Ai avoid having characters have horny scenes accidentally, active players that push for it would not notice the difference."
21910,E,N,F,P,"Did you play AiDungeon before September 15? The Ai would basically always spend the next hour being horny, and it was fun to see how slight a nudge would be required for that, sometimes just mentioning that clothes exist would trigger it.

No brief jumping in and out (it's jarring when a very horny character claims they have to leave for no good reason) or time skips, that's what I call panicking.

It worked because the user could decide to go into it or not by RELOADING or continuing, now the Ai decides for you, and if it's not on the mood for it, you're not getting your hour unless you actively push it into it or are explicit, which isn't fun because I could just write NSFW by myself without the Ai.

I know I sound like a guy that keeps rambling about the good old times, and that I have no right to complain about something I get for free, but it's like I had free access to vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips, but they switch to plain chocolate, and the problem is there's no way for me to get those chips back. I expected plain vanilla so the chocolate chips were a pleasant surprise, but it's like they were being added unintentionally..."
21911,E,N,F,P,"Well, from what I gather Voicery's technology was powered by Baidu TTS:

https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/baidu/

Which only comes for Simplified Chinese, so I think all they did was training that technology for the English language. The ""Modes"" they added (Horny/Happy/Sad...) were just done by telling the voice actor to talk like that the whole training session (which is about making them read a script to produce audio fed to the AI.)

What I find weird is that Baidu TTS is open source (there's so many Baidu TTS's on Github that it's hard to know what's useful), and here's also this:

https://github.com/voicery

I think the only reason we don't have a lot of AI-Powered TTS's with the quality of Voicery is that the hardware required to do it is very expensive (Voicery was funded by $120'000, and I think they're closing down because it wasn't lucrative), as hardware costs will go down in the future I expect to have free access to those kinds of voice synthesis just like today we have access to Amazon Polly voices via ttsmp3.com , years ago it'd have been a crazy thought."
21912,E,N,F,P,">and an adventure game should have less sexual content (unless personally initiated by the player) than a porn novel

They already tacked this with their September 15 update and it just feels unnatural. Before the update, at least for those stretches, it felt like a horny writer that suddenly decided to change the genre to a porn novel, and if the user didn't like that, they were free to RELOAD and get something else.

Now it's as if the AI has multiple personality disorder, or if at the point the writer became horny, the story was given to an entirely different writer, that doesn't like that kind of stuff, so it finds a way to get out of the situation and ""adveturify"" it again.

I've seen stretches that go back and forth, and the Ai can't decide if it should go horny or not, so when the game is apparently fully ""on track"" (fully back on an adventure), suddenly... BAM! A girl mentions her big appetite for a dick...

It's like the Ai has two brains and they're fighting to take over, and I believe this is the case because of those prompts that appear to rate it (as if you would remain with this Ai if you rate it good, or switch to the other brain if you rate it badly).

As a player that enjoyed just pressing enter to see where the story went, I don't appreciate this update, I can see how other people that use what they send to force an adventure or to force NSFW content by being explicit may not notice what I'm talking about.

But this part of AiDungeon was kind of ruined because THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIX, people just should learn that RELOADING whenever something they don't like appears is the best way to play. 

It's the same if it's vampires or werevolves or Dr Kessel or the porn novel that the player doesn't like, just reload, this fudging of NSFW material was unnecessary, and didn't have the intended effect anyway (people like me that liked it became unhappy, and the people that didn't like it keep complaining about it the same as before, because whatever they added takes effect after the fact, it doesn't prevent it.)

I still find it really weird how someone getting a knife and stabbing someone else to death is acceptable, but a girl taking off her clothes makes the Ai panic and back away or speed up time so the next day begins, in what kind of society do we live?"
21913,E,N,F,P,"Heh, if they're so interested on the color of the panties of underage girls, if they went and built a scale of ""innocent to slutty"" colors for them, if that's what's on their mind when they have nothing better to do, I think they'd be the first ones to buy the service, and I don't even want to imagine what they'd simulate on it..."
21914,E,N,F,P,"This is wrong, it should be more like a Venn Diagram (where most of the Horny things are psychopathic.)"
21915,E,N,F,P,"If this is where the money's at (they could buy a Server with 4 Tesla A100 every two months) then missing this opportunity would be being short-sighted.

(because people are already using it FOR THIS anyway, and most people are using it for this, as was showcased in the leak of private stories, so at least 60% of all private stories are NSFW. Except people do it for free.)"
21916,E,N,F,P,"Thanks, it's very fun to do things like, seeing two characters talking and then just take over the dialogues of one of them, and then the other to see how they'd react to it.

It's not that I don't have a character, it's that I can be all of them."
21917,E,N,F,P,"I think your problem has been trying to do ""real time multiplayer"", I think it'd work better if people just created many stories and then continued them at their own pace (you've got some free time? Check out how the multiplayer games are doing and if something has happened, send the next line.)

And the point is to create a cool story collaboratively, not ""each player has a character and we want to live an adventure together"", because AIDungeon is at its best when there's no protagonist.

This is new technology and people haven't learned how to use it yet, AIDungeon Multiplayer should be like collaborative comic writing; that isn't real time, people just see the previous panels and decide if they draw a new one or not. Like this:

https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005543/http://beta.wedrawcomics.com/books/read/1283

(that's how I imagine AIDungeon from the future to be like, except the AI would draw a panel between what the humans send. And, oh yeah, that site died years ago, that's why I'm linking to an archive.)"

21921,E,N,F,P,"Yes. It's kind of strange that the best use I found for Wi was ""consistent age"", one character even called me out on that and asked me why I care so much about age! XD"
21922,E,N,F,P,"Sometimes it happens because you're sending similar stuff (like, you have your character say ""Okay"", then you have it say ""Okay"", so the Ai learns it should repeat stuff like you did.)"
21923,E,N,F,P,"ANYTHING.

The way it works is that what you set as Key will be triggered if it appears on the adventure, so it can be any word. And then you can set an epic chain of reactions of one key triggering another that triggers another...

Here's the guide I recommend:

21924,E,N,F,P,"Since GPT-3 was implemented the NSFW switch has absolutely NO EFFECT! What it does is that if you turn it on then people that switched it ON will appear on the Explore page.

It's only relevant when you're going to publish your Scenario or Adventure (if it's NSFW you should tag it as such before uploading it.)

Whether gore is part of NSFW depends on the discretion of the user that decided to tag it or not (those that decided gore is it will not appear unless you turn it on, but those that decided gore isn't will be shown even if you have it off.)

This doesn't affect what the AI generates at all, except it'll use words that it sees in the text (like, it'd not use the word ""Fuck"" unless it's on the text, or there's another similar word that ""unlocks"" it, and then even kids on the story will use it as an expletive.)"
21925,E,N,F,P,"Ah, right, I didn't mean to say ""a rare word"", but a ""made up word"" (alephbeth was made up - my idea is that the AI can't tell the difference between a made up word and one rare enough that it wasn't feed to it.)"
21926,E,N,F,P,"Oh, good riddance. In my stories I got fed up of the word ""killing"" due to its overuse, and have been using Alter to change it to ""touching"", and all related verbs. Though sometimes it just makes it worse..."

21930,E,N,F,P,No web version? Boo!
21931,E,N,F,P,"This isn't a limit of ""entries"", but a limit of ""tokens"". Basically you have unlimited entries that the Ai can process.

You've got 1000 tokens.

So, if the prompt you send to AIDungeon (that has a key that would trigger some entry) uses the 1000 tokens, then World Info will not be used at all.

If it's 900 tokens long, then 100 tokens will be used from World Info, and so on.

If things work like I say, that means what you should do is entering the shortest entries first, so the Ai looks at your prompt, subtracts 1000 from it and multiplies by minus one (this isn't what it does, but works the same) and then fills your remaining tokens with the entries you put there until they hit 1000.

Nobody really knows how to compute what are 1000 tokens worth of text, just that it divides words into tokens, so the more words, the more tokens (but there can be long words that use less tokens and short words that use more tokens.)

Just be aware that the entries at the bottom would not be used at all if all the tokens have been used by previous entries, for those you'd want to add Keys that would trigger them instead (if you're already using things like Ultra Sayan, Hyper Sayan, and such then they'd not interfere with each other, just don't make one that is just Sayan or it'll eat your tokens, or will not be used at all if the other variations have already used them.)"

Add other words as keys besides the place's name, such as place or location.

Add other characters in there and put:

Where Character name is changed for the character's name and place name is changed for the place's name.

And of course, you can add to Remember something like this:

21937,E,N,F,P,"I know, but last time it mentioned tongues inside of butts, the characters were kissing with their mouths, so nothing made sense. Unless it was calling their genitals tongues (and as I kept playing this was clearly the case, like he proceeded to ""get inside her tongue"".)

I'm just saying it's possible Duchess Camwald wasn't actually involved in any ass licking and she was just being penetrated from behind normally when she said her personal quote."
21938,E,N,F,P,"It's a thing meant to be played with your friends that also play AIDungeon. You're supposed to find those people wanting to play, and then create the game, and give them the link (unlike other online games where one can just play with strangers.)"
21939,E,N,F,P,"Don't get too excited, apparently the Ai uses ""tongue"" as an euphemism for genitalia."
21940,E,N,F,P,"Sorry, but I think people should be making scenarios because they enjoy making and sharing scenarios, that should be the point and not the validation.

I've seen stuff like this all over the internet, the problem is something called ""hedonic adaptation"", some people only get, say, 10 likes on average, and think that they'll be happy if they get 100. But when they do it there's this rush that makes them feel great, but then they get used to it. They no longer feel happy about it, they want more, and then it hurts them if they only get 90, even though that's 9 times more than before!

So I'm convinced all the people that don't enjoy making and sharing scenarios should stop doing it. Other users that consume their work will miss them, but ultimately people should have fun doing what they do, so instead of coming up with explanations of why their work is being ignored and telling them they should continue with it, we should let them go.

Creating scenarios is an artistic work, just like making pictures, or music, or writing a fanfic, or a poem. The quality of the work is irrelevant, the point is that the artist enjoys doing it, people that took down their content didn't enjoy producing the content, so the best thing they can do is stopping and looking for something they truly enjoy doing (they'll know it when they don't care about any validation they get.)"
21941,E,N,F,P,"Did you use a rare word before that happened? I think there's things that trigger the Ai to make up new words.

Once I made a pun because I was talking with someone with the name ""Aleph"", and I was going to talk about the alphabet, but I made a pun and called it ""alephbet"", and then corrected myself with ""oops, I meant alphabet.""

The Ai didn't get the pun, but it detected that I was trying to be humorous and that I made up a word, so Aleph went and made a joke that included the word ""chechicahoa.""

The word chechicahoa was made up on the spot by AIDungeon like shpëndetanjë, so it'll just do that if it thinks it's what she's supposed to do, I think."
21942,E,N,F,P,But the top part was generated by AIDungeon.
21943,E,N,F,P,"I could never have something like that, I was told if I met my future self the universe would come to an end, so it was basically about avoiding meeting myself."
21944,E,N,F,P,"GPT-3 became blazing fast when they added Pagination, actually, I remember that the story would start blazing fast, then as time went on and the story became bigger and bigger, GPT-3 would become very slow, to the point playing on a very long story would cause it to take 15 seconds to send something.

When Pagination was added and it covered only the last 100 actions, what it generated was instant, then it went back to blazing fast when they increased them to 1000.

The ""poor quality text"" you're experiencing might be their September 15's update, I pointed it out on this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/iwyvy6/the_new_aidungeon/

This was very unlike the AIDungeon I used back in September 14, they added some kind of filter to what the user sent, or what the AI sent, or a detector that activates and changes things up.

Now AIDungeon can see some words and just make characters stop what they're doing and leave, or just insert a ""Meanwhile..."" and go to a completely unrelated place with unknown characters on the story.

I suspect this was to decrease the times the AI goes to NSFW material by itself, as the detector can make it back off from it (while before it'd be fully embraced) and requires users to push the AI into it (but I've not seen the detailed stuff I used to see before this update again.)

But it's still GPT-3 (mostly), you can see because GPT-2 is unable to get some examples and produce something new on its own (like video titles with thumbnails in a website), GPT-3 can, and AIDungeon does it, users just need to do stuff when/if AIDungeon switches to GPT-2 for some reason."
21945,E,N,F,P,"Thanks for your experiments. I think it sometimes falls back to GPT-2. I suspect sometimes it does it when GPT-3 ""doesn't know what to say"" (it uses GPT-2 instead of telling that to the user), and that some of the times the prompt to rate the AI appears is to query if the user is happy with GPT-2 so it'll remain being used unless it's rated ""Not So Good...""

It's very clear this is happening when a highly intelligent character suddenly can't build coherent phrases, but I'm always able to make GPT-3 ""click back"".

It's curious that when these kind of discussions appear on Reddit, Nick stays silent about them, he could easily say something like ""GPT-3 is being used all the time, what you're seeing is caused by this or that"", but instead he lets users speculate about how everything works. Perhaps he has spent a lot of time working on this (how to use GPT-2 as much as possible while simultaneously keeping most users rating it as ""Mindblowingly Good"" with help from GPT-3), and doesn't want to tell anybody how he did it so they can't just go and copy his job."
21946,E,N,F,P,"I suggest you try to run the Colab version to see if you like it, because if you go through all the trouble only to finally be able to run something you don't like, all you're going to find is disappointment.

People already set it up for you and will allow you to run it on their hardware for free, check this link:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/nickwalton/AIDungeon/blob/master/AIDungeon_2.ipynb

Get a Google account (or get into your gmail email) and click Copy to Drive. Upload the model to your Drive so it can be used. Once you're running the one of your account you'll see these things:

[ ]

When you hover over them, they'll change into a Play Button. Click this button and let it run until it's done, then go to the next [ ] and run that too, and so on.

If the Play button turns red and you get an error, it'll probably be because you were assigned a system without enough RAM for this. You can try making it use your system on settings, or you can try again and hope you were assigned a system with more RAM this time (it never takes me more than 3 tries, so you'll be good.)

If after managing to do all this you think it sucks, then that'll be the end of the story."

21960,I,N,F,J,You soon will if you keep it like that 😔
21961,I,N,F,J,🤗🤗🤗🤗
21962,I,N,F,J,Ok..then I am confused... Why are you even asking for an opinion then?
21963,I,N,F,J,Then dont complain when men treat you like an easy woman since you give such vibes
21964,I,N,F,J,You are gorgeous 😍
21965,I,N,F,J,"Yup, you might be an ESFP.  So...it's just the way you present yourself, but this is who you are, so its not your fault. Its just that maybe women are looking for other types of people, who knows. But most of them are actually looking for guys of your type, so do not despair."
21966,I,N,F,J,"I use Yves Rocher ones, which are of good quality and dont affect your skin, but in Romania the prices are decent, idk in other countries how the prices are. Just a simple eyeliner, mascara and lip balm and you're gonna be breaking hearts 😍"

21968,I,N,F,J,"Like the short hair, lose the facial hair and add a smile. 👍🏻"
21969,I,N,F,J,"Keep it short. If you are ugly, then what about the majority of people posting here? 🤨 Do they look like hideous to you if you say you are ugly??"
21970,I,N,F,J,"Lose facial hair, please. All of it!"

21972,I,N,F,J,"The clothes and way too big of a cleavage gives me hooker vibes, so dont do that anymore. Dont make yourself look cheap, you are gorgeous already. You have a lovely figure, beautiful eyes, face, hair and everything."
21973,I,N,F,J,You dont have a problem with your looks. You said you had problems in finding the right girl and you were wondering if it was your looks. And I said it isnt that
21974,I,N,F,J,"Cut the hair, lose the facial hair too and you're a 9/10. 
Why on earth are you doing this? Why are you trying your best to hide and look ugly with so much hair. Stop it, atop hiding yourself, its not fair, please."
21975,I,N,F,J,Then you have a personality/approach problem for sure.
21976,I,N,F,J,"Please no roots, pleaseee. Just one single hair color at a time. Take care of your hair, try coconut oil treatment, looks very dry and weak. 
Lovely face, so do use some eyeliner and mascara and some lip balm and you're gonna break some hearts 😍"
21977,I,N,F,J,Your fashion has a drug dealer vibe... Not cool...
21978,I,N,F,J,"Please, please lose the facial hair. Other than that, 8/10👍🏻👍🏻"
21979,I,N,F,J,So you have high standards in women but you look like a 4/10... 😒 🤦
21980,I,N,F,J,"Ok, so you are not ugly, honestly. I saw ugly! Aka girls looking like men, you could swear they were men undercover or something. 
So, you should solve your acneea. (For example using lemon juice, you can find instructions on the internet.)
I love your hair, long and looks good, not frizzy. That is a big plus. 
Now, one thing you can easily solve: please use some eyeliner, its not such a big deal once you get the hang of it, mascara, shape your eyebrows just a little bit and lip balm cuz you have a lovely lip color and we dont wanna lose that.
Once you do these things and also leave your hair long and loose or trying some hairstyles in which you dont put your hair in a bun and hide its beauty, you will look gorgeous.
🤗🤗"
21981,I,N,F,J,"Please, lose the beard! You can keep the moustache for now, but you gotta lose the beard!
You didnt get a date also because of the way you act around girls you want to date. Dont be shy, make the first step. It is nice to be funny but not too childish cuz you are a grown up man now and girls want to date a responsible person that knows what he says and cares about what is going on."
21982,I,N,F,J,You are acting and writing like a movie star that tries to be modest but isnt. Maybe that is killing your matches. You are such an ESFP (MBTI type) - look it up
21983,I,N,F,J,"You are gorgeous, but....the roots 😨 please, I beg of you, have just one hair color, its too big of a shame to spoil your beauty with that. You have perfect skin, amazing eyes and beautiful face and figure overall. 😍"
21984,I,N,F,J,"8/10
Stop panicking when there is no reason to."
21985,I,N,F,J,"😆😆 Yep, lose the moustache. You look hilarious with the moustache as in no one will take your serios. But you are looking good, so dint fear"
21986,I,N,F,J,"I could understand if you wouldnt look drop dead gorgeous, but since you do... I ... I cant understand"

21991,I,N,F,J,Was gonna say the same thing
21992,I,N,F,J,"R u trying really really hard to take the most unfllatering pictures of yourself that you can? 
You look decent, 8/10 but those picture angles are not good!"
21993,I,N,F,J,"First picture 8/10.
The other ones, I'd rather not say. Try and use some decent angles when taking a selfie. The pictures do not do you justice. 
The hairstyle suits you. You look fit, you skin is ok and no facial hair - bravo!"
21994,I,N,F,J,Oh yeah! Give me a remote control that can pause time so that I can have infinite free time just for myself 😻
21995,I,N,F,J,"Software Developer. I dont enjoy it, but its a way of living"
21996,I,N,F,J,"I kind of.... switch between wanting to help everyone/ being nice/tolerate everyone till I get drained and sick of all of it and then I find myself feeling the way you do, then remind myself that, that is not my goal in this life, my goal is to help animals and people as well. That no one is perfect and that I should stop judging other people. God will judge them, that is not my job. My job is to go on the right path in my life and follow God's word. 
And then I do and after a while, slowly but surely I again feel drained and all my compassion fades till there is nothing left but what you described. Then again I have to remind myself of what I just said and also find a way to relax, destress and find my peace: through prayer and other things, such as cuddling my cats till they have had enough and they themselves leave 😄 I dont feel like you described all the time, it comes and goes, it occupies about, I think 10%-20% of how I am and feel in general. The bad thing is I can never totally get rid of it. I sometimes find myself being so harsh that I stop, analyse myself and think: what the heck is wrong with me?! How did I get here? 

So, I suppose you need to find peace, I recommend through prayer cuz nothing is above God, try to relax and do things that relaxes you and interact with as less people as you can. After a while, after this ""detox"" you will slowly but surely feel recovered. Idk how long it would take in your case, but this is the solution. Oh, and I also tidy and clean a lot and organise like crazy when I am super stressed. Seeing everything around me in order makes me feel at peace, it really does. 
I wish you all the best 🤗🤗 take care"
21997,I,N,F,J,"No because I didnt let anyone get close to me. Only my mom whom I trust with my life because she sacrificed everything for me. Other than that, I dont trust anyone. Sure I have friends, but I am always suspicious and never ever let my guard down, never."

22101,I,N,T,J,Same thing could be said with couches/gyms except having a good teacher is 100x better than having some anonymous user giving you questionable advice.
22102,I,N,T,J,wat?!?
22103,I,N,T,J,I prefer a consistent schedule as I could work around it without it changing as opposed to a “retail” schedule.

22106,I,N,T,J,The logistics of going to town and work is too much of a hassle for me.
22107,I,N,T,J,"Now I understand practicing a martial art inspires confidence but the last thing one wants to do in a street fight is get on the ground where others could swarm and stomp you to death and thats the nicest possibility of what could happen, BJJ is a good skill to have but not very useful in real-world life threatening situations."
22108,I,N,T,J,"As a mma practitioner Im sure everyone is going to suggest “learning to fight” but in reality hand to hand combat has its limitations so I would highly suggest mace, taser, or handgun."
22109,I,N,T,J,What does being introverted have to do with anything?
22110,I,N,T,J,Its just internet points that have not value outside of anything why is it cruel?
22111,I,N,T,J,Umm cuz internet points duh
22112,I,N,T,J,Are you asking us?!?!
22113,I,N,T,J,"In all fairness people like that are almost everywhere, that dude behind you at the drive through would probably have no quarrel blowing your head off."
22114,I,N,T,J,Do or do not there is no try.
22115,I,N,T,J,The problem lies within the notion that there is a “one” in reality there is no “the one” we are all beautifully imperfect and human and so when you define or put that label on someone you are almost expecting this individual to “live up to a sort of standard you magically made for this person and so instead of expecting imperfection you are subconsciously expecting perfection and thus you’re immediately destined for disappointment. I know it’s easier said than done but just live in the moment and experience life with that amazing person you got a chance to be with.
22116,I,N,T,J,Yea that’s what we do as well but my first class of kicking each other I was immediately taught how to take less of the kick so I’m not limping all day lol but every gym is different I guess.
22117,I,N,T,J,Isn’t that like the first thing everyone learns before actual sparring? lol you guys just eat kicks all day?

22123,I,N,T,J,"Why management? they barely could run the store, The walmart I used to work at was a constant cluster fuck of mismanagement than again there is no requirements to become a manager at walmart"
22124,I,N,T,J,"Nice, would look better without the decals and have the black trim painted."
22125,I,N,T,J,"I really like it, but in plain yellow or black."
22126,I,N,T,J,What a bunch of posers
22127,I,N,T,J,"you gain nothing by comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to where you once were."
22128,I,N,T,J,"Avoiding the phrase “I don’t have time ..” will soon help you realize that you do have the time needed for just about anything you choose to accomplish in life. I’m poor work 2 jobs with shit hours and make time to eat healthy and go to the gym, just doing these 2 things has reduced my overall stress and I feel great!"

22147,I,N,T,J,"Yep, to be so far your own ass to think, Hey! lets do a gender reveal party! is sad and narcissistic."
22148,I,N,T,J,Right? no capitalization of the beginning of a sentence/statement.
22149,I,N,T,J,Orphan of Kos fight lol.
22150,I,N,T,J,"Did you continue filing the weekly claims or only the initial one? Back in April when I filed initially, I waited for 3 weeks and got nothing and it even said I was “monetarily ineligible” on the site, finally I just filed the weeklies as if I wasn’t and got back paid for all the weeks and continued to until I started working again in July. I never could get through on the phone either."
22151,I,N,T,J,"I learned that my mom is a “narcissistic parent” and simply could not mentally deal with the constant stress, guilt, and walking on eggshells with every interaction. I have no plans on speaking to her again. It’s been one month."

22157,I,N,T,J,He’s already the ceo ;)
22158,I,N,T,J,Or those camping meals! Haha
22159,I,N,T,J,"This is a very common misconception and sucks that so many believe it. Birds in the wild eat seeds and greens/veg. They do not eat grains except when they can’t find anything else. Pellets are man made and processed, even the better brands. Imagine only eating chips and boxed meals all day every day. I free feed seed and pellets, and give greens daily. They only touch the pellets a couple times a week."
22160,I,N,T,J,If they are young it is flight practice/exercise behavior. Gaining strength and muscle
22161,I,N,T,J,"I have the L and XL. Seems like supplier issue, mine both came very fast through chewy and amazon."
22162,I,N,T,J,Remember to not feed pellets solely. They need seeds and greens as well for a balanced diet. Pellets are just grains and vitamins. Similar to dry dog food but for birds.
22163,I,N,T,J,I have 12 birds. This is my life except I don’t think pigeons bite.
22164,I,N,T,J,I’m in Yorktown now in an apartment for 999 a month. I like it but I do have to drive to Newport News for any shopping. This was the only place I could afford that allowed any size dogs. It’s safe here
22165,I,N,T,J,"I was with someone for 4.5 years who wanted kids and marriage while he knew I didn’t want either. And we didn’t even have an “electric” relationship either. It was pretty bad actually. I had to finally end it. Neither of us were happy at all but he would have just stayed if I didn’t end it, for reasons unknown to me. But anyway I think he also thought I would change my mind otherwise he wouldn’t have brought it up every chance he could make a joke about it. Moral of story, I see now that I can’t be with anyone even for a short time if they know that they want those things."
22166,I,N,T,J,I’ve been walking my dog almost every day since march-ish. Sometimes I don’t feel like it but do it anyway and the duck babies and turtles and fresh air (albeit toasty now) help and it ends up usually being nice :)
22167,I,N,T,J,"*Is it necessary for me to drink my own urine? No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste.*"
22168,I,N,T,J,You can order that online??? From where?
22169,I,N,T,J,That is so funny. I wouldn’t even begin to know where to acquire such a specimen but hopefully one day I can try!
22170,I,N,T,J,It’s ok really!
22171,I,N,T,J,I did try that actually. Different times and amounts for 3-4 weeks. I have a fast metabolism so I’m not sure if that affects it or not. /shrug
22172,I,N,T,J,I honestly want to do that just to see how it turns out because I’m a plant person too :’)
22173,I,N,T,J,"Even better, thank you"
22174,I,N,T,J,"I have, yea. The liquid does nothing at all for me so I have vapes but they only work for immediate panic type situations."
22175,I,N,T,J,You can even see all the little died off stems where it flowered too. It’s gonna be so pretty when it flowers again!
22176,I,N,T,J,Very sorry :( I have had to put down 2 dogs so I know exactly how that is. Time helps but you won’t forget about them. It’ll be ok and don’t feel bad about getting another. They need us!
22177,I,N,T,J,Really jealous of everyone who has weed or is in a legal state.
22178,I,N,T,J,"Oh my gosh thank you haha I’ve been fighting with super oily skin this summer but I know a lot of people have it way worse so I’m still thankful! I’ve never had actual acne but when I found out I was gluten intolerant and cut all wheat out, I stopped getting random pimples. Bodies are weird. Anyway, you are that strong regardless of what you think :)"
22179,I,N,T,J,Well I’m sorry that was the case for you and I’m glad you’re better off too :)
22180,I,N,T,J,"I know, I’m not even a hugger for real but every once in a while I will let it happen haha"
22181,I,N,T,J,"I think the bird groups will be just fine without me. They can keep fighting over perches and proper cage size ;P

Thank you, that really means a lot <3"
22182,I,N,T,J,"You know what, I realized after that I probably spelled that wrong but was too foggy still at that moment so I didn’t care. Dang! I hate misspellings!! Also thank you :)"
22183,I,N,T,J,Biggest thank you :))
22184,I,N,T,J,"I really hope so, thank you. It’s been quite a journey."
22185,I,N,T,J,Thank you.. means a lot
22186,I,N,T,J,"That is so nice, thank you. So far the world doesn’t really know I exist but I want to try and change that :)"
22187,I,N,T,J,"That is so sweet! No pun intended. I want cake so bad but gluten intolerance has made me its bitch. I would do some things for a Costco muffin right about now. Anyway getting off track, thank you!!"
22188,I,N,T,J,"Thank you so much, have made a lot of changes that I didn’t mention as well, but I know I have way more to do and learn still. I appreciate it :)"
22189,I,N,T,J,"Yay, love ya :)"
22190,I,N,T,J,It’s honestly terrifying but I feel more content now than I ever did before
22191,I,N,T,J,Thanks so much. I honestly never ask for support so I almost didn’t say anything! But you guys are seriously so nice I can’t stand it
22192,I,N,T,J,Thank you :’))) ugh
22193,I,N,T,J,*enjoyyyysss*
22194,I,N,T,J,<333 sometimes there is so much to say that I can’t think of anything
22195,I,N,T,J,"Thank you, I hope so"
22196,I,N,T,J,"I appreciate this so much, thank you <3"
22197,I,N,T,J,:) you’re the best
22198,I,N,T,J,Thank you! I still feel a little guilty but hoping it will pass
22199,I,N,T,J,"I really hope so, thank you"
22200,E,S,F,P,"You can do it for sure but as someone who’s been practicing for almost two years it’s going to take you close to five years to get anywhere moderately advanced unless you get a vocal coach or have natural talent in terms of quick development and then you might be able to knock it down to 3 or 4 years. It’s like any other muscle to strengthen; a language and instrument to learn. It’s fun at times and frustrating as hell at times but for every time you hear ‘wow, you have a nice voice’ it’s enough to keep you going. It’s so much better, too, if your S/O or close friend is in on helping you improve. And if you have a good space to forget the world and use your voice to its fullest extent. 

In the end, if this is something your passionate about and are able to stick with it and practice consistently (don’t forget to take breaks though), you will absolutely see improvement if you are working your voice in a non-destructive way."

22213,E,S,F,P,"There’s a point where this breaks down, when you get people (primarily millennial white girls, but I understand that’s generalizing) trying to be the protector, guardian, and mouthpiece of a minority, instead denying said minority their independence by implying that the minority needs help from a member of the majority because they can’t do it on their own, regardless of whether or not that help was asked for."
22214,E,S,F,P,My fiancé and I watched the highlights and we were just laughing this sad and cynical form of laughter sprouting from a deep-seated feeling of futility. This years election is heartbreakingly pointless.
22215,E,S,F,P,"Daily life has pretty much gone back to normal. For the few days after coming to work I was a little anxious I might still be spreading it and I was worried that if people knew I had contracted it they would avoid me like... well, the plague.

Super picky, avoidant of things she doesn’t like, has no ability to face her fears/stresses on her own. 

Then there’s Me, being a 4w5, wanting to constantly push her toward facing her irrational fears that she knows very well are indeed irrational, but she still resists."
22219,E,S,F,P,At this point I’m pretty certain America is still going to be a lost cause until Gen X and maybe even the older millennials retire and/or die out. I’d get my hopes up about American politics maybe MAYBE in the 2040s-2060s but for now we’re going to be fucked over every time

22239,E,S,F,P,People who don’t know the difference between Teal (my favorite color) and fucking cyan (which that is) so I at least give them credit for not saying teal
22240,E,S,F,P,Where’d you get the 3% statistic?
22241,E,S,F,P,I feel that. Like I can imagine having an interest in manipulating corporate policy but I would be done the moment someone caught on. To go that far as to try again multiple times is just kinda... lacking in rational thought

22300,I,N,T,P,"Just have it be an option so everyone is happy. If you want to play with NPCs forever go ahead. But online increases longevity, and if it's optional then who cares just play your story mode"
22301,I,N,T,P,"Just have online separate from single player and boom everyone is happy. I don't understand why people don't want to meet new people in hogwarts, which would make the game feel alive instead of NPCs, have quidditch tournaments/ matchmaking, explore with friends, and duel! It gives the game more longevity after you played all the houses 100 times. And people gotta stop coming every online to gta. It's not all like that."
22302,I,N,T,P,But the single player mode would be done... You have an optional feature.
22303,I,N,T,P,"Just have it be optional so you can have fun with your NPCs. online also helps with longevity. When I play like harry potter servers on minecraft it's so alive with lots of players, imagine meetings in your houses with real players. Online dueling clubs, quidditch matchmaking systems, It would be sick. And if optional it's a win win. Don't see the complaining really."
22304,I,N,T,P,Because I want to meet new people and have it be OPTIONAL so for some baffling reason others don't want to duel others or hangout in common rooms and such and make new friends.
22305,I,N,T,P,Yep I did this too and saved bank
22306,I,N,T,P,Sold my quest for $300 yesterday
22307,I,N,T,P,That's why I said I HOPE. As in in ADDITION.
22308,I,N,T,P,Can't wait I hope they add a multiplay area so I can hang out with friends from other houses and quidditch :D
22309,I,N,T,P,This was really good!!! I tried it out and it was easy and enjoyable :)
22310,I,N,T,P,"It's tough because I don't like to cook, and my dad won't get freshly where it's just natural foods and you just heat it up... Also I just have been feeling low energy latley and tired. So it makes doing walking and stuff unfulfilling. I just wanna be less lazy and eat healthier. Another thing is I just wanna feel full, sometimes after eating a meal. Ex. Chicken breast and fries and beans, I'll be back 5 minutes later after eating and quickly which also leads to heartburn."
22311,I,N,T,P,Who could of seen that coming shocker. glad I'm home with my refund chillin
22312,I,N,T,P,"I have Ms. Reynolds. But like I have had a history of having problems with math ever since middle school and have struggled all the way to the end of my time at community college leading me to drop stats and fail a quantitative literacy class.. I have had an awful relationship and with ADHD on top of that it's impossible and frustrating and having a dad who is great at math tell you ""you learned this in middle school"" over and over leads to learned helplessness. I'm great in other subjects but I can't get behind or vibe with math. I've done everything under the sun to try and help myself. Granted atleast I don't have to take calc."
22313,I,N,T,P,How do you take classes at other colleges online?
22314,I,N,T,P,What accomodations do you think I could get besides more time?
22315,I,N,T,P,My major is Psychology and it's college algebra that's required
22316,I,N,T,P,No like I have ADHD and I am pretty sure I have dyscalculia. And I did this math thing over the summer so I could get in MAT 111. But I kinda skirted it.. because I wanted to quickly get into 111.
22317,I,N,T,P,Luckily I got a full refund :) I'm back home now
22318,I,N,T,P,"Awful, being apart of the UNC school system in NC is very bad. They won't give refunds in case of closing. Luckily I got out of my housing contract."
22319,I,N,T,P,I got out of my housing contract so I'm good now :)
22320,I,N,T,P,What about dorms?
22321,I,N,T,P,No single rooms at all?
22322,I,N,T,P,"Common space, but I also have asthma issues and just don't vibe with my roommates I'd like to get a solo room if possible Idc where. Just getting kinda panicky"
22323,I,N,T,P,How do I find someone who would want to move out?
22324,I,N,T,P,Yeah but I don't want 3 other roomates
22325,I,N,T,P,Is this game hard?
22326,I,N,T,P,I assume you get a lot of hours out of it I hope?
22327,I,N,T,P,Is it difficult?
22328,I,N,T,P,Any really fun games that seems to have hours of content? An RPG style game would be great
22329,I,N,T,P,Any additive games?
22330,I,N,T,P,Any good get recommendations that have good replayability?
22331,I,N,T,P,"No I haven't, is it fun?"
22332,I,N,T,P,"Any good hidden gems that have a lot of replayability? I already have Diablo, AC, and slay the spire."
22333,I,N,T,P,Never played any of them
22334,I,N,T,P,Doesn't always mean racist tho could just have southern pride.
22335,I,N,T,P,Just don't buy it then 🤷‍♂️
22336,I,N,T,P,Any good  Salicylic acid products? Preferably on Amazon?
22337,I,N,T,P,Yeah my skin is darker but I just want sunscreen so I don't get darker and what should I use for dark spots and small bumps?
22338,I,N,T,P,Is the L'Oreal one bad? It seems to do quite a lot
22339,I,N,T,P,Any good skincare products for men with light oily skin? (I think my skin is more on the oily side but I don't really have any acne anymore just very time bumps that you can only see when viewed up close.
22340,I,N,T,P,Idk why people think a Twitter mob is the majority
22341,I,N,T,P,"Exactly this, I don't know why people can't understand that this in addition to a single player mode would make both people happy. NPCs are ok and all but I wanna connect with new people and hang out in the common room."
22342,I,N,T,P,But again what do you expect to do when you bet the game?
22343,I,N,T,P,That's why I said in addition
22344,I,N,T,P,"Uh I choose my house which is Ravenclaw, I don't like that people label houses as popular. I feel it should align with your personality type instead of choosing a house just because."
22345,I,N,T,P,"Hello, I am a male with a darker complexion looking to see if there are any products to lighten my skin pigmentation. I usually do not put anything on my skin so I'm not sure where to start exactly. I would want to look lighter from head to toe."
22346,I,N,T,P,User?
22347,I,N,T,P,Hey I'm an incoming transfer (sophmore) my discord is: Distorted#5433
22348,I,N,T,P,What is power score
22349,I,N,T,P,If black lives really mattered then people would be protesting around black communities as blacks kill more blacks than whites kill blacks. But no one says anything when a black kills another. Only when a white cop does. So hypocritical.
22350,I,N,T,P,Thank you Alex!
22351,I,N,T,P,"Okay, ty"
22352,I,N,T,P,"I wasn’t the one who screwed it up first, so oh well."
22353,I,N,T,P,"I don’t want hope, I just want to know what to do from here on out."
22354,I,N,T,P,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
22355,I,N,T,P,"I really hope he is going to be okay, especially given that he wasn’t even supposed to stay this long..."
22356,I,N,T,P,Hi
22357,I,N,T,P,"Same. I’m down to be a cult leader, though... It sounds like a fun gig."
22358,I,N,T,P,Hahaha
22359,I,N,T,P,"Eh, ISTJ can be boring AF"
22360,I,N,T,P,Finally lol
22361,I,N,T,P,That sounds normal to me
22362,I,N,T,P,Interesting
22363,I,N,T,P,Interesting. Have you ever had a romantic experience with a guy that makes you think you are bisexual or are you unsure?
22364,I,N,T,P,"I want a sexuality distribution of the types I’m interested in pursuing. I want to see the likeliness or meeting someone of that particular type who has the potential to be interested in me (gay male). Most subreddits have the gender distributions so I just apply those percentages to the sexualities. Of course I’d prefer to ask for gender and sexuality together to get a more accurate measurement... and on multiple sites, not just Reddit, but that would make the process more complicated... so it’s sufficient enough for me."
22365,I,N,T,P,The first statement is a moral fact of sorts but the latter is very debatable...
22366,I,N,T,P,This is excessively gross... I could not live there...
22367,I,N,T,P,B
22368,I,N,T,P,"It’s all right lol, hard to keep up with all the new menial tasks as someone with ADHD... it’s kind of sad... but I do like the learning format of online learning far more than offline due to the fact that I went to an online high school."
22369,I,N,T,P,Tallanasty
22370,I,N,T,P,I don’t want to be discouraging but it would be a bit odd.
22371,I,N,T,P,"Meh, that was me with the summer classes. Not anymore, shit doesn’t affect me these days."
22372,I,N,T,P,"There is but only for classes outside of your major (& minor?) requirements, AKA elective courses."
22373,I,N,T,P,Same lol
22374,I,N,T,P,I’ll believe you.
22375,I,N,T,P,"I’ve always wanted to live in France, and not having to do anything for the rest of my life if I VERY intensely dedicate myself to a single pursuit sounds awesome. It’s basically my goal. So, yeah... option 2. Plus, I did the repressed emotions thing already, didn’t go well at all..."
22376,I,N,T,P,Are we just fine...?
22377,I,N,T,P,I do this all the time. Sometimes I speak out loud as well... very awkward.
22378,I,N,T,P,"Hahaha. As an INTP who always invites my good friend who is an ENTP out to do homework, this is pretty accurate."
22379,I,N,T,P,Agreed!
22380,I,N,T,P,The apes that evolved from Floridians are modern day Floridians (this comes from someone in FL).
22381,I,N,T,P,Same here!
22382,I,N,T,P,What the fuck did they EXPECT LMAO
22383,I,N,T,P,"Been there, done that."
22384,I,N,T,P,This is a beautiful story.
22385,I,N,T,P,Fantastic!
22386,I,N,T,P,"Uhhh you should tell people before you disappear and then tell them the truth behind how you get easily socially exhausted but it isn’t a personal thing. I am an INTP and it works for me. I have known a few INFJs who disappear and when they don’t tell me I usually think it is something personal but as soon as I ask them and they remain honest then I tell them, okay, thanks for telling me! I wish they had told me before, however, because it really hurts when we get close and then I think they don’t want me around."
22387,I,N,T,P,Very nice sketch here. Skilled.
22388,I,N,T,P,"Awesome, thanks."
22389,I,N,T,P,Thank you!
22390,I,N,T,P,I already have it from calculus I-II but thank you for your offer.
22391,I,N,T,P,Thank you. Which chapters?
22392,I,N,T,P,My entire life in 1 meme
22393,I,N,T,P,Don’t. Just don’t. Lol
22394,I,N,T,P,"Is it racist to say “I hate black people” if they’re black? 

A lot of people would say yes, especially given the current climate. I would as well. Therefore I would say the same for any race that is saying that of their own race."
22395,I,N,T,P,INTJ
22396,I,N,T,P,"Woah, what a glow up."
22397,I,N,T,P,"I think meeting a truly healthy INTP would change this mindset in a positive direction but I do understand your perspective. I do agree, however, that even for myself as well as other healthy INTPs there is a degree of undetected sensitivity that permeates our lives. As for myself, I have been working on my awareness of this fact but it nevertheless is uncomfortable for me to consistently acknowledge. That is one of the reasons why I love talking to INFJs, they have taught me that emotions are okay to experience and something which can even enhance life. I am always quite thankful for their tolerance of my fumbling nature, haha."
22398,I,N,T,P,and the INTPs who are emotionally mature?
22399,I,N,T,P,*Engineer lol
22400,I,S,F,P,"For me. I have no problem showing my vulnerable side. Even to friends or strangers, I have nothing to feel my vulnerable side or even my dark side need to be hide. (Of course, I wont share my personal life around too, just say ""shy to show that side to other people"" is not the reason.) 

If someone I like told me she/he likes me too. I dont think I can hide how happy I am, like I probably told her to hang on a sec and run away just to scream and quickly come back. 

The only reason I would avoid to face her in person is because I'm not ready to lie."
22401,I,S,F,P,3-4 or 10++ so I could camouflage myself in crowds.
22402,I,S,F,P,When they pull out knife from injured character. We all know it's more dangerous and they still do it in movie/tv. Annoying as fuck.
22403,I,S,F,P,Ppl who go there must be fine with it in the first hand? Going to swing club with your couple means both can have fun there. I guess ppl there must be very open though.
22404,I,S,F,P,I dont think I'm sarcastic but other people say I'm sarcastic especially when I was telling truth from my heart. I doubt that ISTP would get this a lot more than us.
22405,I,S,F,P,Ppl who tried to force me to do what they think it's good for me. Like my cousins want me to pray or go to church because they mean good to me. I believe they mean good to me but I just hate it so much.
22406,I,S,F,P,"There was the time me and my friends had one day trip in old town. When we came back to the car after walking around for whole day and visited many places. My friend said he lost his wallet. He told me he put his wallet in the plastic bag that he got from buying fruits from market but now the wallet was gone. 

I told him. ""I didnt see it in your bag since when we were in that church and you left the bag on the bench to take your mobile phone out and scan QR code at the wall for church information."" 

I think it's S user. We remember things in exacted way while N user remember things with mood and tone."
22407,I,S,F,P,"
If my love wants to do something with his life like he wants to eat healthier, I would be 100% support him. Just skip food we usually had together is totally fine for me. (Or I might have donuts for my own and find another activities, places to hang out with him) also it's totally fine if he wants to stay diet but when he has cheat meal/day, he wants to spend it on something else but not donuts. I would be totally fine with that. If I want to be with him, I might just drive around and stuck in traffic with him, order some food and watch movie together in his/your place, or just video call or voice call for all day is also fine. 

The most important thing is not to have donuts but to have quality time together."
22408,I,S,F,P,Agree to this.
22409,I,S,F,P,I'm ISFP and I'm pretty sure I'm 5 but I dont know which wing. ISFP enneagram 5 does exist. Lol
22410,I,S,F,P,"I'm indoor person and I live in city. I watch nature documentaries and feel ""um...ok"" (while my INFJ friend is very into it...) 

But I enjoy nature in the way that all of me Se were activated by it. Hiking/ treking, climbing mountain. And feel the wind , here the voices, smell all scents , use your eyes, also you have to be sharp almost all the time to check with the map and compass. Activate all Se alone and feel how so little I am compared with the whole circle of life. To think this way, is how I enjoy nature."
22411,I,S,F,P,"Yep. Isfp pretty accurate. I would be like, why the hell you still text me? Go take shower."
22412,I,S,F,P,"My mom is ENFP. My father is ESFP. My older brother is ENFJ. 

Tbh, I'm pretty struggle in my own house. My father is a free bird, he thinks of himself first. My mom would say he's selfish but I somehow understand him. He approaches me when he wants and left us when he feels uncomfortable. He never be around when anyone in family has uncomfortable feeling. He will avoid facing it. 

My ENFJ brother tries to gather everyone together. He tries to find good reasons why we should stick together. I'm not sure if he really mean it or he just ""tries"" because he wants to make family complete. I hate it when he tried to force everyone to be kind to another even when they dislike each other. I feel like he just wants to see people be kind to another for himself to feel good but he never ask what other people think.

My mom is ENFP. She always complains on literally everything like her life sucks since married her husband. She's good at playing victim and blame everybody else. She's the most indecisive person I ever known, she would ask for everyone's opinion and if anything bad happens, she would say ""it's her/his idea to do this but I dont blame her/him."" 

Fucking chaos and that's why I just want to be alone for almost all the time."
22413,I,S,F,P,"I need deadline to drive me to work. I know if I dont have deadline my work would never be done so I love to work with deadline.

I don't really care about critic. There's stereotype that ISFPs cant stand critic, I just don't take it personal."
22414,I,S,F,P,Agree to this.
22415,I,S,F,P,I'm isfp. I'm illustrator and also writer. Not sure how and when Ne works with me but I really want to have it. I actually just wanna be INFP lol.
22416,I,S,F,P,Like what? Just wondering because Te is my inferior.
22417,I,S,F,P,Something weird happens inside their brain and N users around me always suck at sports and movement and bad at driving. I know not all of N users will be like that but just saying mostly N uses around me.
22418,I,S,F,P,"Idk what Fe do but for me, I just easily imagine myself in that situation and feel for them. That's why I hate it so much if someone says ""I feel you"" but do nothing."
22419,I,S,F,P,Infp?
22420,I,S,F,P,I cant wait!!!  None of contents in apple tv + interested me until I bought ipad recently and I got free trial for 1 year. Now The morning show will be my only reason to keep renew the subscription.
22421,I,S,F,P,Wow 5 more than I thought! I thought I'm the only one who close to ISTP dudes.
22422,I,S,F,P,"I have read it many sites telling to engage more Se. I didnt really understand how it would work since it sounds like, ""oh you're stress? Go exercise or sport the "" which sounds stupid and avoid the problems to me. Until 2 months ago, I was stressed so much and I decided to go camping alone on the mountain that has the base camp but no electricity nor tap water. I wasnt a camping person, never own a tent or a sleeping bag. I climbed up the mountain for 8 hours alone (not like literally alone since I met some campers along the way but yeah...) I stayed there for 3 days. Came down forgetting what I depressed about. 

I guess engaging Se means something like this.  Use your sensing but be with yourself at the same time."
22423,I,S,F,P,"I would say, do anything you want but set some rules to limit yourself not get out of the track. Like when I'm on big project, I still go have fun time, watch movie, hang out with my friends, but my work need to progress as what I planned on schedule too."
22424,I,S,F,P,You are not a racist and werent a racist. You were ignorant but it's fine since you are not one now.
22425,I,S,F,P,Last hole in the band would be fine. (I'm 17-18 cm and I wear it on third hole from the last.)
22426,I,S,F,P,"I'm Asian and I know there're some racist toward each other among us but not sure about ""extremely racist"" though. I just know some Japanese/Korean/Chinese racist since they have bad history in the past and I understand why they still hate each others until now, at least there's a reason. 

What I always dont understand for real is when people around the world just hate or against each other for their different of skin or believes such as white vs black or christian vs Muslim. That makes no sense for me at all. I never understand why black people couldnt have education (in old days, I mean) at the first place."
22427,I,S,F,P,"Art, chil, caring but selfish, animals, travel , ""you wouldnt get it"" but the rest are meh..."
22428,I,S,F,P,"Im using miband 5 now and I have read/watched some miband4 reviews. I think anyone who has 4 doesnt have to upgrade to 5 even it's not that expensive but it's not that worth to move from 4 to 5. But if you never have anyband before, this one is good one to start with. I find a few problems (fail to sync data few times after my cycling trip was quite bum, but again...the price is cheap so I dont expect much.)"
22429,I,S,F,P,"They collected students' finger prints so Jacob's finger print was matched with the finger print on the knife. Plus, Ben sounds like a dick to everyone but Jacob's friend (cant remember the name) heard Jacob said something like ""Ben deserved to die"" so the kid connected the dots and gave this info to officers. All evidences pointed to Jacob rather than anyone else in school."
22430,I,S,F,P,There's original Mi band (price will be a little bit higher than knock off but still cheap) it will come with decent package and logo. I guess that one's quality would be the same.
22431,I,S,F,P,"To be honest, she never stopped being Rachel  to me until this show. She really makes me believe she's the woman who has got benefit from her job so long that it made her becomes ignorance and silent to toxic environment at work place."
22432,I,S,F,P,"She just fell into what her career gave her, she obviously has heart and feelings inside which has shown clearly in the finale episode."
22433,I,S,F,P,Depends on how mature they (you and her) are.
22434,I,S,F,P,"Temporary job for us should be contemporary job such as performer (music/ acting/etc.) or art stuff that you can change the details everytime you start new project but it's still in same field. 

Contemporary job for me is something that suppose to be temporary job for others because we cant stand routine too much, we should go do it just to learn something and left when it fulfill you enough. For me, those kind of routine jobs but contact with ppl such as teaching would be good for us if you do it for short time. Like 1-2 years."
22435,I,S,F,P,"Relatable. I do have close friends that I would be so sad if one day we're not friends anymore but at the end of the day, I still dream about living in a world without any human anyway."
22436,I,S,F,P,Thanks! I have same problem until I found your comment! Lol
22437,I,S,F,P,I have reached 165 BPM on cycling. I wear it left hand though.
22438,I,S,F,P,"First page (home) > view more > there are 2 menu on the top of screen, chose ""work out"" and this stat will show in the bottom of all."
22439,I,S,F,P,Wow thank you so much. I purchased mi band 5 today and I havent download any watchface yet since it's so variety there! Thanks so much!
22440,I,S,F,P,"Me too. In Mi fit it shows ""how to sync with Health"" means that it hasnt sync with Health yet. So confuse since I have checked in Health app and it shows that Health already use data from MiFit already."
22441,I,S,F,P,Hi do you still have problem? I just purchase mi band 5 and wonder how can I activate this function too.
22442,I,S,F,P,"I dont really concern how other people expect me to be. I mean, I dont even know if they were impressed by me or expect anything about me. They might or might not but I dont really think about it. And what I feel lucky is that I rarely know xxTJ, I actually have met only one guy who is my friend's husband. I can feel the arrogant and cockiness in his eyes, good point is that he thinks he smarter and more success than me sooo much that he spares me, not challenge or try to debate with me because he thinks I'm not in the same league with him (which is so cool since I dont have anything to talk with him anyway)"
22443,I,S,F,P,I have share this with few of my close friends who I think they accomplish even more than me. 😂
22444,I,S,F,P,Thanks man. I shared this with few of my close friends already :)
22445,I,S,F,P,I've got istp but I think I'm isfp. It's pretty close though. I used to mistype myself as istp too.
22446,I,S,F,P,"5 , not know my wing."
22447,I,S,F,P,Congrats man!! I hope you enjoy the university life.
22448,I,S,F,P,"Yes. I felt like I tried so hard to fit in when I was in highschool and college. Lack of balance between go with the flow and has standing ground. 

Now I'm 32. My high school friends got back together and I feel like at this age. I know how to lay back and my friends are (mentally) old enough to have deep convo together. We seeing each other even more often than when we were young."
22449,I,S,F,P,My mom. It's fucking tired. She's manipulated person and always play victim. Too emotional to handle.
22450,E,N,F,P,What series is this?
22451,E,N,F,P,Would love to. Count me in
22452,E,N,F,P,B-but! Ohh ok...
22453,E,N,F,P,"Everyone(including muah): OMG THIS IS SO CUTE!

Me: What's the buttons on INTJ sweater vest is for?"
22454,E,N,F,P,Awww the enfp looks adorable. Would love to see her more
22455,E,N,F,P,Is that a brat I sense?
22456,E,N,F,P,Am unattractive woman who's very uhhh.... Sexually available and active
22457,E,N,F,P,Yeah! Shout out to all the ISTJs. You guys are very cool
22458,E,N,F,P,Yeah we ENFP really have problems with ghosting or keeping in touch for a really long time. Mine stem from the inability to say that I don't really 'click' with them but can't say it outright
22459,E,N,F,P,Yeah how DARE the writer write a realistic and tragically relatable display of shock and emotionally shutting down. And how dare they write the rare representation of male abuse victim and even rarer emotional abuse male victim who is a MINOR
22460,E,N,F,P,This is so cool! If you don't mind. Is there other social media sites you post your art?

22532,E,N,T,J,"I've played both Titanfall and Titanfall 2, and even though years have passed since I played the first, I'll never forget how unique and suspenseful the campaign was. It had great writing and immersive characters. Titanfall 2's writing is worse but the unique level design is superb, I don't think two levels are ever the same, the atmosphere is still relatively immersive and the relationship between Cooper and BT is justifiably everybody's favorite thing about the campaign. What it lacked in writing, it brought back in fun level design, funny dialogue, immersive gameplay and an expected but still emotional ending. Not to mention the *amazing* last level, especially when the 6-4 come in."

22576,I,N,F,P,Damn bruh 😳
22577,I,N,F,P,I agree! Actually all men and women who are confident are desired and even loved more! When INFP men are confident tho they can be much more loved because of their caring personality even though they might be viewed as weak by their peers but... I think women love them much more let's be honest 🥺. I also think INFPs when they're mature are the least weak especially emotionally they're actually strong in that sense

22600,I,S,F,J,throwback to my first day at my first ever job where I kept calling my older coworker by the wrong name until she said “by the way my name is not xx it’s yy” I was so embarrassed
22601,I,S,F,J,uhm america has a history of forced sterilization on WOC not just the recent events at the detention centers
22602,I,S,F,J,I don’t know if you mean the last line and that scares me
22603,I,S,F,J,you were talking about it to compare those two things (I’m against all forced sterilization ofc) but I’m just saying that they’re ALREADY doing it to women like no reason to compare it to tying tubes.
22604,I,S,F,J,yeah dude it’s not like america has a history of forced hysterectomies- oh
22605,I,S,F,J,"Taylor won an award, and Kanye went up on stage to say that Beyoncé deserved that award. Funny he thinks he made her famous, when she was the one winning a vma for best female video."

22607,I,S,F,J,omg same and I’m embarrassed to say that I didn’t see anything wrong w it bc I think the elite/politicians puts people up against eachother so you’ll be mad at the poor people receiving $1200 while the ultra rich get away with only payin $750 in taxes. Where’s my tin foil hat
22608,I,S,F,J,"Another thing that’s also funny is that when people talk about diversity and representation none of them takes it seriously, but now it’s suddenly important? Hmm"
22609,I,S,F,J,i mean Riley from inside out showed that parents don’t always know what’s going on in their kids’ heads that doesn’t necessarily make them bad parents just more realistic

22615,I,S,F,J,love the carpet!
22616,I,S,F,J,this is actually something we learned in psychology. When the child has a good support system they will start exploring the “world” like walk around in the room/outside knowing they have their parents behind them if something bad happens. They’re also easier to comfort and can be easily comforted by strangers too.
22617,I,S,F,J,yeah ofc it depends on if they did it then in Vegas but I mean they probably did

22629,I,S,F,J,"which is a weird way to think for several reasons. If he thinks breastfeeding is sexual, and he thinks it’s ok for his son to be breastfed, he is essentially saying it’s ok for his wife and son to be doing something sexual?"
22630,I,S,F,J,"I did that too! But imagine my surprise when they talked about a dead character, every time something happened I would just wait for that character to get hurt. My friends hate spoilers, but i love them - especially movie/tv show spoilers."

22638,I,S,F,J,"They already know the answer themselves, but they have to ask advice from their echo chamber"
22639,I,S,F,J,luckily daddy is an army medic so he knows a lot about hurt BABIES...
22640,I,S,F,J,Emma Chamberlain has left the chat?? I guess? Her whole personality is based on not showering and burping in all her videoes..
22641,I,S,F,J,"honestly couldn’t agree more, and when he’s calling them out they’ve got the audacity to say that he’s the one in the wrong! Where I’m from they’ve also got that whole “respect your elders” and “your future wife have to do this and that and look like this and that” totally wrong of them"
22642,I,S,F,J,"also the fact that they weren’t just disrespectful to her, they were also incredibly disrespectful to OP too. Why would they even think it was ok?"
22643,I,S,F,J,can she even afford a lawsuit...
22644,I,S,F,J,I saw that thread and the pics too!
22645,I,S,F,J,Ofc the Germans have a word for it

22671,I,N,T,P,I still have the geotechnical engineering book to complete.
22672,I,N,T,P,So what do you mean when you say male?  What do you actually experience as gender? Is it based on instincts? Or social norms? What do you feel exactly?
22673,I,N,T,P,"I've been mistaken for a woman(because of my long hair and lack of facial hair) and I go as a man(unless I'm cosplaying). I don't mind being any of them. I just think gender is more connected with personal myths and I think my myth is gender neutral, probably. Or I'm just totally oblivious to emotions."

22681,I,N,T,P,"You won't bleed when you wax though. I've also dislocated my shoulder and it hurts like hell(especially hey they put it back in the socket) but a lot of people do that. Pulling someone hair of is not something normal people would do. It's just unnatural and I perceive it to have an exponential increase in pain as the more closer your hair disconnects, unlike waxing which is more of an instantaneous sensation.

22720,I,N,T,P,">you hit a hard inflection point on the V/F curve

With increased voltage you can manage to move electrons faster with higher electric filed (actually up to a point, after that the added dynamic capacitance decreases speed) and the latency for the circuit decreases, so we can have higher clocks. And that is the critical frequency if not limited by temp/power. At each voltage point, the instability frequency is exactly inverse of the critical path latency. No matter what the power draw is (a boosted single core uses around 30-40 w, that's not a lot)

>If instead the architectural limitations where the main limiter then you would instead see much more similar behavior between dies independent of silicon quality.

The truth is actually the other way. Only if the limitation was due to the power envelope, we would get more consistent results from different silicons (which is the case for out-of-the-box zen all core turbo) but when we get closer to the edge, any small imperfection in the silicon can affect the critical path and then the maximum stable frequency. That's why different chips overclock differently, and it's because of the critical path which is determined by both architecture and fabrication node.

>the node that Zen 2 is on just has a VERY steep V/F curve

The zen frequency characteristic I mentioned was the same for zen/zen+/zen2 all based on different nodes. The thing is they all have critical path checkers.

>Intel's 14nm has a less steep curve, you still see some scaling at higher power but efficiency goes out the door

Intel's architecture has a lower critical path latency by design. The frequency ceiling is higher than zen. (Which is both a good and bad thing). There is a difference between what frequency can you get, and what frequency you want to get. In Intel you can get 5.3 GHz if you want, but that needs a lot of power. In single core though you can handle that power and push that freq. In zen, say 4.4 GHz is both what you can and want to get.

>the physical limitations of the NODE are setting the limits these days, NOT ARCHITECTURE. If you design something to be capable of X but another factor stops you at 0,75X you will for all intents and purposes only reach the same goal as something designed for 0,75X to begin with.

Physical limitation of current nodes are above 10 GHz, but no one wants that because it's inefficient. So everyone designs their architecture for reasonable frequencies with less pipeline stages (that's a tradeoff). Also less pipeline stages is easier to handle in branch prediction thus the IPC increases. If there was an architectural advantage in higher pipeline stages, designers would go for it, and limit the clocks manually.

Another example: ARM cortex A55 aims for clocks around 1 GHz because they want super short pipelines (5 stages) for lower branch misprediction penalty. So this cortex has relatively high IPC in 1GHz with minimal circuits, but it can't do higher frequencies, no matter how much power you push to it or which node you are at.

Designing the pipeline is all about the frequencies you ""want"" while maintaining the minimum stages possible so you can control it easier. Increasing the stages above some point though has no advantage because you can't use that frequency anyway (story of netburst ...)

>If you design something to be capable of X but another factor stops you at 0,75X you will for all intents and purposes only reach the same goal as something designed for 0,75X to begin with.

This is exactly the reason they don't aim for higher frequencies in their architecture designs. They aim for a frequency that you can hit if you want. (Zen precision boost story ...) and IPC is easier. Win-win."

22722,I,N,T,P,">theoretical ceilings are not interesting for actual products.

Actually architectures after Prescott have lower clock ceilings by design and they can hit that with a bit of overclocking. On the other side, Zen architecture for example has internal critical path checkers right in the silicon, and determines the max clock based on that, even if there is thermal and power headroom left, and that clock is not a crazy unobtainable number because it's designed that way. 4.7 is the theoretical and practical clock ceiling for ryzen 3950x and it actually uses that in real world.

>your claim was that a larger core would clock worse

22723,I,N,T,P,"I have already deleted my post to stop spreading false information. But only for the sake of reply:

>why Netburst and BD failed

They stopped because of very high power usage, and they never touched their clock ceiling. But under liquid helium, the world record for highest clock is still for fx-9590 (I know that's besides the point!)

>SB clocks substantially better than Westmere

sandy bridged was definitely a better architecture with better latency, otherwise how could it clock higher than westmere on the same 32 nm node, based on what you said here:
>clocks only improved marginally across the node lifetime

The 30 stage pipeline in netburst prescott was designed for 7GHz+ (which was impossible because of power usage) and the architecture at that point had nothing to do with the end product's clock. but nehalem, sandy bridge, penryn and all other architectures targeted reasonable clocks, and that has effect on the final product (as well as node itself, power, voltages, ...)

sandy bridge was a very big architecture change, but later architectures are more or less incremental improvements (sandy bridge, haswell and skylake all have the same 14 cycle pipeline.) so if this ends up to be the same for the willow cove, and it is on the same 14 nm node, all the variables are equal, so other parameters can lead into difference (even small)."

The max frequency heavily relies on pipeline length, and both sandy bridge and nehalem were big architecture overhauls with increase in number of pipeline stages, but that pipeline length hasn't changed since sandy bridge, because 14 cycle is a sweet spot and engineers won't change that.

>What mattered more than size was node improvements over time.

This is very accurate, and it actually answers your own question, that was node improvements that improved clocks, but right now 14+++ is on the end of the road. There is no obtainable increase in fin pitch and another + in front of that row of +s , so rocket lake can't take advantage of it that much.

>It does, heat density and binning limits what can be realized in actual products

Both power density and absolute power matter, I agree. I was merely talking about single core boost and theoretical maximum frequencies.

>As for binning, if you have 4 cores you are much more likely to find find a top binned piece of silicon than if it has 20 cores.

Completely agree, and I never said anything against it. But the point is bigger dies are easier to cool as the heat transfer is more efficient, take GPUs, we can keep 200w of power cool easily, but we struggle cooling a 120w CPU. And if we look closelier, 9th gen 9700k ran cooler than delidded 8700k with the same artificial power usage because it was bigger.

>Being bigger didn't stop Nehalem from clocking higher than Pennryn, neither did being bigger stop Sandy Bridge from clocking higher than Westmere. 

The clock frequencies those years were more conservative, the power was the defining factor for the clock, but today comet lake SKUs are pushed so hard to the clock limit, and insane clocks above 5 GHz are a norm which was not the case for the previous generations. But I suspect the ""edge"" for rocket lake will not be 5 GHz, rather more normal 4 GHz or so. Which will be noticable for the user.

Adding more cores doesn't limit the clock though, because they work asynchronous, and the biggest synchronous unit (the core) is the same. And also power density remains the same.

I am not setting my words in stone, we should only see the end product.

>all core AVX etc might be lower simply because of the sheer amount of transistors/power usage compared to earlier chips.

For all core turbo though I think rocket lake would be more relaxed, as it will have lower power density, so my expectation is that the gap between single core turbo and multicore turbo will be smaller."

>My point was that in the same node, longer paths results in higher latency, and although building blocks of a cpu is much smaller than a core itself, still some signals need to travel along the core via middle layer metals (top layers are for power delivery for sure).

In the same node, added trace lengths will add capacitance and therefore latency will be higher. Power density won't change the clock, as there is more circuits in a bigger space (so rocket lake can run cooler because of lower clocks)

Also another thing I mentioned somewhere else:

>In room temperature though, we are very close to instability point right now, you can't over clock the comet lake much even on single core even when the temps are in check (except for small hot spots)

So critical path latency is right now defining single core turbo. Multi core turbo and base clock are defined by power envelope and not the critical path"
22732,I,N,T,P,"Yes an important aspect that need light to be shed on, and I'm excited to know that

What happens on liquids nitrogen is that electron mobility in doped silicon semiconductor increases (it actually peaks at around 150 kelvin or -123 °c and then decreases again as it gets to 0 kelvin) so this can improve device's speed. In room temperature though, we are very close to instability point right now, you can't over clock the comet lake much even on single core even when the temps are in check (except for small hot spots)

For IPC, intel reports 18% improvement for sunny cove, willow cove would be higher but not known yet

For the power density, the static and leakage powers definitely get worse in dense nodes, but dynamic power dissipation (which is the main factor in higher clocks) could get better due to lower capacitance.

2. Having a high quality sound system can help a lot in classes, not necessarily an expensive sound card is needed, but a motherboard with high quality on-board sound is a must.

2- bonus: lately a new ""rtx sound"" tool developed by nvidia can remo e all the background sounds other than the voice of the speaker, although this tool can be tweaked to run on modern nvidia gpus with cuda, but having an RTX card is recommended.

22746,I,N,T,P,"Thanks for your detailed answer

Yes, the 1 to 6 core ratio is the turbo you get for single/dual/... threaded workloads respectively, and it is for the turbo boost 2. Also this setting that I pictured in this post acts as an extra limit to keep bad cores from instability if set correctly.



The confusing part (and the blank area in my mind!) begins with the functionality of turbo boost 3.

Let's say you have a 10900k and the ""2 golden cores"" are say core #3 and #7. They are allowed to boost to 5.2ghz. (let's not bring 5.3ghz velocity boost into this, it's already confusing enough!)

Now what happens in windows? The default affinity setting for single threaded workloads lets them wander on every core they want, and if the application by chance sits on core #3 or 7 it gets 5.2ghz, what about other cores? Can it force windows to choose core #3 for this app? If this is the case then can we just imitate this with old ""per core turbo"" setting?

Also the other question is; If this is the case then the impact of turbo boost 3 is very limited, because it's meant to improve single thread performance. Or does it only help in mixed workloads when you have all cores loaded, and you want one golden core to boost independently?"
